        "Title":"Piracetam and piracetam-like drugs: from basic science to novel clinical applications to CNS disorders",
        "Abstract":"There is an increasing interest in nootropic drugs for the treatment of CNS disorders. Since the last meta-analysis of the clinical efficacy of piracetam, more information has accumulated. The primary objective of this systematic survey is to evaluate the clinical outcomes as well as the scientific literature relating to the pharmacology, pharmacokinetics\/pharmacodynamics, mechanism of action, dosing, toxicology and adverse effects of marketed and investigational drugs. The major focus of the literature search was on articles demonstrating evidence-based clinical investigations during the past 10 years for the following therapeutic categories of CNS disorders: (i) cognition\/memory; (ii) epilepsy and seizure; (iii) neurodegenerative diseases; (iv) stroke\/ischaemia; and (v) stress and anxiety. In this article, piracetam-like compounds are divided into three subgroups based on their chemical structures, known efficacy and intended clinical uses. Subgroup 1 drugs include piracetam, oxiracetam, aniracetam, pramiracetam and phenylpiracetam, which have been used in humans and some of which are available as dietary supplements. Of these, oxiracetam and aniracetam are no longer in clinical use. Pramiracetam reportedly improved cognitive deficits associated with traumatic brain injuries. Although piracetam exhibited no long-term benefits for the treatment of mild cognitive impairments, recent studies demonstrated its neuroprotective effect when used during coronary bypass surgery. It was also effective in the treatment of cognitive disorders of cerebrovascular and traumatic origins; however, its overall effect on lowering depression and anxiety was higher than improving memory. As add-on therapy, it appears to benefit individuals with myoclonus epilepsy and tardive dyskinesia. Phenylpiracetam is more potent than piracetam and is used for a wider range of indications. In combination with a vasodilator drug, piracetam appeared to have an additive beneficial effect on various cognitive disabilities. Subgroup 2 drugs include levetiracetam, seletracetam and brivaracetam, which demonstrate antiepileptic activity, although their cognitive effects are unclear. Subgroup 3 includes piracetam derivatives with unknown clinical efficacies, and of these nefiracetam failed to improve cognition in post-stroke patients and rolipram is currently in clinical trials as an antidepressant. The remaining compounds of this subgroup are at various preclinical stages of research. The modes of action of piracetam and most of its derivatives remain an enigma. Differential effects on subtypes of glutamate receptors, but not the GABAergic actions, have been implicated. Piracetam seems to activate calcium influx into neuronal cells; however, this function is questionable in the light of findings that a persistent calcium inflow may have deleterious impact on neuronal cells. Although subgroup 2 compounds act via binding to another neuronal receptor (synaptic vesicle 2A), some of the subgroup 3 compounds, such as nefiracetam, are similar to those of subgroup 1. Based on calculations of the efficacy rates, our assessments indicate notable improvements in clinical outcomes with some of these agents. [References: 151]\n",

        "Abstract":"Although tremor is a highly prevalent movement disorder, progress in this field is limited because of the poor understanding of many of the underlying conditions. This review summarizes recent treatment attempts since 2013. For essential tremor, recent innovations are phase I or II studies of Octanol, several clinically relevant refinements for deep brain stimulation, and the development of the new magnetic resonance imaging guided focused ultrasound technique. Further new invasive and noninvasive electrical and magnetic stimulation techniques have been tested for essential tremor and parkinsonian tremor. For multiple sclerosis tremor, some open-label observations have shown positive results (natalizumab, dalfampridine, levetiracetam), whereas controlled trials using cannabinoids have been negative. Functional tremor has shown a positive response to retrainment. Neuroprosthetic devices have been tested in a variety of tremor conditions. Several promising medical and surgical treatment trials are underway and will be completed shortly. Copyright Â© 2015 International Parkinson and Movement Disorder Society.\n",

        "Abstract":"Pharmacological treatment of Parkinson's disease (PD) is entering a new and exciting era. Real promise now exists for the clinical application of a large range of molecules in development that will combat different aspects and stages of the condition. These include methyl- and ethyl-esterified forms of L-dopa (etilevodopa and melevodopa), inhibitors of enzymes such as monoamine oxidase type-B (eg, rasagiline), catechol-O-methyl transferase (eg, BIA-3202) and the monoamine re-uptake mechanism (eg, brasofensine). In addition, a range of full and partial dopamine agonists (eg, sumanirole, piribedil and BP-897) and their new formulations, for example, patch delivery systems (eg, rotigotine) are being developed. We also highlight non-dopaminergic treatments that will have wide ranging applications in the treatment of PD and L-dopa-induced dyskinesia. These include alpha2 adrenergic receptor antagonists (eg, fipamezole), adenosine A2A receptor antagonists (eg, istradefylline), AMPA receptor antagonists (eg, talampanel), neuronal synchronization modulators (eg, levetiracetam) and agents that interact with serotonergic systems such as 5-hydroxytryptamine (5-HT)1A agonists (eg, sarizotan) and 5-HT2A antagonists (eg, quetiapine). Lastly, we examine a growing number of neuroprotective agents that seek to halt or even reverse disease progression. These include anti-apoptotic kinase inhibitors (eg, CEP-1347), modulators of mitochondrial function (eg, creatine), growth factors (eg, leteprinim), neuroimmunophilins (eg, V-10367), estrogens (eg, MITO-4509), c-synuclein oligomerization inhibitors (eg, PAN-408) and sonic hedgehog ligands.

        "Abstract":"This report reviews behavioral adverse events occurring among adults receiving levetiracetam (LEV) or placebo who participated in short-term, placebo-controlled studies in epilepsy (1023), cognitive disorders (719), or anxiety disorders (1510) and epilepsy patients (1393) observed in long-term trials. Behavioral events (affective, psychotic, and suicidal symptoms) were significantly more common among epilepsy patients than cognition or anxiety patients treated with LEV for similar durations (P=0.022). Affective symptoms occurring at 1% or more often in epilepsy placebo-controlled trials included depression (3.8% LEV-2.1% placebo), nervousness (3.8%-1.8%), hostility (2.3%-0.9%), anxiety (1.8%-1.1%), and emotional lability (1.7%-0.2%). Patients with cognitive and anxiety disorders had lower incidences of these symptoms. The incidence of behavioral events in LEV-treated epilepsy patients was lower than rates reported for some other antiepileptic drugs. These data support the hypothesis that some feature related to epilepsy is the cause of many behavioral events rather than the addition of a specific antiepileptic drug.\n",

        "Abstract":"Studies of individuals with amnestic mild cognitive impairment (aMCI) have detected hyperactivity in the hippocampus during task-related functional magnetic resonance imaging (fMRI). Such elevated activation has been localized to the hippocampal dentate gyrus\/CA3 (DG\/CA3) during performance of a task designed to detect the computational contributions of those hippocampal circuits to episodic memory. The current investigation was conducted to test the hypothesis that greater hippocampal activation in aMCI represents a dysfunctional shift in the normal computational balance of the DG\/CA3 regions, augmenting CA3-driven pattern completion at the expense of pattern separation mediated by the dentate gyrus. We tested this hypothesis using an intervention based on animal research demonstrating a beneficial effect on cognition by reducing excess hippocampal neural activity with low doses of the atypical anti-epileptic levetiracetam. In a within-subject design we assessed the effects of levetiracetam in three cohorts of aMCI participants, each receiving a different dose of levetiracetam. Elevated activation in the DG\/CA3 region, together with impaired task performance, was detected in each aMCI cohort relative to an aged control group. We observed significant improvement in memory task performance under drug treatment relative to placebo in the aMCI cohorts at the 62.5 and 125 mg BID doses of levetiracetam. Drug treatment in those cohorts increased accuracy dependent on pattern separation processes and reduced errors attributable to an over-riding effect of pattern completion while normalizing fMRI activation in the DG\/CA3 and entorhinal cortex. Similar to findings in animal studies, higher dosing at 250 mg BID had no significant benefit on either task performance or fMRI activation. Consistent with predictions based on the computational functions of the DG\/CA3 elucidated in basic animal research, these data support a dysfunctional encoding mechanism detected by fMRI in individuals with aMCI and therapeutic intervention using fMRI to detect target engagement in response to treatment.\n",

        "Abstract":"Psychotropics (antipsychotics, mood stabilizers, antidepressants, anxiolytics, etc.) are commonly prescribed to treat Huntington's disease (HD). In HD preclinical models, while no psychotropic has convincingly affected huntingtin gene, HD modifying gene, or huntingtin protein expression, psychotropic neuroprotective effects include upregulated huntingtin autophagy (lithium), histone acetylation (lithium, valproate, lamotrigine), miR-222 (lithium-plus-valproate), mitochondrial protection (haloperidol, trifluoperazine, imipramine, desipramine, nortriptyline, maprotiline, trazodone, sertraline, venlafaxine, melatonin), neurogenesis (lithium, valproate, fluoxetine, sertraline), and BDNF (lithium, valproate, sertraline) and downregulated AP-1 DNA binding (lithium), p53 (lithium), huntingtin aggregation (antipsychotics, lithium), and apoptosis (trifluoperazine, loxapine, lithium, desipramine, nortriptyline, maprotiline, cyproheptadine, melatonin). In HD live mouse models, delayed disease onset (nortriptyline, melatonin), striatal preservation (haloperidol, tetrabenazine, lithium, sertraline), memory preservation (imipramine, trazodone, fluoxetine, sertraline, venlafaxine), motor improvement (tetrabenazine, lithium, valproate, imipramine, nortriptyline, trazodone, sertraline, venlafaxine), and extended survival (lithium, valproate, sertraline, melatonin) have been documented. Upregulated CREB binding protein (CBP; valproate, dextromethorphan) and downregulated histone deacetylase (HDAC; valproate) await demonstration in HD models. Most preclinical findings await replication and their limitations are reviewed. The most promising findings involve replicated striatal neuroprotection and phenotypic disease modification in transgenic mice for tetrabenazine and for sertraline. Clinical data consist of an uncontrolled lithium case series (n = 3) suggesting non-progression and a primarily negative double-blind, placebo-controlled clinical trial of lamotrigine.\n",

        "Abstract":"BACKGROUND: Any type of seizure can be observed in Alzheimer's disease (AD). Antiepileptic drugs seem to prevent the recurrence of epileptic seizures in most people with AD. There are pharmacological and non-pharmacological treatments for epilepsy in people with AD. There are no current systematic reviews to evaluate the efficacy and tolerability of the treatment. This review aims to review those different modalities.\nOBJECTIVES: To assess the efficacy and tolerability of the treatment of epilepsy for people with Alzheimer's disease (AD) (including sporadic AD and dominantly inherited AD).\nSEARCH METHODS: We searched the Cochrane Epilepsy Group Specialized Register (1 February 2016), the Cochrane Central Register of Controlled Trials (1 February 2016), MEDLINE (Ovid, 1 February 2016) and ClinicalTrials.gov (1 February 2016). In an effort to identify further published, unpublished and ongoing trials, we searched ongoing trials' registers, reference lists and relevant conference proceedings, and contacted authors and pharmaceutical companies.\nSELECTION CRITERIA: We included randomised and quasi-randomised controlled trials investigating treatment for epilepsy in people with AD, with the outcomes of proportion of seizure freedom or experiencing adverse events.\nDATA COLLECTION AND ANALYSIS: Two review authors independently screened the titles and abstracts of identified records, selected studies for inclusion, extracted data, cross-checked the data for accuracy and assessed the methodological quality. We performed no meta-analyses due to the limited available data.\nMAIN RESULTS: We included one randomised controlled trial with 95 participants. Concerning the proportion of participants with seizure freedom, no significant differences were found in levetiracetam (LEV) versus lamotrigine (LTG) (risk ratio (RR) 1.20, 95% confidence interval (CI) 0.53 to 2.71), in levetiracetam versus phenobarbital (PB) (RR 1.01, 95% CI 0.47 to 2.19), or in LTG versus PB (RR 0.84, 95% CI 0.35 to 2.02). It seemed that LEV could improve cognition and LTG could relieve depression; while PB and LTG could worsen cognition, and LEV and PB could worsen mood. We judged the quality of the evidence to be very low.\nAUTHORS' CONCLUSIONS: This review does not provide sufficient evidence to support LEV, PB and LTG for the treatment of epilepsy in people with AD. Regarding the efficacy and tolerability, no significant differences were found between LEV, PB and LTG. In the future, large randomised, double-blind, controlled, parallel-group clinical trials are required to determine the efficacy and tolerability of treatment for epilepsy in people with AD.\n",

        "Abstract":"Seizures occur at a higher frequency in people with Alzheimer's disease (AD) but overt, clinically obvious events are infrequent. Evidence from animal models and studies in mild cognitive impairment suggest that subclinical epileptic discharges may play a role in the clinical and pathophysiological manifestations of AD. In this feasibility study, the neurophysiological and cognitive effects of acute administration of levetiracetam (LEV) are measured in patients with mild AD to test whether it could have a therapeutic benefit. AD participants were administered low dose LEV (2.5 mg\/kg), higher dose LEV (7.5 mg\/kg), or placebo in a double-blind, within-subject repeated measures study with EEG recorded at rest before and after administration. After administration of higher dose of LEV, we found significant decreases in coherence in the delta band (1-3.99 Hz) and increases in the low beta (13-17.99 Hz) and the high beta band (24-29.99 Hz). Furthermore, we found trends toward increased power in the frontal and central regions in the high beta band (24-29.99 Hz). However, there were no significant changes in cognitive performance after this single dose administration. The pattern of decreased coherence in the lower frequency bands and increased coherence in the higher frequency bands suggests a beneficial effect of LEV for patients with AD. Larger longitudinal studies and studies with healthy age-matched controls are needed to determine whether this represents a relative normalization of EEG patterns, whether it is unique to AD as compared to normal aging, and whether longer term administration is associated with a beneficial clinical effect.\n",

        "Abstract":"Among people with epilepsy, there is a 20-fold higher risk of dying suddenly and unexpectedly compared with the general population. This phenomenon is called sudden unexpected death in epilepsy (SUDEP) and the term is used when sudden death occurs in an otherwise reasonably healthy person with epilepsy and the autopsy is unrevealing. In most cases, SUDEP occurs during sleep and is unwitnessed. Risk factors for SUDEP include the presence or number of generalized tonic-clonic seizures (GTCS), nocturnal seizures, young age at epilepsy onset, longer duration of epilepsy, dementia, absence of cerebrovascular disease, asthma, male gender, symptomatic aetiology of epilepsy and alcohol abuse. Suggested factors predisposing to SUDEP have included long-QT-related mutations, impaired serotonergic brain stem control of respiration, altered autonomic control and seizures with a pronounced postictal suppression and respiratory compromise. Final events that may lead up to SUDEP are a postictal CNS shutdown with pronounced EEG suppression, ictal or postictal apnoea, and ictal cardiac arrhythmia. It is unknown whether antiepileptic drugs (AEDs) modify the risk for SUDEP. Studies have consistently found that the presence or number of GTCS is associated with an increased risk for SUDEP. Since continued presence of GTCS clearly necessitates the use of AEDs, both factors must be taken into account to determine whether one or both increases the risk for SUDEP. Some studies suggest that AEDs, such as lamotrigine and carbamazepine, may increase the risk of SUDEP, but rarely adjust for GTCS. Other studies, which have found that AEDs are associated with a decreased SUDEP risk, either adjust for the number of GTCS or are meta-analyses of randomized clinical trials. Studies assessing the impact of AEDs on the risk for SUDEP are limited because SUDEP is a rare event, making randomized clinical trials impossible to conduct. Observational studies focus on whether or not an AED was prescribed. When postmortem AED concentrations are assessed they are usually low or absent, perhaps due to sampling in deceased individuals, making it difficult to fully resolve whether AEDs increase or decrease SUDEP risk. Despite these caveats, the evidence suggests that AEDs are not associated with an increased risk for SUDEP on a population level, although some individuals may be susceptible to effects of AEDs. Recent evidence from a meta-analysis of randomized clinical trials of adjunctive AEDs at efficacious doses provides strong support for AED treatment as mono- or polytherapy to increase seizure control and protect against SUDEP in patients with refractory epilepsy. For patients for whom seizure control is unattainable, supervision or monitoring may prevent SUDEP, though this has never been formally tested.\n",

        "Abstract":"Behavioral and psychological symptoms of dementia (BPSD) are common and debilitating problems, but current treatments are limited. Antipsychotic agents show some efficacy on BPSD, but their use is limited by the associated risk of cerebrovascular events and mortality. Reports have shown the efficacy of mood stabilizers on BPSD, but systemic reviews on this issue are scant. This article aims to review studies of the efficacy of mood stabilizers on BPSD, and the quality of the available evidence. We searched for articles published in English during the period 1990 to 2010 and included in the PubMed database that concerned treatment of BPSD with mood stabilizers, such as carbamazepine, valproate, gabapentin, topiramate, lamotrigine, oxcarbazepine and lithium. The quality of the studies was assessed by considering the trial designs, analyses, subjects and results. We found one meta-analysis and three randomized controlled trials (RCTs) supporting the efficacy of carbamazepine in managing global BPSD, particularly aggression and hostility. With regard to valproate, current evidence from one meta-analysis and five RCTs did not strongly support its efficacy for global BPSD, including agitation and aggression. Only open trials or case series showed some efficacy of gabapentin, topiramate and lamotrigine in controlling BPSD. The single RCT investigating the effect of oxcarbazepine on agitation and aggression showed negative results. Case series reports on lithium tended to show it to be ineffective. Thus far, among mood stabilizers, carbamazepine has the most robust evidence of efficacy on BPSD. More RCTs are needed to strengthen evidence regarding the efficacy of gabapentin, topiramate and lamotrigine. Valproate, oxcarbazepine and lithium showed low or no evidence of efficacy. Large and well designed RCTs focusing on specific symptoms of BPSD are needed to deal with the issue. Copyright Â© 2012. Published by Elsevier B.V.\n",

We investigated the effects of lamotrigine (LTG), a glutamate-release inhibitor, in the symptomatic treatment of IP in two double-blind, placebo-controlled studies. Single doses of L-dopa\/carbidopa (equal to 50% of the usual morning dose) were administered together with either LTG (100, 200, or 400 mg) or two random placebo doses in 14 patients with IP. The patients were assessed using the Modified Columbia Rating Scale (MCRS) and the Purdue Pegboard Test (PPBT) at multiple intervals over 8 hours. There were no significant differences between the placebo doses and the three doses of LTG on the MCRS and PPBT scores. In a 3-month study, 12 patients took LTG titrated up to 400 mg or placebo with their antiparkinsonian medication for 3 months and were then crossed over. Nine of 12 patients did not complete the study because of dyskinesia (n = 2), hallucinations (n = 3), and deterioration of parkinsonian symptoms (n = 4) on LTG.

        "Abstract":"PD is a neurodegenerative disorder triggered by genetic and\/or environmental factors and the pathological processes begin many years before motor symptom manifestation. Several drugs are available to treat PD, but there are still many aspects of the disease that have not been well addressed. These include nonmotor symptoms, disease progression, and preventing levodopa-induced motor complications. Besides the concept of continuous dopaminergic stimulation, the benefit of which has not been proved in clinical settings (see the STRIDE-PD trial), the nondopaminergic drugs offer promising alternatives to dopaminergic medication. However, modification and further development of dopaminergic molecules may provide significant symptomatic improvement and improved quality of life. In this review, we summarized new treatments that are in the pipeline, with patients being recruited for clinical trials. Among the compounds being studied are well-known ones (e.g., folic acid or methylphenidate), which have been used in other diseases, and newly developed drugs with known mode of action (e.g., the dopamine agonist aplindore) or compounds with completely new mechanisms, which have not yet been used in clinical settings (e.g., levetiracetam or Neu 120). A major breakthrough in treating Parkinson's disease cannot be expected with molecules from the first two cases, whereas significant clinical benefits can be predicted with the drugs in the last group. However, without these large-scale, well-designed, multicenter trials, the promising preclinical results cannot be directly adopted in patient care. Hopefully, some of these trials will end soon with positive results, and certain drugs will become available with which to treat PD patients, although still many aspects (e.g., the most problematic one, the question of neuroprotection) still need to be addressed.

This was a prospective, randomized, three-arm parallel-group, case-control study of 95 patients taking LEV (n=38), phenobarbital (PB) (n=28), and lamotrigine (LTG) (n=29). A 4-week dose adjustment was followed by a 12-month evaluation period. The three groups were compared to a control group (n=68) to evaluate cognitive effects of the antiepileptic drugs. We examined drug effects cross-sectionally at baseline, 6 months, and 12 months. There were no significant differences in efficacy among the three AEDs. LEV caused fewer adverse events than the other AEDs. PB produced persistent negative cognitive side effects. LEV was associated with improved cognitive performance, specifically attention level and oral fluency items. LTG had a better effect on mood. LEV had a benign neuropsychological side effect profile, making it a cognitively safe drug to use for controlling established seizures in elderly patients with Alzheimer's disease.

        "Abstract":"Elevated hippocampal activation is observed in conditions that confer risk for Alzheimer's disease, including amnestic mild cognitive impairment (aMCI). Studies in relevant animal models have indicated that overactivity in selective hippocampal circuits contributes to cognitive impairment. Here, we tested the effect of reducing hippocampal activation in aMCI. Under placebo treatment, hippocampal activation in the dentate gyrus\/CA3 was elevated in aMCI patients compared to a healthy control group. By using a low dose of the antiepileptic levetiracetam hippocampal activation in aMCI was reduced to a level that did not differ from the control group. Compared to aMCI memory performance under placebo, performance in the scanning task was significantly improved under drug treatment. Contrary to the view that greater hippocampal activation might serve a beneficial function, these results support the view that increased hippocampal activation in aMCI is a dysfunctional condition and that targeting excess hippocampal activity has therapeutic potential.

Moreover, most known antiglutamatergic compounds act postsynaptically and are either toxic or weak with regard to their clinical potency. The antiepileptic drug \"Lamotrigine (LTG)\" inhibits presynaptic glutamate release and may therefore provide a novel approach for PD therapy. Encouraging results from a pilot project led us to establish a placebo controlled trial including 20 patients with PD. The substance was generally well tolerated. There was a significant difference in the investigator's overall assessment of efficacy (6\/10 vs. 2\/10 improvement; p < 0.05) and a tendency for LTG to exhibit a beneficial effect in some registration parameters, but no significant differences in motor response were found between the two groups. We failed to confirm that LTG mediates a strong antiparkinsonian effect in this small study, but to clearly demonstrate slight or moderate beneficial effects larger groups are required.\n",

        "Abstract":"The current development of emerging pharmacological treatments for Parkinson's disease (PD), front preclinical to launch, is summarized. Advances over the past year are highlighted, including the significant progress of several drugs through various stages of development. Several agents have been discontinued from development, either because of adverse effects or lack of clinical efficacy. The methyl-esterified form of L-DOPA (melevodopa) and the monoamine oxidase type B inhibitor rasagiline have both been launched. With regard to the monoamine re-uptake inhibitors, many changes have been witnessed, with new agents reaching preclinical development and pre-existing ones being discontinued or having no development reported. Of the dopamine agonists, many continue to progress successfully through clinical trials. Others have struggled to demonstrate a significant advantage over currently available treatments and have been discontinued. The field of non-dopaminergic treatments remains dynamic. The alpha2 adrenergic receptor antagonists and the adenosine A2A receptor antagonists remain in clinical trials. Trials of the neuronal' synchronization modulator levetiracetam are at an advanced stage, and there has also been a new addition to the class (ie, seletracetam). There has been a change in the landscape of neuroprotective agents that modulate disease progression. Candidates from the classes of growth factors and glyceraldehyde-3-phosphate dehydrogenase inhibitors have been discontinued, or no development has been reported, and the mixed lineage kinase inhibitor CEP-1347 has been discontinued for PD treatment. Other drugs in this field, such as neuroimmunophilins, estrogens and alpha-synuclein oligomerization inhibitors, remain in development. [References: 87]\n",

The LEV database includes reports of TEAE from trials of patients with diagnoses of a cognitive disorder (N=719), an anxiety disorder (N=1510), or localization-related epilepsy (N=1023) who participated in clinical trials lasting up to 16 weeks. Patients were grouped as young (<65 years) or elderly (> or = 65 years). The most common TEAE occurring most frequently in the LEV-treated groups were abdominal pain, asthenia, headache, anorexia, weight loss, dizziness, insomnia, somnolence, and tremor. The only significant differences in TEAE were seen between young and elderly groups with anxiety disorders (>3% higher for LEV than for placebo-treated patients) in headache (5.2% elderly, -0.9% young, P=0.041), and tremor (5.2 and -0.5%, respectively, P=0.022) and between young anxiety patients and young epilepsy patients for somnolence (-0.7 and 5.4%, respectively, P=0.036). For the other TEAEs there was no evidence for consistent differences between young and elderly patients and between patients with different CNS disorders. Overall, LEV was well tolerated by all patient groups. The favorable adverse event profile suggests that LEV might be suitable for use by elderly patients.\n",

Analyses included 3347 patients exposed to LEV in clinical trials for epilepsy, cognition, and anxiety disorders.\nRESULTS: Safety data from all studies depict a similar pattern of adverse effects, predominantly somnolence, asthenia, and dizziness that occurred most frequently during the first month of LEV treatment. Changes in laboratory test values from placebo-controlled trials that were statistically significant remained in the normal range (red blood cells, hematocrit, hemoglobin, white blood cells, and neutrophils). Reports of the coding term 'infection' (common cold, upper respiratory infection) were not preceded by low neutrophil counts that might suggest impaired immunological status. Selection of adverse event coding terms probably contributed to the high rate of adverse effects termed 'infection.' Higher incidences of adverse effects, particularly behavioral effects, were found among epilepsy patients than in elderly patients with cognitive disorders or patients with anxiety disorders given lower doses.\nCONCLUSIONS: This review of patients evaluated during the clinical development program suggests that LEV was well tolerated and safe for patients with seizure, cognitive and anxiety disorders. Overall incidence of adverse effects in the LEV groups was little higher than reports from the placebo groups. Of course, this data was derived from clinical trials that are of relatively short duration, and provide data on only several thousand patients. Therefore, long-term side effects, and\/or rare side effects cannot be ruled out on the basis of this analysis. [References: 16]\n",

The primary response variable was total functional capacity (TFC) score. Secondary response variables included the quantified neurological examination and a set of cognitive and motor tests. Repeated fluorodeoxyglucose measurements of regional cerebral metabolism using PET also were included.\nRESULTS: Fifty-five patients (28 on lamotrigine, 27 on placebo) completed the study. Neither the primary response variable nor any of the secondary response variables differed significantly between the treatment groups. Both the lamotrigine and the placebo group deteriorated significantly on the TFC, in the lamotrigine group by 1.89 and the placebo group by 2.11 points. No effect of CAG size on the rate of deterioration could be detected.\nCONCLUSIONS: There was no clear evidence that lamotrigine retarded the progression of early Huntington disease over a period of 30 months. However, more patients on lamotrigine reported symptomatic improvement (53.6 versus 14.8%; p = 0.006), and a trend toward decreased chorea was evident in the treated group (p = 0.08).

        "Abstract":"OPINION STATEMENT: There are currently no disease-modifying treatments for progressive supranuclear palsy (PSP) or corticobasal degeneration (CBD), and no approved pharmacological or therapeutic treatments that are effective in controlling their symptoms. The use of most pharmacological treatment options are based on experience in other disorders or from non-randomized historical controls, case series, or expert opinion. Levodopa may provide some improvement in symptoms of Parkinsonism (specifically bradykinesia and rigidity) in PSP and CBD; however, evidence is conflicting and where present, benefits are often negligible and short lived. In fact, \"poor\" response to levodopa forms part of the NINDS-SPSP criteria for the diagnosis of PSP and consensus criteria for the diagnosis of CBD (Lang Mov Disord. 20 Suppl 1:S83-91, 2005; Litvan et al. Neurology. 48:119-25, 1997; Armstrong et al. Neurology. 80(5):496-503, 2013). There is some evidence that intrasalivery gland botulinum toxin is useful in managing problematic sialorrhea and that intramuscular botulinum toxin and baclofen are helpful in reducing dystonia, including blepharospasm. Benzodiazepines may also be useful in managing dystonia. Myoclonus may be managed using levetiracetam and benzodiazepines. Pharmacological agents licensed for Alzheimer's disease (such as acetylcholinesterase inhibitors and N-Methyl-D-aspartate receptor antagonists) have been used off-label in PSP, CBD, and other tauopathies with the aim of improving cognition; however, there is limited evidence that they are effective and risk of adverse effects may outweigh benefits. The use of atypical antipsychotics for behavioural symptoms is not recommended in the elderly or those with demetia associated conditions and most antipsychotics will worsen Parkinsonism. Antidepressants may be useful for behavioral symptoms and depression but are often poorly tolerated due to adverse effects. In the absence of an effective drug treatment to target the underlying cause of CBD and PSP, management should focus on optimizing quality of life, relieving symptoms and assisting patients with their activities of daily living (ADL). Patients should be managed by a multidisciplinary team consisting of neurologists, physiotherapists (PT), occupational therapists (OT), speech and language therapists (SALT), dieticians, ophthalmologists, psychologists, and palliative care specialists.\n",

        "Abstract":"BACKGROUND: Recent studies indicate that modulation of glutamate neurotransmission is associated with antidepressant response. Lamotrigine, an anticonvulsant which decreases presynaptic glutamate release, has been shown to be effective in the depressive phase of bipolar disorder (BD-D); however, only 40-50% of patients have a full response. This pilot study investigated whether memantine, a low-affinity N-methyl-D-aspartate (NMDA) receptor antagonist approved for Alzheimer's disease, can augment the effects of lamotrigine.\nMETHODS: BD-D outpatients in a major depressive episode on a stable dose of lamotrigine (100 mg or more) were randomized to either memantine (starting dose of 5 mg increased up to 20 mg over four weeks, then 20 mg stable dose from four to eight weeks) or matching pill placebo for eight weeks. Patients were rated on the 17-item Hamilton Depression Rating Scale (HDRS) and other behavioral measures weekly.\nRESULTS: The eight-week repeated-measures mixed-effect model for HDRS was not significant for memantine (n = 14) versus placebo (n = 15). Exploratory mixed-effect analyses for the first four weeks, while the memantine dose was being titrated up every week, revealed a significant decrease in HDRS scores from baseline (p = 0.007).\nCONCLUSION: This proof-of-concept study failed to show a statistically significant benefit of memantine augmentation of lamotrigine for patients with BD-D over eight weeks. However, memantine had an antidepressant effect early on in the treatment while its dose was being titrated up. Larger placebo-controlled studies are needed to ascertain optimal timing and dosing for memantine augmentation of lamotrigine in BD-D. Copyright Â© 2012 John Wiley and Sons A\/S.\n",

        "Abstract":"Levetiracetam (LEV), a second-generation anti-epileptic drug, is used for treatment of both focal and generalized epilepsy. Growing body of evidence suggests that LEV may have neuroprotective effects. The present study was undertaken to investigate the neuroprotective effects of LEV on rotenone-induced Parkinson's disease (PD) in rats. Twenty-four adult Sprague-Dawley rats were infused with rotenone (3 mug\/mul in DMSO) or vehicle (1 mul DMSO) into the left substantia nigra pars compacta (SNc) under stereotaxic surgery. PD model was assessed by rotational test ten days after drug infusion. The valid PD rats were randomly distributed into two groups; Group 1 (n=8) and Group 2 (n=8) were administered saline (1 ml\/kg\/day, i.p.) and LEV (600 mg\/kg\/day, i.p.) through 21 days, respectively. The effects of LEV treatment were evaluated by behavioral (rotation score), biochemical (brain homovalinic acid level and oxidant\/antioxidant status) and immunohistochemical (tyrosine hydroxylase) parameters. Apomorphine-induced rotations in PD rats were significantly suppressed by LEV treatment. While unilateral rotenone lesion induced a dramatic loss of dopaminergic neurons both in the striatum and SNc, LEV treatment significantly attenuated the degenerative changes in dopaminergic neurons. Furthermore, LEV significantly decreased lipid peroxide levels, a marker of lipid peroxidation, and induced glutathione levels, catalase and superoxide dismutase activity in PD rats compared with saline group. We conclude that LEV may have beneficial effects on dopaminergic neurons against rotenone-induced injury. The underlying mechanism may be associated with the attenuation of oxidative stress.

        "Abstract":"INTRODUCTION: Dementia, besides the dominant cognitive disorders that define it, is associated with behavioral disturbances, the consequences of which are, on various levels, a determining factor for the handling of these patients. The treatment of behavioral and psychological symptoms is essential and although, to date, no therapeutic solution is satisfactory, it is necessary to look for an alternative to the neuroleptics usually employed, which raise real problems of tolerance in this geriatric population.\nBACKGROUND: For several years, anticonvulsants, among which some have shown mood stabilizing activity, have been the object of research in this indication. The purpose of this review of the literature is to assess the interest and the limits of anticonvulsant mood stabilizers (carbamazepine, valproic acid, gabapentin, lamotrigine, topiramate, oxcarbazepine) in the treatment of the so-called \"noncognitive\" symptoms of dementia. Their mechanism of action in mood disorders is not well known, but it would appear to be via the modulation of glutamate-mediated excitatory synaptic transmission and gamma-aminobutyric acid (GABA)-mediated inhibitory synaptic transmission that anticonvulsants might reduce behavioral symptoms in demented patients.\nMETHODS: The method employed in this work was a systematic bibliographic review, in which only the double-blind placebo-controlled studies or the clinically detailed enough open-labelled studies using validated scales were retained.\nRESULTS: Among these medications, only carbamazepine demonstrated its efficacy in behavioral and psychological symptoms of dementia (BPSD) in controlled studies, notably that of Tariot et al. [J Am Geriatr Soc 42 (1994) 1160-1166 and Am J Psychiatry 155 (1998) 54-61] and Olin et al. [Am J Geriatr Psychiatry 9 (2001) 400-405], but with significant adverse events (sedation, hyponatremia, cardiac toxicity), particularly in the elderly and, being a strong enzymatic inducer, with a high likelihood of drug-drug interactions. Valproic acid showed some interesting results in BPSD within a large number of open studies and case reports. However, among the five controlled studies that have been published [Curr Ther Res 62 (2001) 51-67; Am J Geriatr Psychiatry 9 (2001) 58-66; Int J Geriatr Psychiatry 17 (2002) 579-585; Curr Alzheimer Res 2 (2005) 553-558 and Am J Geraitr Psychiatry 13 (2005) 942-945], none confirmed its efficacy on these symptoms. Regarding its tolerability in the geriatric population, no notable major side effect was reported (haematologic and hepatic effects are not more frequent than in the general population), except possible excessive sedation. Moreover, it appears that valproic acid could have neuroprotective effects, even if the contrary has been observed in a recent study. More studies need to be (and are being) conducted, notably on the interest of valproic acid in prophylaxis of BPSD. Gabapentin seems to be worthwhile and well tolerated in this indication, but no controlled study has been conducted to prove its efficacy, even if a quite important number of case reports and open studies have shown encouraging results. Concerning lamotrigine, which may potentially induce severe cutaneous side effects when administered with valproic acid, this drug has shown its efficacy in bipolar disorders and two recent case reports seem to indicate some interest in BPSD. Furthermore, lamotrigine appears to have neuroprotective effects. Although topiramate has shown interesting results in one open study in BPSD, its use in demented patients cannot be recommended because of its deleterious effect on cognitive functions. Oxcarbazepine, theoretically, could be an alternative to carbamazepine, which is, as aforesaid, the only anticonvulsant that proved its interest in BPSD. However, no clinical study has yet been published to support this hypothesis. This drug is better tolerated than carbamazepine, but induces severe and more frequent hyponatremia.\nDISCUSSION AND CONCLUSION: Finally, although we all know that antipsychotics should no longer be prescribed in the elderly, the treatment of behavioral and psychological symptoms of dementia remains a difficult problem, considering the lack of a real alternative to these medications. Anticonvulsant mood stabilizers are an interesting solution but none of them, other than carbamazepine, which did, but which is not better tolerated than the usual drugs in this population - was able to prove its efficacy in this indication. Among these medications, valproic acid, gabapentin and lamotrigine should be studied further, and the neuroprotective effect of some of them is an interesting route for research. [References: 48]\n",

        "Abstract":"The aim of this study was to assess the efficacy, safety and tolerability of the antiepileptic compound levetiracetam (LEV) for the treatment of levodopa-induced dyskinesia (LID) in Parkinson's disease (PD). We thus performed a randomized, double-blind, placebo-controlled, parallel-group pilot study in PD patients with moderate-to-severe LID on stable dopaminergic therapy. Placebo or LEV was administered twice daily (titrated from 250 to 2,000 mg\/day) as add-on therapy. Subjects underwent evaluation of the unified-PD-rating scale (UPDRS) and the modified abnormal involuntary movement scale (AIMS). The primary outcome variable was the change of the AIMS score between baseline and end-of-treatment visit. Secondary variables included total UPDRS score and response to levodopa challenge. Of 32 randomized patients (mean age 65.2 years, 62.5% women), 17 received LEV and 15 placebo. After 11 weeks of treatment, mean changes of the modified AIMS from baseline were -1.5 (-26%) for LEV (p = 0.332) and +0.9 (+13%) for placebo (p = 0.588) without significant differences between groups. Mean changes of the UPDRS item 32\/33 sum score from baseline showed significant improvement of dyskinesia in the LEV group [-1.0 (-20%); p = 0.012], but not in the placebo group [-0.4 (-8%); p = 0.306]. Treatment had no effects on UPDRS motor score or levodopa response. Frequency and quality of adverse events were similar in both treatment groups. Together, LEV showed only mild antidyskinetic effects without worsening of Parkinsonian symptoms or compromising levodopa efficacy. LEV was well tolerated in doses up to 2,000 mg\/day. Further large controlled studies are warranted to evaluate the impact of LEV on LID in PD patients.\n",

        "Abstract":"To describe the association between Alzheimer's disease and seizures by reviewing epidemiological data from available literature and to assess the putative pathophysiological links between neurodegeneration and altered cortical excitability. We also discuss specific antiepileptic treatment strategies in patients with Alzheimer's disease, as well as transient epileptic amnesia as a possible crossroads between degeneration and epilepsy. Regarding epidemiology, we searched publications in Pubmed, Medline, Scopus and Web of Science (until September 2015) using the keywords \"incidence\", \"prevalence\" and \"frequency\", as well as \"Alzheimer's disease\" and \"seizures\". In addition, therapeutic aspects for seizures in Alzheimer's disease were searched using the key words \"antiepileptic drugs\", \"seizure treatment\" and \"Alzheimer\". The prevalence and incidence rates of seizures were found to be increased 2 to 6-fold in patients with Alzheimer's disease compared to age-adjusted control patients. Treatment strategies have mainly been extrapolated from elderly patients without dementia, except for one single randomised trial, in which levetiracetam, lamotrigine and phenobarbital efficacy and tolerance were investigated in patients with Alzheimer's disease. Mouse models appear to show a major role of amyloid precursor protein and its cleavage products in the generation of cortical hyperexcitability. A link between Alzheimer's disease and epilepsy has long been described and recent cohort studies have more clearly delineated risk factors associated with the genesis of seizures, such as early onset and possibly severity of dementia. As genetic forms of Alzheimer's disease and experimental mouse models suggest, beta-amyloid may play a prominent role in the propagation of synchronised abnormal discharges, perhaps more via an excitatory mode than a direct neurodegenerative effect.\n",

        "Abstract":"AIM: We investigated the clinical efficacy and changes in the dosages of concomitantly used psychotropic drugs in lamotrigine therapy in Alzheimer's disease with behavioural and psychological symptoms of dementia (BPSD).\nMETHODS: This study was a 16-week, preliminary open-label trial. The subjects were 40 inpatients. The outcome measures assessed were BPSD and cognitive function. BPSD was assessed with the Neuropsychiatric Inventory (NPI) and cognitive function was assessed with the Mini-Mental State Examination. The changes in the dosages of concomitant psychotropic drugs were also assessed.\nRESULTS: Although the mean changes from baseline NPI scores and the two NPI subscales (anxiety and irritability) were significantly lower within the lamotrigine therapy group, no significant differences were found when we compared the lamotrigine therapy group to the control group. The mean decrease from baseline on the NPI agitation subscale, however, was significantly greater in the lamotrigine therapy group than in the control group (P < 0.05). Furthermore, the mean decrease from baseline in the diazepam-equivalent dose was significantly greater in the lamotrigine therapy group than in the control group (P < 0.05).\nCONCLUSIONS: The results of this study suggest that the administration of lamotrigine to patients with severe Alzheimer's disease with BPSD may be effective and may make it possible to avoid increasing the dosage of antipsychotic medications prescribed to elderly patients.

        "Title":"Myoclonus",
        "Abstract":"PURPOSE OF REVIEW: Myoclonus remains a challenging movement phenotype to characterize, evaluate, and treat. A systematic assessment of the temporal sequence, phenomenology, and distribution of movements can assist in the rational approach to diagnosis and management.\nRECENT FINDINGS: Cortical forms of myoclonus are increasingly recognized as primarily cerebellar disorders. A syndrome of orthostatic myoclonus has been recognized by electrophysiology in patients with neurodegenerative disorders, mainly in Alzheimer disease, accounting for impairments in gait and balance previously mischaracterized as normal pressure hydrocephalus or orthostatic tremor. Tyrosine hydroxylase deficiency and Silver-Russell syndrome (uniparental disomy of chromosome 7) have been established as two novel causes of the myoclonus-dystonia syndrome. Mutations in the glycine receptor (GlyR) alpha1-subunit gene (GLRA1) explain the major expression of hyperekplexia, an inherited excessive startle disorder, butnewly identified mutations in GlyR beta-subunit (GLRB) and glycine transporter 2 (GlyT2) genes (SLC6A5) account for \"minor\" forms of this disorder manifested as excessive startle and hypnic jerks. The entity previously known as palatal myoclonus has been reclassified as palatal tremor in recognition of its clinical and electromyographic features and no longer enters the differential diagnosis of myoclonic disorders. Increasing documentation of psychogenic features in patients previously characterized as having propriospinal myoclonus has cast doubts on the existence of this distinctive disorder.\nSUMMARY: Myoclonus can be a prominent manifestation of a wide range of disorders. Electrophysiologic testing aids in distinguishing myoclonus from other mimics and classifying them according to cortical, subcortical, or spinal origin, which assists the choice of treatment. Despite the lack of randomized clinical trials, levetiracetam appears most effective in patients with cortical myoclonus, whereas clonazepam remains the only first-line therapeutic option in subcortical and spinal myoclonus.\n",

        "Abstract":"The efficacy and safety of levetiracetam (LEV), administered for management of levodopa-induced dyskinesias (LID) in Parkinson's disease (PD), was examined using a multicenter, double-blind, placebo-controlled, parallel groups, crossover trial. Because of having a period effect, data after crossover point was excluded from analysis. Levodopa-treated PD participants with LID (n = 38) received LEV 500 mg\/day, were assessed, titrated to 1,000 mg\/day and reassessed, before and after crossover. The placebo group followed the same routine. Primary efficacy was defined from percent change in \"On with LID\" time from patient diaries. Secondary efficacy assessment used \"On without LID,\" \"Off\" time, unified PD rating scale (UPDRS), clinical global impression (CGI), and Goetz dyskinesia scale after levodopa challenge. Safety measures were also performed. On with LID time decreased 37 minutes (95% confidence interval [CI] 0.59, 7.15; P = 0.02) at 500 mg\/day, 7.85% 75 minutes (95% CI 3.3, 12.4; P = 0.002) at 1,000 mg\/day. On without LID time increased by 46 minutes (95% CI -1.55, -0.03; P = 0.04) at 500 mg\/day and 55 minutes (95% CI -10.39, -1.14; P = 0.018) at 1,000 mg\/day. UPDRS 32 showed decreased dyskinesia duration mean change 0.35 (95% CI 0.09, 0.5; P = 0.009) at 1,000 mg\/day. CGI showed LID decreased by 0.7 (95% CI 0.21, 1.18; P = 0.006) at 1,000 mg\/day. Patient diaries and UPDRS show no increase in Off time. This exploratory trial provides evidence that LEV in 1,000 mg\/day, slowly titrated, could be useful in improving LID as was assessed with patient diaries, UPDRS, and CGI scales, safely, with minimal side effects.

        "Title":"Therapeutic interventions for disease progression in Huntington's disease",
        "Abstract":"BACKGROUND: Huntington's disease (HD) is an autosomal dominant neurodegenerative disease with an average onset between the fourth and fifth decade of life; it leads to death 15 to 20 years after the onset of symptoms. Although several drugs seem effective in controlling the incapacitating manifestations of HD, no specific therapy is known. The present review aims at analysing the best available data on therapeutic interventions investigated with the goal of modifying the progression of the disease as measured in terms of survival, disability or progression of HD core symptoms.\nOBJECTIVES: Evaluate the effectiveness of therapeutic interventions aimed at modifying disease progression in HD.\nSEARCH STRATEGY: The search strategy developed for the Movement Disorders Group was undertaken. The Cochrane Controlled Trials Register, Medline, EMBASE and Clinical Trials Database of the United States National Institute of Health were thoroughly searched until December 2007.\nSELECTION CRITERIA: All randomised, double-blinded, placebo-controlled clinical trials of therapeutics investigated with the goal of modifying disease progression in HD were included. Participants should have genetically confirmed diagnosis of HD or compatible symptoms and a family history. Trials had a follow-up duration of more than three months and at least ten participants. All pharmacological and non-pharmacological interventions were included.\nDATA COLLECTION AND ANALYSIS: Two reviewers independently assessed the eligibility of identified trials. The methodological quality was assessed and eligible data were registered onto standardised forms. An intention-to-treat analysis was conducted, when feasible. If data were not available in the original publication, the principal investigator of the trial was contacted for further information. A meta-analysis was to be conducted when possible; otherwise, a descriptive summary of the results was provided. The software Revman 5.0.15 was used for statistical analysis.\nMAIN RESULTS: Eight trials were included involving a total of 1366 HD patients. The duration of the studies ranged between 30 and 144 weeks (median: 52 weeks). The following interventions were selected: vitamin E, Idebenone, Baclofen, Lamotrigine, creatine, coenzyme Q10 + Remacemide, ethyl-eicosapentanoic acid and Riluzole. No trials produced positive results for the selected efficacy outcome measures. A descriptive summary of the trials is provided. The selected interventions were found to be generally safe and well tolerated.\nAUTHORS' CONCLUSIONS: Only pharmacological interventions were included and none proved to be effective as a disease-modifying therapy for HD. Further trials with greater methodological quality should be conducted using more sensitive biological markers. Pre-symptomatic mutation carriers should be included in future studies.
