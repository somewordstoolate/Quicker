        "Abstract":"In order to determine the factors associated with good and poor 1-year prognosis of demented patients, the caretakers of 100 home-based patients attending a specialist memory clinic were interviewed. After the follow-up, 71% continued to live at home. Mild dementia, independence in activities of daily living, fair independence in functions of instrumental activities of daily living, and lack of depression were clear signs for a good prognosis. Some patients with severe dementia and poor functional capacity continued to live at home. Continuing home care was also more likely if memory impairment, as opposed to functional problems, was expressed as the main concern. The proportion of caretakers mentioning memory decline as the main problem decreased during 1 year from 38% to 9% and the proportion mentioning functional problems increased from 48% to 64% among those continuing in home care. Memory disturbances are the first to appear and cause problems, but only functional decline threatens living at home.\n",

        "Abstract":"OBJECTIVES: To compare the 4-year survival, institutionalization, cognitive and functional decline of Alzheimer's patients with specific follow-up in memory centers versus usual care.\nDESIGN: Four year longitudinal follow-up.\nSETTINGS: The French Network of memory centers in Alzheimer's disease (REAL-FR study) and The French population-based study (3C study).\nPARTICIPANTS: 728 patients aged >= 65, living at home, meeting criteria for probable Alzheimer's disease and having Mini Mental State Examination (MMSE) scores between 10 and 26 at baseline were included.\nMEASUREMENTS: Cox proportional hazards models were performed to test the effectiveness of a specific follow-up in memory centers (REAL-FR study) versus usual care (3C study) on the 4-year survival and institutionalization. Linear mixed models were used to assess cognitive and functional decline in both groups.\nRESULTS: After adjustment for confounding factors, the 4-year survival did not differ significantly between patients followed-up in memory centers and those who had recourse to usual care (usual care: Hazard Ratio adjusted (HRa) = 0.87, 95% confidence interval (CI) 0.53-1.43, p=0.59). Patients with a specific follow-up in memory centers had a higher risk of being institutionalized (usual care: HRa = 0.24, 95% CI 0.12-0.48, p<0.001). They also exhibited a significant greater cognitive and functional decline over time.\nCONCLUSION: Our findings failed to demonstrate any potential benefits of a specific follow-up in memory centers on clinically meaningful outcomes in the natural history of Alzheimer's disease. Recourse to care in memory centers may have been the consequence of a faster dementia progression and a greater burden of Alzheimer's disease, all leading to detrimental consequences on various prognostic outcomes.

        "Abstract":"OBJECTIVES: To compare nurse initial diagnoses following domiciliary visits with subsequent formal multidisciplinary formulation based upon the full possession of investigations, neuropsychological tests and brain imaging.\nDESIGN: Retrospective case note study.\nSETTING: Home-based nurse assessments, secondary care based multidisciplinary memory clinic.\nPARTICIPANTS: Four hundred and four consecutive referrals over an 18-month period.\nRESULTS: One hundred and seventy-five patients (43.3%) were diagnosed by the multi-disciplinary team as having a dementia. Seventy-three (41.5%) were classified as Alzheimer's disease, 81 (46%) of mixed sub-type and 20 (11.4%) of vascular origin. Overall nurse-MDT diagnosis agreement was 0.88 (Kappa = 0.82). Together, two nurses were able to detect dementia with 94% accuracy (Kappa = 0.88) Sensitivity was 92% and specificity 96%. The positive and negative predictive values of their judgements were 94% and 98% respectively. Nurses were able to sub-diagnose dementia with 86% (kappa = 0.76) accuracy. Multivariate logistic regression modelling showed a MDT dementia diagnosis to be independently and significantly associated with lower scores on the KOLT and total MMSE, and with the absence of biological markers of depression. Nurse dementia diagnoses were associated with lower KOLT scores and the absence of biological depression markers, high past alcohol consumption or a history of hypercholesteraemia.\nCONCLUSIONS: In this study, structured initial assessment by a specialist nurse was shown to be an accurate method of determining a diagnosis of cognitive impairment, when compared with formal MDT judgement. The principal benefit of this approach was that signposting to subsequent care pathways was expedited. Arguably, such distributed responsibility affords a viable option for the future detection of early dementia.\n",

        "Abstract":"BACKGROUND: Increased concentrations of cerebrospinal fluid (CSF) total tau (t-tau) and phosphorylated tau, as well as decreased amyloid-beta 42 peptide, are biomarkers of Alzheimer's disease (AD) pathology, but few studies have shown an association with AD progression rate. We hypothesized that high CSF tau, as a marker of ongoing neurodegeneration, would predict a more aggressive course of AD, using time to nursing home placement (NHP) as the main outcome.\nMETHODS: Our sample inlcuded 234 patients with mild cognitive impairment (MCI) due to AD (n = 134) or mild to moderate AD (n = 100) who underwent lumbar puncture at a memory clinic and were followed for 2-11 years (median 4.9 years).\nRESULTS: Individuals with CSF t-tau in the highest quartile (>=900 ng\/L) had a higher ratio of NHP, both in the total cohort and in patients with MCI only (adjusted HR 2.17 [95% CI 1.24-3.80]; HR 2.37 [95% CI 1.10-5.09], respectively), than the lowest quartile. The association between high t-tau levels and future steep deterioration was confirmed in analyses with conversion to moderate dementia (HR 1.66; 95% CI 1.08-2.56), rapid decline in Mini Mental State Examination score (>=4-point drop\/12 months), and dying in severe dementia as outcomes.\nCONCLUSIONS: To our knowledge, this is the first study to show that high CSF t-tau levels predict early NHP and conversion to moderate dementia in an AD cohort. Selecting patients with high CSF t-tau, indicating more aggressive neurodegeneration and steeper decline, for AD immunotherapy trials might increase the possibility of showing contrast between active treatment and placebo.\n",

Patients aged less than 65 years at the time of onset of symptom were included in the EOD group, whereas older patients were included in the late-onset dementia (LOD) group.\nRESULTS: Three thousand four hundred and seventy-three patients (including 1932 women) were included and 811 (23.4%) were classified as EOD. The sex ratio was 1.12, whereas women were overrepresented in LOD (P=0.001). Patients with EOD were more frequently (P=0.001) living at home (87.3%), they had a lower educational level than the general population (P=0.0001) but were more educated (P=0.001). The current Mini Mental State Examination did not differ (P=0.3) between EOD (18.6+\/-7.6) and LOD (18.9+\/-6). The most common causes of EOD were Alzheimer's (22.3%) and vascular (15.9%) diseases and 4 pathologies that were significantly more frequent (P=0.001) than in the LOD group: frontotemporal dementia (9.7%), alcohol-related dementia (9.4%), traumatic brain injury (3.8%), and Huntington's disease (3%).\nCONCLUSIONS: EOD is characterized by specific features and different causes although Alzheimer's and vascular dementias remain the main causes of dementia in EOD.\n",

Mild cognitive impairment of the vascular type (MCI-V) was defined based on modified criteria for subcortical vascular dementia (SVD) by Erkinjuntti and colleagues. Twenty-nine patients with MCI-V (age 78 +\/- 7, Mini Mental State Exam (MMSE) 24 +\/- 3) were compared with 14 with mild cognitive impairment of degenerative etiology (MCI) based on the Mayo Clinic criteria (age 72 +\/- 9, MMSE 25 +\/- 2), and to 21 patients with frank SVD (age 80 +\/- 6, MMSE 21 +\/- 3). Patients were followed over time for 32 +\/- 8 months.\nRESULTS: MCI-V patients had a neuropsychological profile characterized by poor performance on frontal tests (Wisconsin card sorting and word fluency) and neurological features of parkinsonism without tremor (impairment of balance and gait). Of those followed for at least 40 months, 50 % of patients with MCI-V and SVD had died, while all MCI patients were still alive ( P = 0.03). Of those alive, 68 % of the MCI-V, 52 % of the SVD, and 17 % of the MCI patients had reached one of the following outcomes at 40 months: nursing home placement, functional loss, and cognitive deterioration ( P = 0.02).\nCONCLUSIONS: Patients with MCI-V have a distinctive clinical picture and can be identified in a clinical setting. Because of the high frequency of adverse outcomes, very early preventive measures need to be devised.\n",

        "Abstract":"BACKGROUND: Drugs with anticholinergic properties may be associated with various adverse clinical effects. The relationship between the anticholinergic (AC) burden and functional, global cognitive performance and behavior disturbances was assessed among elderly patients.\nMETHODS: A cross-sectional study was conducted between January 2012 and June 2014 in a memory clinic among outpatients living at home and with subjective cognitive decline (SCD) or neurocognitive disorders (NCD). The AC burden was measured using the Anticholinergic Drug Scale (ADS), the Anticholinergic Risk Scale (ARS), the Anticholinergic Cognitive Burden (ACB), Chew's score, Han's score, and the number of drugs with AC activity. Functional, cognitive performance and behavior disturbances were assessed using the Instrumental Activities of Daily Living (IADL) scale (IADL), the Mini Mental State Examination (MMSE), and the Neuropsychiatric Inventory (NPI).\nRESULTS: Among 473 included patients, 46.3% were at major NCD. Patients took on average 5.3 +\/- 2.6 drugs. MMSE was lower when Han's score (p = 0.04) and number of AC drugs were higher (p < 0.001). IADL was lower when AC burden was higher, whatever the AC measurement. NPI was higher when ACB, Han's score, and number of AC drugs were higher. After adjustment, all AC scores remained associated with IADL, while Han's score and number of drugs with AC remained associated with the MMSE.\nCONCLUSIONS: In patients with SCD or NCD, AC burden is associated with lower functional score, whereas the cross-sectional association between AC burden and cognitive performance or behavioral disturbance varies according to AC scores. Particular attention should be paid when prescribing drugs with AC properties, especially among patients with memory complaints.\n",

Could the role of the specialist clinician be supported by other health professionals screening those who might benefit from treatment?\nMETHOD: Sixty-four consecutive referrals to the Leicester University Memory Clinic were assessed at home by a community psychiatric nurse using a semi-structured interview. The nurse then reported her findings to a psychiatrist and a diagnosis was agreed. This diagnosis was then compared to the Memory Clinic diagnosis and a standardized (ICD-10) diagnosis recorded by another psychiatrist examining the clinic records.\nRESULTS: The nurse assessment procedure performed well in detecting dementia, with a kappa statistic (k) of 0.75 when compared to the standardized and Memory Clinic diagnoses. There was, however, only moderate concordance between the ICD-10 diagnosis and nurse (k = 0.46) and the Memory Clinic and nurse (k = 0.60) for Alzheimer's disease. The relatively low k value for Alzheimer's disease was principally a result of difficult in differentiating vascular dementia.\nCONCLUSIONS: A single supervised community psychiatric nurse, using a structured assessment instrument, can adequately detect early dementia in a sample of patients referred with memory problems. Subtypes of dementia are not, however, accurately differentiated.\n",

        "Abstract":"Parkinson's disease (PD) afflicts millions of people worldwide and leads to cognitive impairment or dementia in the majority of patients over time. Parkinson's disease dementia (PDD) is characterized by deficits in attention, executive and visuospatial function, and memory. The clinical diagnostic criteria and neuropathology surrounding PDD remain controversial with evidence of overlap among PDD, dementia with Lewy bodies (DLB) and Alzheimer's disease (AD). Cortical cholinergic deficits are greater in PDD than in AD, and are well-correlated with the cognitive and neuropsychiatric dysfunction that occurs in PDD. Inhibition of acetylcholine metabolism is therefore a practical therapeutic strategy in PDD. This review examines current evidence for rivastigmine (a cholinesterase\/butyrylcholinesterase inhibitor) treatment in PDD. In addition to its efficacy, we examine the safety profile, side effects, and cost effectiveness of rivastigmine in PDD. Rivastigmine provides modest benefit in PDD and further long-term studies are needed to determine the effectiveness and safety of rivastigmine over time. Tolerability is a problem for many PDD patients treated with rivastigmine. Future studies of rivastigmine in PDD should focus on pragmatic outcomes such as time to need for nursing home placement, pharmacoeconomic outcomes and simultaneous patient\/caregiver quality of life assessments.\n",

The interview measured performance on the decision-making abilities and three expert psychiatrists' judgment of competency based on their independent review of the patient interviews.\nRESULTS: There was considerable variation in patients' performance on the measures of decision-making abilities. Three expert raters found 19 of 48 (40%) of the subjects competent. Competent patients were more likely to show awareness of their symptoms, prognosis, and diagnosis.

We examined both formal and informal services (distinguished by whether money was exchanged) and associated expenditures.\nRESULTS: Neither caregivers returning diaries nor their patients differed at baseline from those not returning diaries and their patients. Expenditures incurred over 6 months were extensive for both formal ($6986) and informal ($786) services. Out-of-pocket expenditures were high (e.g., in-home companion or sitter, adult day care, visiting nurse). Multivariable analyses indicated that patients with more severe symptoms of dementia and families with higher incomes reported significantly higher expenditures.\nCONCLUSIONS: The expense of caring for patients with progressive dementia living at home may be higher than previously estimated and frequently involves expenses paid directly by patients and their families.\n",

There is, however, a widespread belief that ABPM could be poorly tolerated in dementia, often leading to withdraw from its use in these patients.\nAIM: To assess the actual tolerability of ABPM in a group of cognitively impaired elderly, affected by dementia or mild cognitive impairment (MCI).\nMETHODS: We evaluated 176 patients aged 65 + years, recruited in two different memory clinics, with a Mini Mental State Examination (MMSE) between 10 and 27. Behavioral and psychological symptoms were assessed with Neuropsychiatric Inventory (NPI). A patient was considered tolerant if able to keep the device on continuously for 24 h. The minimum number of correct measurements required was 70% of the predicted total number.\nRESULTS: 16% of patients wore the device for less than 24 h. Dividing the study population in tertiles of MMSE performance, 29% failed to tolerate the device in the lowest, 12% in the middle and 7% in the highest tertile (p < 0.01). Dividing the study population in tertiles of NPI performance, 30% of patients failed in the highest, 19% in the middle and 8% in the lowest tertile (p = 0.02); 31% of patients who tolerated the device did not achieve the minimum number of measurements required, with a mean number of 63% of predicted measurements.\nCONCLUSION: The ABPM proved a generally well-tolerated technique even in cognitively impaired elderly. Only a minority of subjects with poorer cognitive performances and greater behavioral symptoms did not tolerate the monitoring. Among most patients who failed to achieve the minimum number of measurements needed, the number of valid measurements was very close to the minimum required.\n",

        "Abstract":"OBJECTIVES: Behavioral and psychological symptoms of dementia (BPSD) are prevalent in Alzheimer disease (AD) and are related to poor outcomes such as nursing home placement. No study has examined the impact of individual BPSD on dependence, a clinically important feature that reflects changing patient needs and their effect on caregivers. The current study characterized independent cross-sectional and longitudinal relationships between three BPSD (psychosis, depressed mood, and agitation\/aggression), cognition, and dependence to better understand the interplay between these symptoms over time.\nDESIGN: The Predictors Study measured changes in BPSD, cognition, and dependence every 6 months in patients with AD. Cross-sectional and longitudinal relationships between individual BPSD, cognition, and dependence over 6 years were characterized by using multivariate latent growth curve modeling. This approach characterizes independent changes in multiple outcome measures over time.\nSETTING: Four memory clinics in the United States and Europe.\nPARTICIPANTS: A total of 517 patients with probable AD.\nMEASUREMENTS: Columbia University Scale for Psychopathology, modified Mini-Mental State Examination, and Dependence Scale.\nRESULTS: Both psychosis and depressed mood at study entry were associated with worse subsequent cognitive decline. Independent of cognitive decline, initial psychosis was associated with worse subsequent increases in dependence. Rates of increase in agitation\/aggression separately correlated with rates of declines in both cognition and independence.\nCONCLUSIONS: Although purely observational, our findings support the poor prognosis associated with psychosis and depression in AD. Results also show that agitation\/aggression tracks declines in cognition and independence independently over time. Targeted intervention for individual BPSD, particularly psychosis, could have broad effects not only on patient well-being but also on care costs and family burden.

        "Abstract":"OBJECTIVE: To identify minimal sets of Mini-Mental State Examination (MMSE) items that can distinguish normal control subjects from patients with mild Alzheimer's disease (AD), patients with mild from those with moderate AD, and those with moderate from those with severe AD.\nDESIGN: Two randomly selected equivalent half samples. Results of logistic regression analysis from data from the first half of the sample were confirmed by receiver operating characteristic curves on the second half.\nSETTING: Memory disorders clinics at major medical centers in the United States affiliated with the Consortium to establish a Registry for Alzheimer's Disease (CERAD).\nPARTICIPANTS: White, normal control subjects (n = 412) and patients with AD (n = 621) who met CERAD criteria; nonwhite subjects (n = 165) and persons with missing data (n = 27) were excluded.\nMAIN OUTCOME MEASURES: Three four-item sets of MMSE items that discriminate, respectively, (1) normal controls from patients with mild AD, (2) patients with mild from those with moderate AD, and (3) patients with moderate from those with severe AD.\nRESULTS: The MMSE items discriminating normal controls from patients with mild AD were day, date, recall of apple, and recall of penny; those discriminating patients with mild from those with moderate AD were month, city, spelling world backward, and county, and those discriminating patients with moderate from those with severe AD were floor of building, repeating the word table, naming watch, and folding paper in half. Performance on the first two four-item sets was comparable with that of the full MMSE; the third set distinguished patients with moderate from those with severe AD better than chance.\nCONCLUSIONS: A minimum set of MMSE items can effectively discriminate normal controls from patients with mild AD and between successive levels of severity of AD. Data apply only to white patients with AD. Performance in minorities, more heterogeneous groups, or normal subjects with questionable cognitive status has not been assessed.\n",

        "Abstract":"In this article we present an inventory of the moral intuitions of the health care workers who work in the field of early detection of dementia. The effects of pharmacological treatment and professional care and support may improve when dementia is detected in an early stage. Furthermore, the patient (and his family) can prepare themselves for the period to come. Health care workers recognize moral problems and tensions concerning early detection that are related to the question whether persons will benefit from knowledge in an earlier stage of dementia, because this knowledge can be a heavy burden. We asked general practitioners, home care workers, employees of the so-called 'Memory clinic' and specialists, what ethical intuitions they recognize in practice. They mentioned the following questions: when are health care professionals allowed to take initiative, is causing worries and concerns problematic, and should a diagnosis always to be told? We conclude after a first analysis that many moral questions derive from the fact that many health care professionals lack knowledge of the wishes and interests of the elderly. At the same time they try to justify their actions on the (presupposed) consent of the elderly person. We suggest that the general norm 'only act when the patient wants to be helped' in health care should also apply to detection of dementia, although it should not be taken too strictly. Another justification for early detection can be found in the benefits for the elderly people, when their wishes are no longer expressed.\n",

At the Memory Clinic at CSK, Kristianstad, we have observed over 40 patients with cognitive decline and diabetes type I and II. Cognitive dysfunction seems to affect both compliance and the glucose levels. In collaboration with the diabetes unit at the Medicine Clinic, CSK, guidelines have been developed to aid early discovery of cognitive decline and adapted interventions aiming for optimal independence at home and at work. The possibility of these individually adapted interventions aiding in slowing down the rate of complications as well as the secondary risk of dementia is under observation.\n",

        "Abstract":"INTRODUCTION: The National Institute for Health and Clinical Excellence (NICE) in the United Kingdom, the Institut fur Qualitat und Wirtschaftlichkeit im Gesundheitswesen (IQWIG) in Germany and the Haute Autorite de Sante (HAS) in France have recently set out guidelines on prescription of anti-dementia medication. The HAS proposes in particular that continuation of these drugs for longer than one year should be decided in multidisciplinary team meetings (MDTM).\nOBJECTIVE: To assess the feasibility of MDTM and the satisfaction of coordinating physicians from institutions for the dependent elderly (nursing home, NH) and expert physicians from memory clinics who have participated in the meetings.\nMETHODS: Survey carried out among physicians who had participated in the MDTM held as part of the IDEM study (Interest of systematic tracking of dementia cases in NH: analysing the contribution of MDTM in Alzheimer's disease and related diseases; PHRC National 2009, Code 0910701). The survey evaluated the organization of MDTM and the physicians' opinion of these meetings.\nRESULTS: The cases of 574 patients were discussed in MDTM involving 133 healthcare professionals (32 coordinating physicians, 48 expert physicians, 4 general practitioners and 49 other health professionals). The mean number of participants was 4.2+\/-1.6. About 16 minutes were spent discussing the case of each resident. About 90% of physicians considered that the meetings were useful. Overall assessment of their efficacy was 11.5\/20 for the coordinating physicians and 14.1\/20 for the expert physicians. The benefits of MDTM in relation to the work entailed were considered important by 60% of expert physicians and 33% of coordinating physicians.\nCONCLUSIONS: Our survey confirmed the feasibility of MDTM in the field of Alzheimer's disease. The overall benefit\/workload ratio of the meetings was considered to be favorable for the expert physicians. The benefits of MDTM were turned out to be less appreciated by the coordinating physicians according to high workload involved.\n",

The purpose of this study was to assess the prevalence of MD in different types of dementia, correlate the presence of MD with demographic and clinical variables, and validate a specific questionnaire. We examined 146 subjects with Alzheimer disease, 21 with Lewy body dementia, 6 with frontotemporal dementia, and 13 with vascular dementia (subcortical type), who were consecutively enrolled in the study from 2 Memory Clinics. Patients had a mean age of 78.7+\/-6.4 years and an Mini-Mental State Examination average score of 16.9+\/-6.1. The Neuropsychiatric Inventory delusion subscale and a new Misidentification Delusion Questionnaire aimed at specific assessment of 11 delusional misidentification syndromes were administrated to the caregivers. On the basis of the Neuropsychiatric Inventory, MDs were present in 33.3% of the subjects, whereas according to the Misidentification Delusion Questionnaire they were present in 36.0% of the subjects. Specifically, 34.2% of Alzheimer disease, 52.4% of Lewy body dementia, and 46.1% of vascular dementia patients experienced at least 1 MD. None of the patients with frontotemporal dementia developed MD. The most frequent MD was house misidentification, followed by splitting of people and reduplicative paramnesia. Our self-administered questionnaire proved to be an accurate and specific tool for the detection of MD.\n",

        "Abstract":"BACKGROUND: Subjective memory impairment (SMI) refers to subjective awareness of initial memory decline undetectable with existing standardized cognitive tests. The Face Name Associative Memory Exam (FNAME) was created to detect memory deficits in individuals with preclinical Alzheimer's disease (AD). We reported normative data of a Spanish version of FNAME (S-FNAME) in cognitively normal (CN) Spanish-speaking subjects >49.\nOBJECTIVE: To determine whether higher SMI [a modification of Memory Failures Everyday (MFE-30)] was related to worse memory performance (S-FNAME) or associated with greater affective symptoms in subjects >49; and whether MFE-30 and FNAME were able to discriminate between CN and mild cognitive impairment (MCI) subjects.\nMETHODS: 317 subjects (CN = 196, MCI = 121) were included in the analysis because they attended the annual \"Open House Initiative\" at Memory Clinic Fundacio ACE, were >49 years, literate, received S-FNAME, MFE-30, and Hospital Anxiety and Depression Scale, had Mini-Mental State Examination scores >=27, and returned to complete a comprehensive diagnostic assessment.\nRESULTS: MFE-30 scores were associated with affective symptoms but not with S-FNAME performance. S-FNAME scores were related to performance on memory variables of NBACE (neuropsychological battery used in Fundacio ACE). Although the MCI group showed significantly higher MFE-30 and worse S-FNAME scores than the CN group, their discriminability values were similar (Sensitivity: 49.6 versus 52.9; Specificity: 85.1 versus 83.6, respectively).\nCONCLUSIONS: SMI was more related to depressive symptoms than to S-FNAME memory performance; and S-FNAME scores were related to other episodic memory test performances, but neither to affective symptoms nor to SMI. MFE-30 and S-FNAME are not optimal for discriminating between CN and MCI groups. Longitudinal follow-up will determine if lower S-FNAME and higher SMI are related to increased risk of AD.\n",

A total of 104 patients with dementia and their primary caregivers were recruited from the geriatric, neurology, and memory clinics of a regional hospital, a medical center and two day-care centers in central Taiwan. The data related to hyperphagic behavior, functional abilities, medical conditions, body weight, and demographic characteristics of patients as well as the demographic characteristics of their primary caregivers were collected between January and May 2013.\nRESULTS: Based on a strict criterion (a median score of 3 for the hyperphagic subscale), the prevalence of hyperphagia in patients with dementia was 53.8%. Specific hyperphagic patterns exhibited included increased food intake (49% of patients with dementia), hoarding (8.7%), oral exploration (6.8%), and pica (3.9%). Years of education of the patient, the use of antipsychotics in patients, and the age of primary caregivers explained 16.3% of the variance in hyperphagic behavior subscale scores (F = 6.47, p < .001).\nCONCLUSIONS: For the early identification and treatment of hyperphagic behavior in patients with dementia in home care or in clinic services provided by health professionals, specific attention should be paid to the usual eating behaviors of patients with lower levels of education or who are taking antipsychotic medication or those who have a female primary caregiver.

Considering the increasing societal relevance of dementia, memory clinics will most likely gain in importance in the future.\nMATERIAL AND METHODS: Addresses of German memory clinics were obtained by an online search. All institutions were surveyed via questionnaire with items regarding structural characteristics (designation, affiliation, services offered, funding) and quality features (waiting times, disease severity at diagnosis).\nRESULTS: The results of the inquiry of all institutions (n=153, response: 48%) show memory clinics as specialised institutions that have a low degree of standardisation, but basically have a high structural quality for diagnostic and therapeutic care.\nCONCLUSION: The development of homogeneous structure and process standards could help to establish memory clinics in regular care and to establish sustainable funding. In order to achieve this, an even more intensive collaboration and consensus building of all German memory clinics would be needed as well as a coordinated representation of interests.\n",

Functional status was evaluated through informant report using the clinical dementia rating (CDR) scale.\nMETHODS: Archival data were reviewed from records of 99 patients in a memory disorder clinic (MDC) research database. Consensus-based diagnoses were Alzheimer's disease (AD; n = 48), mild cognitive impairment (MCI; n = 48), AD with vascular components; (n = 2) and dementia due to psychiatric conditions (n = 1).\nRESULTS: The RBANS language index score was significantly related to CDR domain scores of community affairs (p < .01), home and hobbies (p < .01), personal care (p < .05), memory (p < 0.01), and judgment (p < 0.01). RBANS immediate memory index scores were significantly related to (p < 0.05) the CDR Memory and judgment and problem solving domains. Based on these findings, follow-up regressions were conducted. Semantic fluency was significantly related to CDR memory (p < 0.01), judgment (p < 0.05), community affairs (p < 0.05), home\/hobbies (p < 0.05), and personal care (p < 0.05) functional domains. Picture naming was significantly related to the CDR personal care domain (p < 0.05). List learning was significantly related to CDR memory functional domain (p < 0.01) and judgment (p < 0.05). Lastly, story memory was significantly related to the CDR judgment domain (p < 0.05).\nCONCLUSIONS: The RBANS may be an indicator of functional impairment as well as a neuropsychological testing tool. The use of the RBANS could reduce the amount of testing that is administered to the patient, or can provide a way to compare other measurements of functional impairment to assess accuracy of findings.\n",

        "Abstract":"OBJECTIVE: To estimate the burden of Alzheimer's disease (AD, including 'mixed' dementia) in New Zealand in 2006, and project this burden out to 2031.\nMETHOD: An incidence to prevalence methodology was utilized, the foundation of which is a discrete time Markov model allowing for multiple stages of disease (early vs late). Population estimates and projections, and all-cause mortality rates, were obtained from Statistics New Zealand. In the absence of usable New Zealand data, data on disease incidence and progression were obtained from systematic reviews of the international (mainly European, Australian and North American) literature. Projection scenarios included a demographic scenario in which change resulted only from increases in population size and ageing; a prevention scenario in which incidence rates were reduced by 25% from 2011; a treatment scenario in which disease progression rates were likewise reduced by 25% from 2011; and a combined scenario capturing both interventions.\nRESULTS: The model estimated that approximately 28000 people are currently living with AD (whether formally diagnosed or not), approximately 55% in the early and 45% in the late stage of the disease; approximately 6600 people newly develop AD each year; and approximately 2300 people die from (as opposed to with) this condition. The model projected that the prevalence of AD will increase approximately 2.5-fold (to approx. 70,000 people) by 2031, if demographic drivers are unopposed. Plausible improvements in prevention and treatment, however, acting together, could reduce this growth by up to 50%, so that the prevalence of AD only doubles.\nCONCLUSION: Even this more optimistic projection has profound implications for the funding and provision of dementia care services, as well as for patients, their families, informal carers and the psychogeriatric workforce. New service configurations and models of care will be necessary. Access, quality and coordination standards for home care, day care, respite care, residential care and specialist services (including memory clinics) will need to respond accordingly.\n",

This pilot study assessed the feasibility of conducting a study of moderate-to-high intensity aerobic exercise in home-dwelling patients with mild AD.\nMETHODS: An uncontrolled preintervention-postintervention test design with a single group receiving the same intervention. A total of eight patients with mild to moderate AD from the Copenhagen Memory clinic were included in the study. The intervention lasted for 14 weeks and consisted of supervised, 1-h sessions of aerobic exercise three times per week (50-60% of heart rate reserve for a two-week adaptation period and 70-80 % of heart rate reserve for the remaining 12 weeks) Feasibility was assessed based on acceptability, including attendance and drop-out, safety, and patients' and caregivers' attitudes towards the intervention as well as other relevant parameters.\nRESULTS: Attendance (mean, range: 90 %, 70-100 %) and retention (seven out of eight) rates were very high. No serious adverse events were observed. In general, patients and caregivers were positive towards the intervention.\nCONCLUSION: This study shows that it is feasible to conduct moderate-to-high intensity aerobic exercise in community-dwelling patients with mild AD. Our findings indicate that aspects such as a longer adaptation period, information about injury prevention, and need for involvement and support from caregivers should be addressed when planning an exercise intervention in an AD population.

The main outcome was time from symptom onset to institutionalization. Key predictors were cohort (YOD or LOD), neuropsychiatric symptoms, caregiver distress caused by neuropsychiatric symptoms, and caregivers' sense of competence (Short Sense of Competence Questionnaire total score).\nRESULTS: The time from symptom onset to institutionalization was nearly 9 years for patients with YOD compared with approximately 4 years for patients with LOD. In the YOD group, apathy significantly predicted time of institutionalization. Furthermore, the caregiver's competence in caring for the person with dementia significantly predicted institutionalization in both groups.\nCONCLUSIONS: Patients with YOD are cared for at home for a longer period than patients with LOD. The results of this study underline the importance of a timely diagnosis for these patients and their families to facilitate the initiation of appropriate care and support. Support programs aimed at enhancing the caregivers' sense of competence and ability to deal with neuropsychiatric symptoms, especially apathy, may postpone the institutionalization of the patient.

Relatively few studies specifically on safety risks have included older adults of color and tested interventions. This pilot study tested the feasibility and evaluability of educating Hispanic and African American caregivers of patients living with AD about reducing safety risks in their homes.\nMETHODS: This outpatient memory clinic-based intervention study included a pre-\/post-test survey design with two nonequivalent groups and predominately serves Hispanic and African Americans. Of 60 eligible caregivers, 67% participated in a tailored, safety training class with an optional follow-up call.\nRESULTS: The results indicate a reduction in some safety risks compared to baseline and\/or a no intervention group, respectively, including leaving patients at home alone part-time (p < .01 and p < .01), getting lost (p < .05 and p < .05), going outdoors alone less often (p < .05 and p < .01), and giving themselves medicine (p < .05 and p < .01). At post-test, 47 clinically significant instances occurred, in which caregivers who participated in the intervention self-reported patients living with AD to be 'completely safe' in one or more of the safety risk items compared to 8 instances among those who did not.\nCONCLUSIONS: This pilot pre\/post design with non-equivalent groups study needs refinement in a future randomized control trial. Despite limitations, this pilot study demonstrates the first feasible and evaluable intervention with both statistically and clinically significant results that suggest potential for reducing safety risks among at-risk minority patients living with AD in future research.\n",

        "Abstract":"Subjective cognitive decline (SCD) has been proposed as a marker of neurodegeneration in cognitively normal elderly. This idea is supported by the growing evidence that SCD is associated with Alzheimer's disease (AD) biomarkers and increases the risk of future cognitive impairment. Nevertheless, this evidence is not complete, since other studies have not found these associations. This discrepancy could have a methodological basis. It is well known that across the broad spectrum of degenerative disease from healthy controls to dementia, the research setting affects key characteristics of the sample such as age, educational level, or family history of dementia. However, virtually no studies have specifically tested the influence of sampling and recruitment methods in SCD research. Population-based samples are less biased and therefore they probably are more suitable for the study of memory complaints as a symptom at the population level. On the other hand, the memory clinic setting could introduce a set of biases that make these patients more likely to develop cognitive impairment. Thus, memory clinic would be the most cost-effective context in which to study the phenomenology of SCD due to AD and eventually recruit patients for secondary prevention trials. However, this general hypothesis needs to be tested. Studies that compare samples of patients with SCD from different settings are necessary. Sometimes it is difficult for patients with subtle forms of cognitive impairment to access specialized diagnostic centers. Based in our experience we state that Open House type initiatives may be useful for attracting these individuals to memory clinics.\n",

        "Abstract":"Memory clinics have been promoted as opportunities for improving dementia diagnosis and care. This article describes the implementation of an interdisciplinary memory clinic within primary care in Ontario, Canada, that aims to provide timely access to comprehensive assessment and care and to improve referring physicians' knowledge of the management of dementia through collaborative care and practice-based mentorship. Between July 2006 and September 2009, 246 initial and follow-up assessments were conducted with 151 patients, a high proportion of whom received a new diagnosis of mild cognitive impairment (44.4%) or dementia (19.2%). A trial of cholinesterase inhibitors was recommended for almost all patients newly diagnosed with dementia. Management interventions and recommendations included social worker outreach, long-term care planning, home safety or driving assessments, referral to community resources, and periodic follow-up and monitoring. A small proportion of patients (7.8%) were referred to a specialist. Surveyed patients and caregivers were very satisfied with their visit to the clinic. A chart audit conducted by two independent geriatricians indicated agreement with diagnosis and intervention, particularly related to use of specialists. The results indicate that memory clinics within primary care settings can support capacity building to ensure quality assessment and management of dementia at a primary care level.

        "Abstract":"This study assessed the information provided in a memory clinic and the patient and caregiver factors that influenced the provision of information. The study was part of a larger cross-sectional study of the diagnosis of dementia and satisfaction with information given. The participants were 51 elderly patients suspected of having dementia and living at home together with their caregivers. The main outcome measures were the checklist of information communicated to the patients and caregivers, patients' behavioural problems, patients' instrumental activities of daily living (IADL) problems, and caregivers' sense of competence. The results indicate that basic information about the diagnosis was given to 86% of patients and 88% of caregivers. Specific information about patients' behaviour and professional care was more often given when patients had more cognitive, behavioural, or IADL problems and caregivers had a lower sense of competence. Providing the majority of patients with information is feasible. These results contribute to an explanation of previous findings indicating that caregivers of patients with cognitive problems not related to dementia were less satisfied with the information they received. Adequate information should not only include issues considered relevant by clinicians but should also be tailored to the information needs of patients and caregivers.\n",

        "Abstract":"BACKGROUND AND PURPOSE: Preventing behavioural crises appears to be crucial to promote quality of life of the patient-caregiver dyad, to reduce inappropriate hospitalizations and to delay institutionalization. The Alzheimer Cooperative Valuation in Europe promotes mobile care to prevent patients from severe behavioural and psychological symptoms in dementia. This study assessed the potential efficacy of a mobile team for Alzheimer's disease on hospitalization sparing and behavioural disorder reduction.\nMETHODS: A cohort study was set up from 1 January 2012 to 31 December 2013 by the Clinical and Research Memory Centre of Lyon (France). It included patients with behavioural and psychological symptoms living at home or in a nursing home. An interview explored the alternative patient pathways used by general practitioners (GPs) if the mobile team had not existed (hospitalization sparing). The Neuropsychiatry Inventory score was assessed at inclusion and 30 days later. The sample included 424 consecutive patients with Alzheimer's disease or related disorders and behavioural disorders at any cognitive and functional stage of the disease, taken in charge by the mobile team.\nRESULTS: Amongst the 424 patients (84.0 +\/- 7.2 years), 220 (51.9%) hospitalizations were considered by their GPs and 181 (82.3%) were avoided. The Neuropsychiatric Inventory score declined after mobile team intervention (45.8-29.9, P < 0.001). Sleep and appetite disorders, endangered situation and caregiver burnout were associated with higher risk of hospitalization at 30 days.\nCONCLUSIONS: The mobile team for Alzheimer's disease allows a high proportion of hospitalizations related to behavioural disorders to be avoided and may help to reduce behavioural disorders.

        "Abstract":"BACKGROUND: Service planning for people with younger onset dementia (YOD; an onset of symptoms before the age of 65 years) relies on prevalence estimates, with existing models based upon older people. This pilot study investigated the prevalence and causes of YOD in a defined catchment area of Eastern Sydney, Australia.\nMETHODS: The study was conducted in three stages: publicity building, case finding, and case validation. A brief structured questionnaire was sent to health professionals in the catchment area asking how many patients with YOD they had seen over the previous 12 months. Memory clinics and hospital records were also searched for YOD patients. Clinicians assigned a Statistical Linkage Key to each patient to prevent double counting, and indicated the cause of dementia. The majority of patients were validated by a review of medical case notes. Prevalence data were calculated for the following age groups: 30-64, 30-44, and 45-64 years.\nRESULTS: Two hundred and four potential patients were identified, of which 141 met inclusion criteria. The primary clinical subtypes were alcohol-related dementia (18.4%), Alzheimer's disease (17.7%), vascular dementia (12.8%), and frontotemporal dementia (11.3%). Eighty-eight patients were aged 30 to 64 years on census date and were therefore included in the prevalence calculations. The overall prevalence was 68.2 per 100,000 population at risk for the 30-64-year age group (95% Confidence Interval (CI): 54.9-83.4); 11.6 per 100,000 for the 30-44-year age group (95% CI: 5.3-21.7); and 132.9 per 100,000 for the 45-64 age group (95% CI: 105.8-164.2).\nCONCLUSIONS: Younger onset dementia affects a significant number of people in Eastern Sydney with a diverse range of clinical types. This prevalence rate is higher than previous reports from the United Kingdom and Japan, with a different distribution of etiologies, which have important implications for service planning for this group.\n",

        "Abstract":"PURPOSE: The proposed dementia precursor state of mild cognitive impairment is emerging as a primary target of aging research. Yet, little is known about the subjective experience of living with a diagnosis of mild cognitive impairment. This study examines, from the patient's perspective, the experience of living with and making sense of the diagnosis.\nDESIGN AND METHODS: We recruited 12 older adults with amnestic or nonamnestic mild cognitive impairment from a university-based memory disorders clinic. We conducted in-home, semistructured interviews in order to elicit rich descriptions of the personal experience of having mild cognitive impairment. We used the qualitative method of grounded theory to analyze narrative data.\nRESULTS: Understanding and coming to terms with the syndrome, or assigning meaning, constituted a fundamental aspect of living with a diagnosis of mild cognitive impairment. This process comprised interrelated emotional and cognitive dimensions. Participants employed a range of positive, neutral, and negative phrasing in order to depict their emotional reactions to receiving a diagnosis. Cognitive representations of mild cognitive impairment included both prognosis-focused and face-value appraisals. Expectations of normal aging, personal experience with dementia, and concurrent health problems were key contextual factors that provided the backdrop against which participants assigned meaning to a diagnosis of mild cognitive impairment.\nIMPLICATIONS: Clinicians who disclose diagnoses of mild cognitive impairment need to be mindful of the potential for varying interpretations of the information that is conveyed. Future research needs to include systematic, longitudinal investigations of illness representation and its impact on health behaviors among individuals with mild cognitive impairment.\n",

        "Abstract":"We compared data regarding diagnosis, treatment and follow-up of patients with dementia in the central and the peripheral areas of Israel. Data were collected from the medical records of 164 patients with advanced dementia, all residents of dementia special care units - 97 patients from a central nursing home and 67 patients from the peripheral areas. The data collected related to the period prior to hospitalization and included: demographic data, imaging tests, follow-up by a memory clinic and drug treatment prior to admission. Mini Mental State Examination on admission was also recorded. Patients in the peripheral areas were hospitalized while having better cognitive function, as demonstrated by the Mini Mental State Examination (p < 0.05). More patients in the central areas versus the peripheral areas were aided by an in-house worker prior to admission (p < 0.001). More patients with dementia in the central areas were followed up by a memory clinic (p < 0.001) and underwent brain imaging (p < 0.01) compared with patients with dementia living in the peripheral areas. Although not significant, patients from the central areas were more commonly treated with atypical neuroleptics for behavioral problems (p = 0.05). On the basis of the current data, we suggest that there are differences in the diagnosis, follow-up and drug treatment among patients with dementia living in the central areas versus those living in the peripheral ones. Patients in the peripheral areas are hospitalized while their cognitive abilities are relatively better than those of the patients in central areas. Copyright Â© The Author(s) 2013.\n",

Seventeen (17%) of the caregivers did not want their relative to take a risk-free medicine that could slow AD. Half (n=52) did not want their relative to take an AD-slowing medicine that had a 3% annual risk of gastrointestinal bleeding. Caregivers who were more likely to forgo risk-free treatment of AD were older (odds ratio (OR)=1.7, P=.04), were depressed (OR=3.66, P=.03), had relatives living in a nursing home (OR=3.6, P=.02), had relatives with more-severe dementia according to the Mini-Mental State Examination (MMSE) (OR=2.29, P=.03) or Dementia Severity Rating Scale (DSRS) (OR=2.55, P=.002), and rated their relatives' quality of life (QOL) poorly on a single-item global rating (OR=0.25, P=.001) and the 13-item quality-of-life (QOL)-AD scale (OR=0.38, P=.002). Caregivers who were more likely to forgo a risky treatment were nonwhite (OR=6.53, P=.005), had financial burden (OR=2.93, P=.02), and rated their relative's QOL poorly on a single-item global rating (OR=0.61, P=.01) and the QOL-AD (OR=0.56, P=.01).\nCONCLUSION: These results suggest that caregivers are generally willing to slow the progression of their relative's dementia even into the severe stage of the disease, especially if it can be done without risk to the patient. Clinical trials and practice guidelines should recognize that a caregiver's assessment of patient QOL and the factors that influence it affect a caregiver's willingness to use AD-slowing treatments.\n",

        "Abstract":"Between 1991 and 1995, 334 persons from the city of Zurich have been investigated at the gerontologic counselling facility of the memory clinic of the nursing home Entlisberg near Zurich. 49 (14.7%) of these persons suffered from a treatable disease (16 from depression, 13 from chronic intoxication, 20 from other treatable diseases), 10 from other disturbances (debility or postapoplectic state), and 275 from dementia. In 45% of the cases dementia was moderate, in 47% moderate to severe, and in 8% severe. In most cases dementia was of Alzheimer's type (60.7%), others were of multi-infarct type (17.5%), of mixed type (13.1%), or other types (8.7%). Until march 1996, 64 (19.4%) of these 334 on the average 74-year-old persons treated in the memory clinic have been admitted to a city nursing home. They have compared to a random sample, including 312 demented persons of similar ages and similar date of admittance to the same institutions. The proportion of demented persons cared before admittance by a spouse was about 28% in both groups. On an average, the mini mental state (Zurich variant) at admittance to a nursing home was 10.95 points in patients from the memory clinic, compared to 13.43 points in the control group. Thus, patients that have formerly been advised and trained entered the nursing home in a state of dementia more advanced by 2.48 points. Based on an average yearly demelioration by about 2.4 points, this means admittance to a nursing home is delayed by 376 days. Patients for whom admittance to a nursing home could be avoided completely by the treatment proposed by the counselling were not considered in this calculation.\n",

The goal of this study is to report indices of sleep-wake function collected from individuals with AD in relation to relevant polymorphisms in circadian clock-related genes.\nDESIGN: One week of ad libitum ambulatory sleep data collection.\nSETTING: At-home collection of sleep data and in-laboratory questionnaire.\nPARTICIPANTS: Two cohorts of AD participants. Cohort 1 (N = 124): individuals with probable AD recruited from the Stanford\/Veterans Affairs, National Institute on Aging Alzheimer's Disease Core Center (N = 81), and the Memory Disorders Clinic at the University of Nice School of Medicine (N = 43). Cohort 2 (N = 176): individuals with probable AD derived from the Alzheimer's Disease Neuroimaging Initiative data set.\nMEASUREMENTS: Determination of sleep-wake state was obtained by wrist actigraphy data for 7 days in Cohort 1 and by the Neuropsychiatric Inventory questionnaire for Cohort 2. Both cohorts were genotyped by using an Illumina Beadstation (Illumina, San Diego, CA), and 122 circadian-related single-nucleotide polymorphisms (SNPs) were examined. In Cohort 1, an additional polymorphism (variable-number tandem repeat in per3) was also determined.\nRESULTS: Adjusting for multiple tests, none of the candidate gene SNPs were significantly associated with the amount of wake time after sleep onset (WASO), a marker of sleep consolidation. Although the study was powered sufficiently to identify moderate-sized correlations, we found no relationships likely to be of clinical relevance.\nCONCLUSIONS: It is unlikely that a relationship with a clinically meaningful correlation exists between the circadian rhythm-associated SNPs and WASO in individuals with AD.\n",

        "Abstract":"Pharmacists have developed innovative practices in various settings as singular providers or as members of multidisciplinary or interdisciplinary teams. Examples include pharmacists practicing in heart failure, hypertension, or hyperlipidemia clinics. There is a paucity of literature describing pharmacists in interdisciplinary memory clinics and specifically pharmacists practicing in interdisciplinary, primary care-based memory clinics. New practice models should be disseminated to guide others in the development of similar models given the complexity of this population. Patients with dementia are more difficult to manage because of cognitive impairment, behavioral and psychological symptoms, the common presence of multiple comorbidities, and related polypharmacy and caregiver issues. These challenges require expertise in neurodegenerative disorders and geriatrics. The purpose of this article is to describe the role of clinical pharmacists providing care to patients with cognitive complaints in a primary care-based, interdisciplinary memory clinic, with a focus on how the pharmacist practices and is integrated in this collaborative care setting. Patients are assessed using an interdisciplinary approach, with team consensus for assessment and planning of care. Pharmacists' activities include assessment of (1) appropriateness of medications based on frailty, (2) medications that can impair cognition and\/or function, (3) medication adherence and management skills, and (4) vascular risk factor control. Pharmacists provide education regarding medications and diseases, ensure appropriate transitions in care, and conduct home visits. Pharmacist participation in this clinic represents a novel opportunity to advance pharmacy practice in primary care, interdisciplinary models. Work is ongoing to describe outcomes attributable to pharmacist participation in this clinic.\n",

        "Abstract":"This article highlights the contribution of ethnography and qualitative sociology to the ethical challenges that frame the diagnosis of dementia. To illustrate this contribution, the paper draws on an ethnographic study of UK memory clinics carried out between 2012 and 2014. The ethnographic data, set alongside other studies and sociological theory, contest the promotion of a traditional view of autonomy; the limiting of the point of ethical interest to a distinct moment of diagnosis disclosure; and the failure to recognise risk and uncertainty in the building of clinical 'facts' and their communication. In addressing these specific concerns, this article contributes to the wider debate over the relationship between sociology and bioethics (medical ethics). At the heart of these debates lies more fundamental questions: how can we best understand and shape moral decision-making and ethics that guide behaviour in medical practice, and what should be the guiding ideas, concepts and methods to inform ethics in the clinic? Using the case of dementia diagnosis, this article illustrates the benefits of an ethnographic approach, not just for understanding this ethical problem but also for exploring if and how a more empirically informed ethics can help shape healthcare practices for the better.\n",

Verbal mistreatment was measured using the verbal aggression sub-scale of the Conflict Tactics Scale and logistic regression analysis was used to examine factors associated with increased risk.\nRESULTS: Verbal aggression as a conflict resolution style was self reported by 60.1% of caregivers, and was reported as a technique used against them by 74.8% of family members with AD. Logistic regression analysis suggests that factors associated with increased risk for verbal aggression by caregivers included being female, providing care to verbally aggressive elders, caregiver's diminished cognitive status, high levels of psychiatric symptoms, depression, or experiencing a high degree of caregiver hassle. Additionally, a significant interaction effect was found between levels of depression in caregivers and dementia symptoms in elders, as well as between levels of psychiatric symptoms in caregivers, feelings of caregiver hassle, and depression in care recipients and risk for verbal mistreatment.\nIMPLICATIONS: This study highlights the importance of both risks and vulnerabilities in the outcome of verbal mistreatment, and identifies that in many cases verbal mistreatment may be a reciprocal phenomenain dyads of caregivers and persons with AD.\n",

        "Abstract":"UNLABELLED: In recent years, researchers have provided data to show that individuals with Alzheimer's disease (AD) can learn new information and functional behaviors, despite significant declarative memory deficits. However, clinicians in long-term care frequently have difficulty justifying and providing needed services to persons with Alzheimer's disease in LTC settings. In this paper, implicit learning will be discussed as a theoretical rationale to support rehabilitation along with practical issues related to the provision of speech-language pathology services for residents with Alzheimer's disease in LTC settings.\nLEARNING OUTCOMES: After reading this article, learners will be able to: (1) Define implicit learning; (2) discuss evidence for implicit learning in Alzheimer's disease; (3) describe how to capitalize on implicit learning during rehabilitation for individuals with Alzheimer's disease; (4) explain how to justify and provide interventions for individuals with Alzheimer's disease in LTC settings.

        "Abstract":"BACKGROUND: The majority of people with dementia in the UK die in care homes. The quality of end of life care in these environments is often suboptimal. The aim of the present study was to explore the context, mechanisms and outcomes for providing good palliative care to people with advanced dementia residing in UK care homes from the perspective of health and social care providers.\nMETHOD: The design of the study was qualitative which involved purposive sampling of health care professionals to undertake interactive interviews within a realist framework. Interviews were completed between September 2012 and October 2013 and were thematically analysed and then conceptualised according to context, mechanisms and outcomes. The settings were private care homes and services provided by the National Health Service including memory clinics, mental health and commissioning services in London, United Kingdom. The participants included 14 health and social care professionals including health care assistants, care home managers, commissioners for older adults' services and nursing staff.\nRESULTS: Good palliative care for people with advanced dementia is underpinned by the prioritisation of psychosocial and spiritual care, developing relationships with family carers, addressing physical needs including symptom management and continuous, integrated care provided by a multidisciplinary team. Contextual factors that detract from good end of life care included: an emphasis on financial efficiency over person-centred care; a complex health and social care system, societal and family attitudes towards staff; staff training and experience, governance and bureaucratisation; complexity of dementia; advance care planning and staff characteristics. Mechanisms that influence the quality of end of life care include: level of health care professionals' confidence, family uncertainty about end of life care, resources for improving end of life care and supporting families, and uncertainty about whether dementia specific palliative care is required.\nCONCLUSIONS: Contextual factors regarding the care home environment may be obdurate and tend to negatively impact on the quality of end of life dementia care. Local level mechanisms may be more amenable to improvement. However, systemic changes to the care home environment are necessary to promote consistent, equitable and sustainable high quality end of life dementia care across the UK care home sector.\n",

        "Abstract":"The St. George Hospital Memory Disorders Clinic Occupational Therapy Assessment Scale (OTAS) is a performance-based assessment of activities of daily living (ADL) administered in the home environment to monitor function among patients with early cognitive decline. Of the 30 items investigated, 19 items that measured \"higher\" functional domains were found to be useful in discriminating between subjects. Psychometrically, these 19 items had high internal consistency (coefficient alpha = .89) and high interrater reliability (kappa coefficient range: .71-1.0), and correlated well with other measures of higher function (Lawton's instrumental activities of daily living scale: r = .75; Nottingham extended ADL scale: r = .67). However, unlike these latter measures, the OTAS also correlated well with the Mini-Mental State Examination (r = .73), indicating that OTAS is a valid instrument that should be sensitive to functional problems among patients in the early stages of cognitive impairment.\n",

The psychometric qualities of the Cornell scale for depression in dementia and whether depression varies depending on the dementia severity are still controversial.\nDESIGN: Cross-sectional study of memory clinic and nursing-home patients.\nMETHODS: A sample of 1682 patients (750 from memory clinics and 932 from nursing homes) with Clinical dementia rating scale score of one or higher was evaluated with the Cornell scale. The sample was randomly divided into two groups. Exploratory factor analysis was performed on one-half of the patients and confirmatory factor analysis on the other half. It was further analysed whether the scores of the sub-scales differed across CDR score.\nRESULTS: A five-factor solution fitted the data best according to both the exploratory and confirmatory factor analysis: 'mood', 'physical', 'cyclic', 'retardation' and 'behaviour'. Further, it was found that the sum score of the Cornell scale differs significantly across dementia severity (p=0.018). The mood and the cyclic sub-scales scores did not vary across dementia severity, unlike the three remaining sub-scales scores.\nCONCLUSION: A five-factor solution of the Cornell scale best fitted the data according to both exploratory and confirmatory factor analysis. The mood and cyclic factors' scores did not vary across dementia severity, and this might suggest that they are the core symptoms of depression that are equally present regardless of dementia severity. The other factors scores were higher in severe dementia, which might suggest that these factors are related to the dementia. Copyright Â© 2015 Elsevier B.V. All rights reserved.\n",

        "Abstract":"Alzheimer's disease has a negative impact on family relationships and may trigger conflicts between the main caregiver and other family members. The systemic approach evidences the impact of dementia on structural and functional characteristics of the family system. Systemic family therapy is especially indicated in crisis situations such as emergency hospitalization or institutionalization of the patient, and when the family members do not agree on when and how to introduce care and support services at the patient's home. In this case, the aim of the intervention is to restore the communication between all the family members in order to find an agreement for the best management of the patients. Since September 2006, systemic family therapy has been offered in the memory clinic of the Broca Hospital to families having a member suffering from Alzheimer's disease. The involvement of the families was accomplished by the direct participation of the patient, main caregiver (spouse), grown-up children and grandchildren. The aim was to obtain an agreement for the access of support and care services at home from all the family members. The intervention was based on a step-by-step procedure and comprehended five sessions. The primary results of a pilot study are presented.\n",

        "Abstract":"BACKGROUND: The use of dietary supplements (DS) is common among persons with dementia. Direct risks associated with DS use include adverse events and DS-drug interactions. A direct risk is a risk caused by the treatment itself. Indirect risks are related to the treatment setting, such as the conditions of use, and not to the treatment itself. Because dementia symptoms may reduce a person's ability to cope with the administration of DS, the use of DS may pose a threat to safety as an indirect risk. The aim of this study was to describe the extent of DS use among persons with dementia in ambulatory care and to identify some relevant direct and indirect risks related to DS use.\nMETHODS: We conducted a survey among 151 persons with dementia attending an outpatient memory clinic in Northern Norway. Study measurements included: the participants' characteristics, cognitive functioning, functioning in the activities of daily living (ADL), and the use of DS and prescription drugs (PD). We assessed direct risks by evaluating potential DS-drug interactions and indirect risks by evaluating the conditions under which it was used.\nRESULTS: Forty-six percent (n = 70) of the persons with dementia used DS. Ninety-seven percent (n = 147) used PD. We found potentially clinically relevant DS-drug interactions representing a direct risk in eight persons with dementia (11% of users). While only 36% (n = 26) of the participants received assistance with the administration of DS, 73% (n = 106) received assistance with the administration of PD. Persons with dementia living alone were at risk of not receiving assistance, as home care service seldom was involved in DS administration. Data indicated that assistance with DS administration was not provided for all persons with dementia in need, representing an indirect risk to these persons. Only one-third of the persons with dementia and half of the caregivers were aware of the general risks of adverse events and interactions associated with the use of DS.\nCONCLUSIONS: Persons with dementia use DS frequently, yet DS use may be associated with direct and indirect risks to patient safety as potentially clinically relevant interactions were discovered and DS intake often was unsupervised.\n",

        "Abstract":"Inability to perform activities of daily life is inherent to dementia and an essential component of its severity. Examination of this disability is crucial for diagnosis, management of the patient and family, and evaluation of treatment effects. To examine everyday disability in community-dwelling patients with mild dementia, we developed the Interview for Deterioration in Daily living Activities in Dementia (IDDD) at the memory clinic of the Academic Medical Center at Amsterdam. The IDDD is a caregiver-based measure, which consists of 20 concretely worded items, reflecting the initiative to perform and actual performance of self-care and more complex activities. The original version of the IDDD (1988) was an interview measure, but since 1990 a paper-and-pencil version has been used, which has good construct validity and test-retest reliability, as well as good responsiveness to deterioration over 6 months. In the present study, we examined interobserver agreement among 25 caregiver pairs, which consisted of primary and secondary caregivers. Although the reliability of caregiver reports is often questioned, we found substantial to almost perfect agreement at subscale level and acceptable agreement for most of the items. We conclude that the paper-and-pencil version of the IDDD is a suitable instrument for the description and discrimination of disability among patients with mild dementia still living at home. The IDDD may also be a useful method to incorporate in clinical trials and longitudinal studies.\n",

        "Abstract":"BACKGROUND: Joint reminiscence groups, involving people with dementia and family carers together, are popular, but the evidence-base is limited. This study aimed to assess the effectiveness and cost-effectiveness of joint reminiscence groups as compared to usual care.\nMETHODS: This multi-centre, pragmatic randomised controlled trial had two parallel arms: intervention group and usual-care control group. A restricted dynamic method of randomisation was used, with an overall allocation ratio of 1:1, restricted to ensure viable sized intervention groups. Assessments, blind to treatment allocation, were carried out at baseline, three months and ten months (primary end-point), usually in the person's home. Participants were recruited in eight centres, mainly through NHS Memory Clinics and NHS community mental health teams. Included participants were community resident people with mild to moderate dementia (DSM-IV), who had a relative or other care-giver in regular contact, to act as informant and willing and able to participate in intervention. 71% carers were spouses. 488 people with dementia (mean age 77.5)were randomised: 268 intervention, 220 control; 350 dyads completed the study (206 intervention, 144 control). The intervention evaluated was joint reminiscence groups (with up to 12 dyads) weekly for twelve weeks; monthly maintenance sessions for further seven months. Sessions followed a published treatment manual and were held in a variety of community settings. Two trained facilitators in each centre were supported by volunteers. Primary outcome measures were self-reported quality of life for the person with dementia (QoL-AD), psychological distress for the carer (General Health Questionnaire, GHQ-28). Secondary outcome measures included: autobiographical memory and activities of daily living for the person with dementia; carer stress for the carer; mood, relationship quality and service use and costs for both.\nRESULTS: The intention to treat analysis (ANCOVA) identified no differences in outcome between the intervention and control conditions on primary or secondary outcomes (self-reported QoL-AD mean difference 0.07 (-1.21 to 1.35), F = 0.48, p = 0.53). Carers of people with dementia allocated to the reminiscence intervention reported a significant increase in anxiety on a General Health Questionnaire-28 sub-scale at the ten month end-point (mean difference 1.25 (0.25 to 2.26), F = 8.28, p = 0.04). Compliance analyses suggested improved autobiographical memory, quality of life and relationship quality for people with dementia attending more reminiscence sessions, however carers attending more groups showed increased care-giving stress. Economic analyses from a public sector perspective indicated that joint reminiscence groups are unlikely to be cost-effective. There were no significant adverse effects attributed to the intervention. Potential limitations of the study include less than optimal attendance at the group sessions--only 57% of participants attended at least half of the intervention sessions over the 10 month period, and a higher rate of study withdrawal in the control group.\nCONCLUSIONS: This trial does not support the clinical effectiveness or cost-effectiveness of joint reminiscence groups. Possible beneficial effects for people with dementia who attend sessions as planned are offset by raised anxiety and stress in their carers. The reasons for these discrepant outcomes need to be explored further, and may necessitate reappraisal of the movement towards joint interventions.\nTRIAL REGISTRATION: ISRCTN Registry ISRCTN42430123.\n",

Disease course was described by changes in cognition (Mini Mental State Examination, clock-drawing test) and number of types of professional care applying a repeated-measures analysis using a marginal model (population-based average model). In addition, behavioral and psychological symptoms, and proportions of nursing home admissions and deaths were investigated.\nRESULTS: During 3.5 years, the average Mini Mental State Examination decreased from 22.24 to 18.91, the clock-drawing test score increased from 3.38 to 4.05, the number of types of professional care increased from 0.85 to 2.64, and the patients with behavioral and psychological symptoms increased from 29.0% to 70.2%. The proportion of patients admitted to a nursing home was 40.8% and 41.0% died.\nCONCLUSIONS: Cognition and behaviour of AD patients deteriorated accompanied with an increase in care-dependency during 3.5 years. Nevertheless, compared with the precholinesterase inhibitor era, current pharmacological and nonpharmacological interventions appear to slow cognitive decline, which emphasizes that they seem to have a favorable effect.\n",

        "Abstract":"BACKGROUND: Alzheimer's disease (AD), the most common cause of dementia, is a major cause of disability and care burden in the elderly. This study aims to estimate the costs of formal and informal care and identity determinants of care costs.\nMATERIALS AND METHODS: Two hundred and seventy-two (AD) patients and their caregivers were recruited among patients attending regular visits at six memory clinic in Sweden, Denmark, Norway and Finland. Patients with a diagnosis of AD and with an identifiable primary caregiver were eligible for inclusion. Data was collected by questionnaires at baseline, and at scheduled follow-up visits after 6 months and again after 12 months. Cognitive function was assessed with the Mini Mental State Examination (MMSE) and behavioural disturbances were measured using a brief version of the neuropsychiatric inventory (NPI).\nRESULTS: Total annual costs were on average 172,000 SEK, ranging from 60,700 SEK in mild dementia to 375,000 SEK in severe dementia. Costs for community care (special accommodation, home help, etc.) constituted about half of total costs of care and increase sharply with increasing cognitive impairment. Informal care costs, valued at the opportunity cost of the caregiver's time, make up about a third of total costs and also increased significantly with disease severity. Medical care costs (inpatient care, outpatient care, pharmaceuticals), on the other hand, were not significantly related to disease severity. Regression analysis confirmed a strong association between costs and cognitive function, between patients as well as within patients over time. There was also a significant influence on costs from behavioural disturbances. Sensitivity analysis showed that the method chosen to value informal care can have considerable impact on results.\nCONCLUSIONS: Costs of care in patient with AD are high and related to dementia severity as well as presence of behavioural disturbances. The cost estimates presented have implications for future economic evaluation of treatments for Alzheimer's disease.\n",

The objective of this study was to assess the effect of early psychosocial intervention on delaying the institutionalization of persons with AD. We also assessed the influence of intervention on AD progression, behavioral symptoms, and health-related quality of life (HRQoL) in persons with AD and caregivers.\nMETHODS: Kuopio ALSOVA study, a prospective, randomized intervention study with a 3-year follow-up, was carried out at memory clinics. Home-dwelling persons with very mild or mild AD (n = 236) and AD-targeted therapy and their family caregivers (n = 236) were randomized to the intervention or control group (1:2). Psychosocial intervention including education, counseling, and social support was given during the first 2 years (16 days). The primary outcome was the cumulative risk (controlled for death) of institutionalization over 36 months. Secondary outcomes were adjusted mean changes from baseline in disease severity, cognition, daily activities, behavior, and HRQoL for persons with AD; and change in psychological distress, depression, and HRQoL for caregivers.\nRESULTS: No differences were found in nursing home placement after the 36-month follow-up between intervention and control groups. No beneficial effects of the intervention were found on the secondary outcomes.\nCONCLUSIONS: The psychosocial intervention did not delay nursing home placement in persons with AD and had no effect on patient well-being, disease progression, or AD-related symptoms or caregiver well-being. Instead of automatically providing psychosocial intervention courses, individualized support programs may be more effective. Copyright Â© 2015 John Wiley & Sons, Ltd.\n",

Two RCTs found that general practitioner (GP) education increased suspected dementia cases. One RCT found up to six home visits from a specialist geriatric nurse over 30 months increased the rate of accurately diagnosed dementia. There was preliminary evidence from non-randomised studies that memory clinics increase timely diagnosis, but no evidence they increase the overall diagnosis rate.\nCONCLUSIONS: There is good quality evidence that GP education increases the number of suspected dementia cases but not accurate or earlier dementia diagnoses. One RCT reported that multiple visits from a trained nurse increase the diagnosis rate. There is no cost effectiveness evidence. Our findings suggest good quality RCTs are needed to test the effectiveness and cost-effectiveness of interventions to increase dementia detection. Copyright Â© 2014 John Wiley & Sons, Ltd.\n",

        "Abstract":"BACKGROUND: Neuropsychiatric symptoms (NPS) are highly prevalent in dementia. The recently developed Neuropsychiatric Inventory - Clinician rating scale (NPI-C) includes clinical judgment and new symptom domains. Our objective was to evaluate NPI-C reliability and to compare caregiver and clinician ratings across the range of mild to severe cognitive impairment.\nMETHODS: This is a cross-sectional observational study. Participants were geriatric memory clinic patients and nursing-home residents (n = 30) with an established diagnosis of dementia or Mild Cognitive Impairment (MCI). A psychiatrist (MK) interviewed caregiver-patient dyads using the NPI-C. Neuropsychological tests and Mini-Mental State Examination (MMSE) were used to assess cognitive impairment. Two NPI-C caregiver interviews were videotaped and rated by psychologists and geriatricians. Intra-class correlations (ICCs) were used to examine inter-rater agreement. Correlation coefficients were calculated to evaluate caregiver and psychiatrist NPI-C ratings. Disagreement between caregiver and clinician was expressed in delta scores and examined across the range of mild to severe cognitive impairment, using Levene's homogeneity of variances tests.\nRESULTS: Inter-rater agreement on ratings of two caregiver videos was high (ICC = 0.99-1.0). Clinician-caregiver concordance on NPI-C total severity ratings was high (r = 0.77). Variability in clinician-caregiver concordance was associated with cognitive impairment: MMSE (P = 0.02), CAMCOG-R (Cambridge Cognitive Examination-revised) total scores (P = 0.02), CAMCOG-R Memory scores (P = 0.04) and Language scores (P = 0.01).\nCONCLUSIONS: The NPI-C is a reliable measure of NPS in patients with MCI or dementia. Clinician-caregiver agreement on NPS severity may vary with cognitive impairment, underlining the importance of clinician-based measures of NPS.\n",

        "Abstract":"AIM: To develop experimental multi-domain interventions for older people with mild-to-moderate dementia, and to evaluate the effect of delaying cognitive and physical decline, and improvement or prevention of geriatric syndromes during 1-year follow up.\nMETHODS: Participants aged 65 years and older with mild-to-moderate dementia (clinical dementia rating [CDR] 1 or 2) were grouped as intervention in Jia-Li Veterans Home and usual care model in the community (Memory clinic). All residents in Jia-Li Veterans Home received comprehensive intervention, including Multi-disciplinary team consultation and intervention, Multi-component non-pharmacological management, geriatric syndromes survey and intervention by CGA, and a dementia friendly medical Green channel Approach (2MCGA). The decline of cognitive and physical function are determined by the change of Mini-Mental State Examination score, CDR and the sum of CDR box, as well as activities of daily living based on the Barthel Index. We also screened geriatric syndromes at baseline and 1 year later.\nRESULTS: Participants in the intervention group were older and had a lower educational level, lower body mass index, poor baseline activities of daily living function, lower visual impairment, and higher rates of hearing impairment, polypharmacy and risk of malnutrition. The residents receiving 2MCGA had lower baseline Mini-Mental State Examination scores, and higher CDR. For residents in Jia-Li Veterans Home, all cognitive measurements except Mini-Mental State Examination were significantly associated with delaying the decline of cognition after analyzing by multiple linear regression, and multivariate logistic regression also showed that patients living in the community was independently associated with a higher odds ratio for activities of daily living decline (3.180, 95% CI 1.384-7.308, P = 0.006). There are also more improvement in their baseline geriatric syndromes and suffered less from new geriatric syndromes, including falls, urinary incontinence, and risk of malnutrition.\nCONCLUSIONS: The 2MCGA intervention shows strong delays in the decline of cognition and physical function for older residents with mild-to-moderate dementia. Furthermore, this strategy can also improve or prevent the onset of new geriatric syndromes, especially fall episodes, urinary incontinence and risk of malnutrition.

        "Abstract":"BACKGROUND: Interest in electronic health (eHealth) technologies to screen for and treat a variety of medical and mental health problems is growing exponentially. However, no studies to date have investigated the feasibility of using such e-tools for older adults with mild cognitive impairment (MCI) or dementia.\nOBJECTIVE: The objective of this study was to describe patterns of Internet use, as well as interest in and preferences for eHealth technologies among older adults with varying degrees of cognitive impairment.\nMETHODS: A total of 221 participants (mean age=67.6 years) attending the Healthy Brain Ageing Clinic at the University of Sydney, a specialist mood and memory clinic for adults >=50 years of age, underwent comprehensive clinical and neuropsychological assessment and completed a 20-item self-report survey investigating current technology use and interest in eHealth technologies. Descriptive statistics and Fisher exact tests were used to characterize the findings, including variability in the results based on demographic and diagnostic factors, with diagnoses including subjective cognitive impairment (SCI), MCI, and dementia.\nRESULTS: The sample comprised 27.6% (61\/221) SCI, 62.0% (137\/221) MCI, and 10.4% (23\/221) dementia (mean Mini-Mental State Examination=28.2). The majority of participants reported using mobile phones (201\/220, 91.4%) and computers (167\/194, 86.1%) routinely, with most respondents having access to the Internet at home (204\/220, 92.6%). Variability was evident in the use of computers, mobile phones, and health-related websites in relation to sociodemographic factors, with younger, employed respondents with higher levels of education being more likely to utilize these technologies. Whereas most respondents used email (196\/217, 90.3%), the use of social media websites was relatively uncommon. The eHealth intervention of most interest to the broader sample was memory strategy training, with 82.7% (172\/208) of participants reporting they would utilize this form of intervention. Preferences for other eHealth interventions varied in relation to educational level, with university-educated participants expressing greater interest in interventions related to mood (P=.01), socialization (P=.02), memory (P=.01), and computer-based exercises (P=.046). eHealth preferences also varied in association, with diagnosis for interventions targeting sleep (P=.01), nutrition (P=.004), vascular risk factors (P=.03), and memory (P=.02).\nCONCLUSIONS: Technology use is pervasive among older adults with cognitive impairment, though variability was noted in relation to age, education, vocational status, and diagnosis. There is also significant interest in Web-based interventions targeting cognition and memory, as well as other risk factors for cognitive decline, highlighting the urgent need for the development, implementation, and study of eHealth technologies tailored specifically to older adults, including those with MCI and early dementia. Strategies to promote eHealth use among older adults who are retired or have lower levels of education will also need to be considered.

        "Abstract":"OBJECTIVE: The aim of this study is to determine empirically a possible classification of psychotic symptoms, and identify the frequency of such symptoms in dementia with Lewy bodies (DLB).\nMETHODS: This was a clinical study of prospectively observed patients from the memory clinic at Shiga Medical Center. The authors conducted a factor analysis of psychotic symptoms in 96 probable DLB and 4 possible DLB patients, clinically diagnosed according to the consensus criteria, were included.\nRESULTS: Four factors were obtained. Factor 1 was closely akin to misidentifications, including Capgras syndrome, phantom boarder, and reduplication of people and places. Factor 2 consisted of reduplication of people, the belief that deceased relatives are still alive, and the belief that absent relatives are in the house, which was classified as a type of misidentification or paramnesia. Factor 3 was akin to visual hallucinations of nonhuman objects, and factor 4 mirrored the hallucination of people and feeling of presence. Delusions were independent of these factors. Following the results of factor analysis, the rates of each symptom group were identified. Hallucinations were the most frequent psychotic symptom in DLB (78%), followed by misidentifications (56%) and delusions (25%).\nCONCLUSION: This study suggested that hallucinations, misidentifications, and delusions should be separately considered in understanding of underlying pathophysiology or psychopathology of DLB.\n",

        "Abstract":"IMPORTANCE: Microbleeds are more prevalent in patients with Alzheimer disease (AD) compared with the general elderly population. In addition, microbleeds have been found to predict mortality in AD.\nOBJECTIVE: To investigate whether microbleeds in AD increase the risk for mortality, stroke (including intracerebral hemorrhage), and cardiovascular events.\nDESIGN, SETTING AND PARTICIPANTS: The MISTRAL (do MIcrobleeds predict STRoke in ALzheimer's disease) Study is a longitudinal cohort study within the memory clinic-based Amsterdam Dementia Cohort. We selected all patients with AD with a baseline visit between January 2, 2002, and December 16, 2009, and microbleeds (n = 111) and matched those (1:2) for age, sex, and magnetic resonance imaging scanner to 222 patients with AD without microbleeds. After a minimal follow-up of 3 years, information on all-cause mortality, stroke-related mortality, and cardiovascular mortality was obtained between November 1, 2012, and May 1, 2014. In addition, we obtained information on the occurrence of incident stroke or transient ischemic attack, cardiovascular events, and nursing home admittance.\nMAIN OUTCOMES AND MEASURES: Stroke-related mortality, incident stroke, and intracerebral hemorrhage.\nRESULTS: Patients had a mean (SD) age of 71.2 (7.8) years and 127 (42%) were female. Compared with having no microbleeds, microbleeds in lobar locations were associated with an increased risk for stroke-related mortality (hazard ratio [HR], 33.9; 95% CI, 2.5-461.7), whereas nonlobar microbleeds were associated with an increased risk for cardiovascular mortality (HR, 12.0; 95% CI, 3.2-44.7). In addition, lobar microbleeds were associated with an increased risk for incident stroke (HR, 3.8; 95% CI, 1.5-10.1) and nonlobar microbleeds with an increased risk for cardiovascular events (HR, 6.2; 95% CI, 1.5-25.0). Even higher risks for incident stroke and cardiovascular events were found in patients using antithrombotic medication. All 5 patients with an intracerebral hemorrhage had lobar microbleeds at baseline; 4 of them used antithrombotics.\nCONCLUSIONS AND RELEVANCE: In patients with AD, the presence of nonlobar microbleeds was associated with an increased risk for cardiovascular events and cardiovascular mortality. Patients with lobar microbleeds had an increased risk for stroke and stroke-related mortality, indicating that these patients should be treated with the utmost care.\n",

        "Abstract":"OBJECTIVES: The aim of the REMiniscence groups for people with dementia and their family CAREgivers (REMCARE) study was to assess the effectiveness and cost-effectiveness of joint reminiscence groups for people with dementia and their family caregivers as compared with usual care.\nDESIGN: A multicentre, pragmatic randomised controlled trial with two parallel arms - an intervention group and a usual-care control group - was carried out. A restricted dynamic method of randomisation was used with an overall allocation ratio of 1 : 1, restricted to ensure intervention groups of a viable size. Assessments, blind to treatment allocation, were carried out at baseline, 3 months and 10 months (primary end point).\nSETTING: Most participants were recruited through NHS Memory Clinics and Community Mental Health Teams for older people. Assessments were usually carried out in the person's home, and treatment groups were held in a variety of community settings.\nPARTICIPANTS: A total of 488 individuals (mean age 77.5 years) with mild to moderate dementia (meeting Diagnostic and Statistical Manual of Mental Disorders-Fourth Edition criteria), who were initially living in the community, and who had a relative or other caregiver maintaining regular contact, who could act as an informant and was willing and able to participate in the intervention, were recruited to the study. Most carers were spouses (71%). A total of 350 dyads completed the study.\nINTERVENTIONS: The intervention consisted of joint reminiscence groups held weekly for 12 consecutive weeks, followed by monthly maintenance sessions for a further 7 months. The sessions followed a treatment manual, and were led by two trained facilitators in each centre, supported by a number of volunteers. Up to 12 dyads were invited to attend each group.\nMAIN OUTCOME MEASURES: The primary outcome measures were self-reported quality of life for the person with dementia and psychological distress for the carer [General Health Questionnaire-28 item version (GHQ-28)]. Secondary outcome measures included autobiographical memory and activities of daily living for the person with dementia, carer stress for the carer and mood, relationship quality and service use and costs for both parties.\nRESULTS: The intention-to-treat analysis identified no differences in outcome between the intervention and control conditions on primary or secondary outcomes [self-reported quality of life in Alzheimer's disease: mean difference 0.07, standard error (SE) 0.65; F = 0.48; p = 0.53]. Carers of people with dementia allocated to the reminiscence intervention reported a significant increase in anxiety on a subscale of the GHQ-28 at the 10-month end point (mean difference 1.25, SE 0.5; F = 8.28; p = 0.04). Compliance analyses suggested some benefits for people with dementia who attended more reminiscence sessions; however, carers attending more groups showed increased caregiving stress. Use of health- and social-care services was modest, with no significant difference in service use between conditions. Owing to negligible difference in quality-adjusted life-year gains (derived from European Quality of Life-5 Dimensions) between the conditions the planned full economic analysis was curtailed.\nCONCLUSIONS: This trial does not provide support for the effectiveness or cost-effectiveness of joint reminiscence groups for people with dementia and their carers. Although there may be some beneficial effects for people with dementia who attend sessions as planned, this must be viewed in the context of raised anxiety and stress in their carers. The reasons for these discrepant outcomes need to be explored further, and may necessitate reappraisal of the movement towards joint interventions.\nTRIAL REGISTRATION: Current Controlled Trials ISRCTN42430123.\nFUNDING: This project was funded by the NIHR Health Technology Assessment programme and will be published in full in Health Technology Assessment; Vol. 16, No. 48.

        "Abstract":"BACKGROUND: Repeat cognitive testing is an essential diagnostic strategy to measure changes in cognition over time when following people with memory problems. Alternate forms may avert practice effects that can mimic improvements in cognition. We evaluated alternate forms of verbal fluency and logical memory (paragraph recall) tasks to evaluate their equivalence for clinical use.\nMETHODS: Participants with mild cognitive impairment (MCI) and dementia were recruited from five outpatient memory clinics and one nursing home. Participants with normal cognition (NC) were recruited from family members or friends. Verbal fluency categories of animals, cities & towns, fruits & vegetables and first names were used. Scores were recorded for 0-30 seconds, 31-60 seconds and errors. For the logical memory task, participants were read one of three different paragraphs and then were asked to recall the story. Immediate recall and delayed recall scores were recorded. The Standardized Mini-mental State Examination, the AB Cognitive Screen and the 15-point Geriatric Depression Scale were administered as part of the assessment. Analyses were performed using means, frequency distributions, t-tests, receiver-operating characteristic curves and effect sizes.\nRESULTS: There were 46 NC participants, 45 with MCI and 55 with dementia. For verbal fluency, the mean number of animals, cities & towns, names or fruits & vegetables named in 60 seconds did not differ significantly within each cognitive group. First names was an easier category than the others: NC named 16.9-22.3 items, MCI named 11.6-14.4 items and dementia named 8.1-11.4 items. The mean number of items immediately recalled in logical memory was not significantly different for the three paragraphs. The verbal fluency task (in 60 seconds) and logical memory immediate recall were highly sensitive and specific to differences between NC and MCI (areas under the curves 0.87 and 0.76, respectively).\nCONCLUSIONS: Alternate forms allow serial testing without learning bias. Verbal fluency and logical memory tasks are sensitive to early cognitive changes.\n",

Hospitalizations, nursing home admission, weight loss, and death occurring during the past year were recorded. Information on sociodemographic characteristics, clinical conditions, therapy, and physical and cognitive status was recorded.\nRESULTS: At inclusion, 348 (30.8%) of the 1,131 participants lived alone. Living alone did not increase the risk of mortality or weight loss in individuals with mild to moderate AD, but significant associations with risk of hospitalization (hazard ratio (HR) = 1.33, 95% confidence interval (CI) = 1.01-1.74) and institutionalization (HR = 2.53, 95% CI = 1.84-3.47) were reported. A protective effect of physical function on institutionalization and mortality was found.\nCONCLUSION: These results might support clinicians in making decisions about institutionalization of individuals with AD living alone or improving home health care, such as increasing screening and managing functional impairment in this complex population.

Factor analysis of the Greene Caregiver Stress Scale (15 items) identified two factors; 'Social stress' and 'Depressive stress'. Social stress was associated with the patient's I-ADL level, and depressive stress with mood and behaviour of the patient. The depressive symptomatology of the patient as expressed by the spouses was related to both depressive and social stress, whereas cognitive function, as measured by the MMSE, was not an independent predictor of carer strain.\nCONCLUSION: Even in mildly demented patients, symptoms of carer stress are frequent. Supportive strategies such as early diagnosis, information for carers and intervention strategies are discussed.\n",

        "Abstract":"BACKGROUND: Increasing physical activity (PA) effectively in those who are inactive is challenging. For those who have subjective memory complaints (SMC) or mild cognitive impairment (MCI) this is a greater challenge necessitating the need for more engaging and innovative approaches. The primary aim of this trial is to determine whether a home-based 6-month PA intervention with individual goal-setting and peer mentors (GM-PA) can significantly increase PA levels in insufficiently active older adults at increased risk of developing Alzheimer's disease (AD).\nMETHODS: Community living 60-80 year olds with SMC or MCI who do not engage in more than 60 min per week of moderate intensity PA will be recruited from memory clinics and the community via media advertisements to participate in this randomized, single-blind controlled trial. All participants will receive an individually tailored home-based PA program of 150 min of moderate intensity walking\/week for 6 months. The intervention group will undertake individual goal-setting and behavioral education workshops with mentor support via telephone (GM-PA). Those randomized to the control group will have standard education workshops and Physical Activity Liaison (PAL) contact via telephone (CO-PA). Increase in PA is the primary outcome, fitness, cognitive, personality, demographic and clinical parameters will be measured and a health economic analysis performed. A saliva sample will be collected for APOE e4 genotyping. All participants will have a goal-setting interview to determine their PA goals. Active volunteers aged 50-85 years will be recruited from the community randomized and trained to provide peer support as mentors (intervention group) or PALS (control group) for the 6-month intervention. Mentors and PALS will have PA, exercise self-efficacy and mentoring self-efficacy measured. Participants in both groups are asked to attend 3 workshops in 6 months. At the first workshop, they will meet their allocated Mentor or PAL who will deliver their respective programs and support via 6 telephone calls during the intervention.\nDISCUSSION: If the GM-PA program is successful in increasing the PA levels of the target group it will potentially provide another strategy and community resource that can be translated into practice.\nTRIAL REGISTRATION: Australia New Zealand Clinical Trials Registry ACTRN12613001181796 .

        "Abstract":"BACKGROUND: Group cognitive stimulation therapy programmes can benefit cognition and quality of life for people with dementia. Evidence for home-based, carer-led cognitive stimulation interventions is limited.\nOBJECTIVES: To evaluate the clinical effectiveness and cost-effectiveness of carer-delivered individual cognitive stimulation therapy (iCST) for people with dementia and their family carers, compared with treatment as usual (TAU).\nDESIGN: A multicentre, single-blind, randomised controlled trial assessing clinical effectiveness and cost-effectiveness. Assessments were at baseline, 13 weeks and 26 weeks (primary end point).\nSETTING: Participants were recruited through Memory Clinics and Community Mental Health Teams for older people.\nPARTICIPANTS: A total of 356 caregiving dyads were recruited and 273 completed the trial.\nINTERVENTION: iCST consisted of structured cognitive stimulation sessions for people with dementia, completed up to three times weekly over 25 weeks. Family carers were supported to deliver the sessions at home.\nMAIN OUTCOME MEASURES: Primary outcomes for the person with dementia were cognition and quality of life. Secondary outcomes included behavioural and psychological symptoms, activities of daily living, depressive symptoms and relationship quality. The primary outcome for the family carers was mental\/physical health (Short Form questionnaire-12 items). Health-related quality of life (European Quality of Life-5 Dimensions), mood symptoms, resilience and relationship quality comprised the secondary outcomes. Costs were estimated from health and social care and societal perspectives.\nRESULTS: There were no differences in any of the primary outcomes for people with dementia between intervention and TAU [cognition: mean difference -0.55, 95% confidence interval (CI) -2.00 to 0.90; p-value = 0.45; self-reported quality of life: mean difference -0.02, 95% CI -1.22 to 0.82; p-value = 0.97 at the 6-month follow-up]. iCST did not improve mental\/physical health for carers. People with dementia in the iCST group experienced better relationship quality with their carer, but there was no evidence that iCST improved their activities of daily living, depression or behavioural and psychological symptoms. iCST seemed to improve health-related quality of life for carers but did not benefit carers' resilience or their relationship quality with their relative. Carers conducting more sessions had fewer depressive symptoms. Qualitative data suggested that people with dementia and their carers experienced better communication owing to iCST. Adjusted mean costs were not significantly different between the groups. From the societal perspective, both health gains and cost savings were observed.\nCONCLUSIONS: iCST did not improve cognition or quality of life for people with dementia, or carers' physical and mental health. Costs of the intervention were offset by some reductions in social care and other services. Although there was some evidence of improvement in terms of the caregiving relationship and carers' health-related quality of life, iCST does not appear to deliver clinical benefits for cognition and quality of life for people with dementia. Most people received fewer than the recommended number of iCST sessions. Further research is needed to ascertain the clinical effectiveness of carer-led cognitive stimulation interventions for people with dementia.\nTRIAL REGISTRATION: Current Controlled Trials ISRCTN65945963.\nFUNDING: This project was funded by the National Institute of Health Research (NIHR) Health Technology Assessment (HTA) programme and will be published in full in Health Technology Assessment; Vol. 19, No. 64.

        "Abstract":"BACKGROUND\/AIMS: Vascular pathology is increasingly seen as a factor contributing to the development of Alzheimer's disease (AD). With this in mind we hypothesized that this vascular pathology could be directly detected in the arteries contributing to the cerebral circulation of mild cognitive impairment (MCI) and AD patients by means of wall shear stress (WSS) measurements.\nMETHODS: In this study we investigated the mean wall shear stress (MWSS), diastolic wall shear stress (DWSS) and systolic wall shear stress (SWSS) in the carotid and basilar arteries of control subjects (mean age: 72; SD: 8.8), patients suffering from MCI (mean age: 76; SD: 6.7), and patients suffering from AD (mean age: 72; SD: 8.2) that were consecutively referred to our outpatient memory clinic using in-house developed software on gradient echo phase-contrast MRI sequences.\nRESULTS: We found that all these parameters were significantly lower in the carotid arteries of patients suffering from AD or MCI when compared to control subjects. In the basilar artery only DWSS was lower in MCI or AD patients compared to control subjects. In none of the arteries a difference was found for any WSS parameter between MCI and AD patients. WSS parameters were significantly associated (corrected for age and sex) with the degree of cognitive impairment.\nCONCLUSION: Increased vascular pathology, as expressed by lower WSS measures, was found in patients suffering from MCI and AD compared to normal controls. This might point to the involvement of vascular pathology in the development of AD. Copyright 2009 S. Karger AG, Basel.\n",

        "Abstract":"OBJECTIVES: To examine the long-term efficacy at the 36-month follow-up of an early psychosocial counselling and support programme lasting 8-12 months for community-dwelling patients with mild Alzheimer's disease and their caregivers.\nDESIGN: Multicentre, randomised, controlled, rater-blinded trial.\nSETTING: Primary care and memory clinics in five Danish districts.\nPARTICIPANTS: 330 home-dwelling patients with mild Alzheimer's disease and their primary caregivers (dyads).\nINTERVENTIONS: Dyads were randomised to receive intervention during the first year after diagnosis. Both intervention and control groups had follow-up visits at 3, 6, 12 and 36 months.\nMAIN OUTCOME MEASURES: Primary outcomes for the patients assessed at 36-month follow-up were changes from baseline in global cognitive function (Mini-Mental State Examination), depressive symptoms (Cornell Depression Scale) and proxy-rated EuroQoL quality of life on visual analogue scale. The primary outcomes for the caregivers were changes from baseline in depressive symptoms (Geriatric Depression Scale) and self-rated EuroQoL quality of life on a visual analogue scale. The secondary outcome measures for the patient were proxy-rated Quality of Life Scale for Alzheimer's disease (QoL-AD), Neuropsychiatric Inventory-Questionnaire, Alzheimer's disease Cooperative Study Activities of Daily Living Scale, all-cause mortality and nursing home placement.\nRESULTS: At a 36-month follow-up, 2 years after the completion of the Danish Alzheimer Intervention Study (DAISY), the unadjusted positive effects previously detected at the 12-month follow-up in one patient primary outcome (Cornell depression score) and one patient secondary outcome (proxy-rated QoL-AD) disappeared (Cornell depression score, p=0.93; proxy-rated QoL-AD, p=0.81). No long-term effect of DAISY intervention on any other primary and secondary outcomes was found at the 36-month follow-up.\nCONCLUSIONS: For patients with very mild Alzheimer's disease and their caregivers, an intensive, multi-component, semitailored psychosocial intervention programme with counselling, education and support during the first year after diagnosis did not show any positive long-term effect on primary and secondary outcomes.\nTRIAL REGISTRATION: The study was registered in the Clinical Trial Database (http:\/\/www.controlled-trials.com\/ISRCTN74848736).\n",

We describe a structured set of activities that laid the foundation for a new partnership with the primary care practice and the lessons learned in implementing this new care model. We also provide a description of the core components of this innovative memory care program.\nRESULTS: Findings from three recent randomized clinical trials provided the rationale and basic components for implementing the new memory care program. We used the reflective adaptive process as a relationship building framework that recognizes primary care practices as complex adaptive systems. This framework allows for local adaptation of the protocols and procedures developed in the clinical trials. Tailored care for individual patients is facilitated through a care manager working in collaboration with a primary care physician and supported by specialists in a memory care clinic as well as by information technology resources.\nCONCLUSIONS: We have successfully overcome many system-level barriers in implementing a collaborative care program for dementia and depression in primary care. Spontaneous adoption of new models of care is unlikely without specific attention to the complexities and resource constraints of health care systems.\n",

        "Abstract":"BACKGROUND: Cognitive deficits are among the most disabling of neurological diseases and have a serious impact on the quality of life of patients and families. Cognitive training has been proven successful in improving or compensating for neuropsychological deficits after acute brain injury, but its efficacy highly depends on the intensity of treatment over an extended period of time. Therefore, cognitive training indicates expensive human resources and renders the rehabilitation process vulnerable to physical and economic barriers for the majority of patients.\nOBJECTIVE: The aim of this study was to develop and test a new Web-based rehabilitation tool that provides intensive cognitive training at home under clinical prescription and monitoring, at affordable costs.\nMETHODS: From a pool of 60 original exercises, designed and used over the past 10 years for cognitive training at our center, we developed 27 exercises on a computer game format, with automatic increase or decrease of difficulty levels. These exercises were assembled in a clean, user-friendly design and covered various cognitive domains such as attention (n=4), memory (n=11), language (n=3), calculus (n=3), praxis (n=2), and executive functions (n=3). A Web 2.0 platform was also designed to provide medical prescription of cognitive training sessions, performed at the patient's home. These sessions included continuous monitoring of compliance, performance, and evolution; algorithms for automatic adjustment and long-term learning through use, and database recording of all activities. The end-user interaction test included 80 patients from our memory clinic from several groups including subjective memory complaints (n=20), traumatic brain injury (n=20), stroke and other static brain lesions (n=20), and mild Alzheimer's disease (n=20). During a 1-hour session, patients and their relatives were taught to use the system and allowed to practice using it. At the end of the session, they were asked to complete a questionnaire.\nRESULTS: A total of 48\/80 patients (60%) attended the training session. The mean age of the patients was 60 years (SD 13.3, range 41-78), and the mean level of formal education was 6 years (range 4-16). Of all the participants, 32\/48 patients (66%) have previously used a computer. All patients and their relatives made a positive evaluation of the cognitive training tool. Only 2\/48 patients (4%) were not interested in performing the exercises at home; 19\/48 patients (39%) mentioned the need for further coaching from a relative or health care professional. The patients who mentioned difficulties in performing the exercises have not used the computer earlier.\nCONCLUSIONS: This new Web-based system was very well accepted by patients and their relatives, who showed high levels of motivation to use it on a daily basis at home. The simplicity of its use and comfort were especially outlined. This tool will have an important effect on human resource management, in increasing the patient access to specialized health care and improving the quality and national health system costs of rehabilitation programs.\n",

This type of intervention, namely its intensity, can be optimized by incorporating information technology-based systems.\nOBJECTIVE: The intent of the study was to determine the treatment intensity and patient adherence to home-based cognitive training strategies (Web-based cognitive training).\nMETHODS: A cohort of 45 patients with neurologic and psychiatric diseases attending an outpatient memory clinic (average age 50.7 years, SD 17.0; average education 7.8 years, SD 4.9) was followed over 18 months. Participants were challenged to use a Web-based cognitive training system, \"COGWEB\", on a daily basis, and fulfilled at least four weeks of training supervised remotely. Additionally, 11 patients attended face-to-face sessions.\nRESULTS: The average duration of continuous cognitive training was 18.8 weeks (SD 18.9). Each patient performed on average 363.5 minutes\/week (SD 136.6). At 6-month follow-up, 82.8% complied with their treatment plan. The average proportion of complete weeks was 0.75 (SD 0.22). Patients with dementia trained more intensively (444.6 minutes\/week), followed by patients with static brain lesion (414.5 minutes\/week; P=.01). The group that held face-to-face sessions performed more training overall (481.4 vs 366.9 minutes\/week), achieving a stronger expression and statistical significance in the last week of training (652.6 versus 354.9 minutes\/week, P=.027).\nCONCLUSIONS: Overall, the weekly training intensity was high. Patients with dementia and static lesions performed more cognitive training. Face-to-face sessions were associated with higher intensities. The combination of classical methods with information technology systems seems to ensure greater training intensity.\n",

In contrast, there is an increased emphasis on providing home and community based service delivery for a range of illnesses including dementia.\nMETHODS: This paper reports the findings of an evaluation study comparing a clinic-based and a community service. A convenience sample of 10 service users and carer dyads took part in in-depth qualitative interviews. Service users were diagnosed with mild to moderate dementia of Alzheimer's type. Interviews were recorded, transcribed and subsequently analyzed using template analysis.\nRESULTS: Service users and carers were satisfied with both services, with determinants of satisfaction differing between the two services. Issues relating to the location and spatial design of services, comfort, familiarity, communication with staff, and ease of use are highlighted as important determinants of satisfaction amongst service users and their carers.\nCONCLUSION: This study has implications for person-centred care practices in service delivery and for the future design of mental health services for people with dementia.\n",

        "Abstract":"Community-dwelling people with Alzheimer's disease are exposed to situations-at-risk at home, but this phenomenon has rarely been studied empirically. The purpose of this pilot study was to describe the safety problems experienced at home in a sample of patients with dementia seen in a memory clinic, and also to identify the factors associated with these situations-at-risk. Study participants were 38 demented persons who were living at home, and assessed in a memory clinic with a caregiver-relative. Caregiver-relatives took part in a semi-structured interview in which they completed a French version of the Safety Assessment Scale (Poulin de Courval et al., 2006). The results show that all people with dementia were exposed to risks at home. Patients living alone were perceived to be more at risk at home than those living with someone. The most commonly reported risks concerned fire, nutrition and polymedication. The assessment gathers interesting information, addressing a wide range of risks at home. The Safety Assessment Scale is a useful tool to detect the risks at home and to focus the interview with the caregivers towards their prevention, since improvements are likely to enhance safety.\n",

CSF samples were analyzed for standard AD-biomarkers and Abeta-oligomer levels using a validated in-house Abeta-oligomer specific enzyme-linked immunosorbent assay. Abeta-oligomer levels were analyzed as indicators of disease progression (follow-up AD diagnosis) and cognitive decline, respectively.\nRESULTS: Patient groups did not differ in Abeta-oligomer concentrations at baseline or follow-up. Baseline CSF Abeta-oligomer levels were similar in MCI patients that develop AD as in stable MCI patients. MCI and AD patients showed an annual decrease in Abeta-oligomer levels of 9.4% and 6.8%, respectively. A decrease in Abeta-oligomer levels over time was strongly associated with more severe cognitive decline in AD patients.\nCONCLUSION: Despite the limited diagnostic potential of Abeta-oligomer levels in CSF to differentiate between patient groups, and between MCI-AD and MCI-stable patients, changes in CSF Abeta-oligomer levels were related to cognitive decline. Therefore, CSF Abeta-oligomers may aid in the selection of patients with a more aggressive disease course.\n",

The aim of this study was to determine whether there were differences in the presence of individual BPSD between community-dwelling dementia care recipients with spouse caregivers and those with non-spouse caregivers.\nMETHODS: Care recipients (n = 109) and their primary caregivers were recruited from memory clinic outpatients at the public psychiatric hospital in Sapporo City, Japan. Data were collected by questionnaire. Relationship with the care recipient was categorized as either 'spouse' or 'non-spouse.' The frequency of BPSD occurrence observed by the caregiver was assessed using the Troublesome Behavior Scale (TBS). Logistic regression analyses were performed to examine whether there were differences with regard to each of the 14 TBS items between spouse and non-spouse caregivers.\nRESULTS: The number of spouse caregivers was 47 (43.1%). TBS items presented by >50% care recipients were 'repetition and\/or clinging' and 'ill-natured denial and\/or distortion.' After adjustment for the characteristics of caregivers and care recipients, non-spouse caregivers were found to be significantly associated with the presence of 'hiding and\/or losing things,' 'rummaging,' 'crying and\/or screaming,' and 'interfering with a happy home circle,' compared with spouse caregivers.\nCONCLUSIONS: Our results suggest that non-spouse caregivers need more support with regard to certain symptoms of individual BPSD compared with spouse caregivers. Identifying caregiver characteristics that are independently associated with each individual BPSD may help customize interventions for caregivers with specific characteristics.\n",

        "Abstract":"A combined neuropsychological and neuroimaging investigation was carried out on a patient (O.I.) with semantic dementia who had asymmetrical temporal lobe atrophy, greater on the left. His performance on tests of verbal memory was gravely impaired. Similarly, his visual memory as indexed by recognition of unfamiliar faces was impaired. By contrast, his recognition memory for topographical memoranda (e.g. buildings, landscapes) and ability to find his way around was preserved. In order to identify the neural substrates supporting the preserved recognition of static topographical memoranda, O.I. was scanned using positron emission tomography (PET) during the encoding and recognition of building and landscape stimuli. In common with control subjects, during encoding O.I. activated parahippocampal cortex bilaterally, along with bilateral temporo-parietal, retrosplenial and left frontal cortices. During recognition, both patient and controls activated right parahippocampal, right superior parietal and right frontal cortices. Notably, control subjects, but not O.I., also activated at encoding the precuneus and at recognition the retrosplenial cortex. This allows the conclusion that these two areas while involved may not be necessary for topographical memory. Interestingly, the patient also activated regions that were not evident in control subjects both during encoding and recognition. These additional areas of activation may be necessary in a compensatory role. Overall, these data represent the first reported assessment of the functional integrity of degenerating brain tissue and its contribution to preserved topographical memory. The combination of the neuropsychological and neuroimaging approaches may provide insights into the functional-anatomy of memory while having clinical utility for the assessment of residual brain tissue.\n",

        "Abstract":"OBJECTIVE: The purpose of the present study is to evaluate if the participants in psychosocial interventions for dementia caregivers are representative of the whole population of dementia patients or if some socioeconomic groups are over- or underrepresented.\nDESIGN: The demographic and socioeconomic characteristics of the 128 participants of a randomized controlled study on the effects of caregiver education were compared with those of all the elderly residents of the City of Zurich (n = 64,856, elderly group), of all demented patients entering a City of Zurich nursing home in a 6-month period (n = 218, NH entry group) and of all demented inhabitants evaluated during a 20-month follow-up at a community memory clinic (n = 187, memory group).\nMETHODS: Data on income and wealth were derived from official tax records. The characteristics of the different groups were compared by chi2 or t tests.\nRESULTS: As expected in a study on caregiver education, the demented patients were younger, more often male and married than all other study groups (p < 0.01). The participants in the psychosocial intervention had significantly (p < 0.01) higher education than all other groups; this effect is caused in part by the higher proportion of males. The NH entry group was less well educated than the elderly group (p < 0.05). The intervention group had a higher income and was wealthier than the three other groups (p < 0.01), but there was no significant difference with respect to the wealth of the memory group. The 25% poorest of the elderly group made up only about 10% of the participants in the intervention group. However, the 25% richest of the elderly group made up 42% of the intervention group. The method of recruitment for the psychosocial intervention (by media, referral of physicians and by a memory clinic) was not significantly related to any of the demographic or socioeconomic parameters.\nCONCLUSION: The lower socioeconomic strata are clearly underrepresented in psychosocial interventions.
