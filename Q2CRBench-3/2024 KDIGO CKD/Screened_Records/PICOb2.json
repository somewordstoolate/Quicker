        "Abstract":"INTRODUCTION: Hyperuricemia is a disease with abnormal purine metabolism, which leads to the increase of urate concentration. It is an independent risk factor for the occurrence and development of metabolic syndrome, type 2 diabetes, hypertension, cardiovascular disease, chronic kidney disease, and gout. The enzyme urate oxidase can metabolize urate to allantoin, resulting in decreased urate concentrations. Pegylated the urate oxidase can extend half-life and decrease immunogenicity of the protein. This trial aims to evaluate the safety, tolerability, pharmacokinetics(PK), pharmacodynamics(PD) and immunogenicity of a new intravenous PEGylated urate oxidase produced by Xiuzheng Bio-Medicine Research Institute Co., Ltd.\nMETHODS AND ANALYSIS: A randomized, double-blind, placebo-controlled, phase I, dose escalation study will be conducted in China. In total, 56 subjects will be enrolled in the study, with 24 healthy subjects in the low dose-escalation stage and 32 patients with hyperuricemia in the high dose-escalation stage. There is a bridging between the two stages. Subjects are randomized to PEGylated urate oxidase or the placebo in a 3:1 ratio in each group and followed up for 71 days observation. The primary outcomes include PK, PD, tolerability; the secondary outcomes include safety and immunogenicity.\nETHICS AND DISSEMINATION: The trial is performed abiding by the Declaration of Helsinki, Good clinical practice (GCP) and the guidelines of China National Medical Products Administration (NMPA). Relevant documents, including protocol, informed consent and drug inspection report, are all approved independently by the Medical Ethics Committee of the Affiliated Hospital of Qingdao University.

        "Abstract":"OBJECTIVE: We investigated the efficacy and safety of dotinurad, a selective urate reabsorption inhibitor, in hyperuricemic patients with advanced chronic kidney disease (CKD) (stage G3-5).\nPATIENTS AND METHODS: We retrospectively analyzed the cases of 34 patients (mean age, 68.6 ± 13.3 years; 17 men and 17 women) after 12 months of dotinurad treatment based on the changes in uric acid (UA) and the urine protein-to-creatinine ratio (UPCR) plus the annual change in estimated glomerular filtration rate (eGFR). Hyperuricemia (UA ≥6.0 mg\/dL) and advanced CKD (mean eGFR: 32.0 ± 13.3 mL\/min\/1.73m; stage G3, n=17; G4, n=13; G5, n=4) were present in all of the patients. The cases of 34 matched individuals with similar propensity scores (who were not taking dotinurad) were analyzed as a control group.\nRESULTS: UA values decreased significantly in the dotinurad group (7.1 ± 0.8 mg\/dL to 5.9 ± 1.0 mg\/dL, p<0.05) but those did not change in the control group. UPCR did not change in either group. Low-density lipoprotein cholesterol also decreased significantly in the dotinurad group (98.8 ± 43.4 mg\/dL to 82.9 ± 33.1 mg\/dL, p<0.05). With the 12-month dotinurad treatment, the annual change in the patients' eGFR was significantly improved from -6.0 ± 12.9 mL\/min\/1.73 m\/year to -0.9 ± 4.6 mL\/min\/1.73 m\/year (p<0.05), but there was no change in the control group.\nCONCLUSION: Dotinurad can decrease UA levels and might attenuate renal function decline in individuals with hyperuricemia and advanced CKD.",

However, the prevalence of dementia in patients with gout has not yet been reported.\nOBJECTIVE: To analyze the prevalence of dementia among patients diagnosed with gout by utilizing the Health Insurance and Review Assessment database, a nationwide registry of the South Korean population.\nMETHODS: Data from the Health Insurance and Review Assessment database of patients diagnosed with gout between 2011 and 2018 were extracted. The annual prevalence of dementia according to age and sex was analyzed. We investigated whether there was an association between comorbidities and gout medication in patients with both gout and dementia and in patients with only gout.\nRESULTS: Between 2011 and 2018, the age-adjusted prevalence of dementia per 100,000 persons ranged from 54.0 (95% confidence interval: 47.7-60.2) to 69.9 (95% confidence interval: 65.3-74.5). Compared to previous studies, the prevalence of dementia was lower in patients with gout than in the general population. Patients with both gout and dementia were more likely to be women, have a wide range of comorbidities, and be prescribed gout-related drugs, including allopurinol, febuxostat, nonsteroidal anti-inflammatory drugs, and steroids than patients with gout without dementia.\nCONCLUSIONS: This study demonstrated a relatively low prevalence of dementia in patients with gout.

Herein, we aimed to compare the efficacy of uric acid-lowering drugs (ULDs) or the type of the drug on patient survival using a representative sample of maintenance HD patients in South Korea.\nMETHODS: This study used data from a national HD quality assessment program and the claims data. Use of ULDs was defined as more than one prescription during the 6 months of each HD quality assessment period. The patients were divided into three groups. Patients who were not prescribed allopurinol or febuxostat were included in group 1 (n = 43,251); patients who were prescribed allopurinol were included in group 2 (n = 9,987); and patients who were prescribed febuxostat were included in group 3 (n = 2,890).\nRESULTS: Kaplan-Meier curves showed that the survival rate was greatest in group 3 and worst in group 1 among the three groups. Multivariable analysis showed that group 2 had better patient survival compared to group 1; however, there was no significant difference in patient survival between groups 2 and 3. In addition, patients with hyperuricemia or gout had better patient survival compared to those without these diseases.\nCONCLUSIONS: Our study showed that survival in patients receiving ULDs was not inferior to that of those not receiving ULDs. Patient survival between patients on HD receiving allopurinol and those receiving febuxostat was similar.",

        "Abstract":"2\nMany studies have been conducted confirming the effect of uric acid (UA) on kidney function. It is obvious that there is a relationship between the effect of UA not only on kidney function, but also on the cardiovascular system, increasing cardiovascular risk. The review article provides basic information about the pathogenesis, principles and features of prescribing therapy to patients with chronic kidney disease (CKD) and cardiovascular disease. A lot of data currently indicates that hyperuricemia, both with and without crystal deposition, is associated with high cardiovascular risk and decreased kidney function. A number of studies and meta-analyses indicate that urate-reducing therapy prevents and slows down the decline in kidney function in patients with CKD, many of whom suffer from cardiovascular diseases or at least have several risk factors. Despite the fact that currently the guidelines for the treatment of CKD do not include a recommendation for the start of urate-lowering therapy, a large amount of data has been accumulated on the potential benefits of such treatment even in the absence of a diagnosis of gout. The preferred group of drugs for this group of patients are xanthine oxidase inhibitors, and for patients with eGFR below 30 ml\/min\/1.73 m, it seems that allopurinol currently has larger evidence base for the efficacy and safety of prescribing.",

The proportion of patients with sUA < 6 mg\/dL at 1 year of follow-up is compared over the cohort groups using a chi-square test and adjusted logistic regression. Adherence to urate lowering therapy was calculated using the proportion of days covered (PDC). A -test was used to compare the average PDC and an adjusted logistic regression model was used to estimate the odds of a PDC greater than 80%.\nRESULTS: A total of 9922 patients were included in the study. Most patients were in a metropolitan (77.4%) area, followed by micropolitan (11.8%) and finally, (10.8%) in a rural area. We found no statistically significant difference among the proportion of patients achieving target sUA of <6 mg\/dL, 37.17% among metropolitan patients, 38.9% among micropolitan patients, and 37.7% for those in a rural area, -value = .502. The proportion of patients achieving 80% treatment adherence was 49.92% in the metropolitan, 51.78% in the micropolitan, and 55.05% in the rural areas, -value = .005. Adjusted regression models showed no statistically significant difference in proportions achieving target sUA levels or 80% adherence.\nCONCLUSIONS: Urban patients treated for gout did not have better gout outcomes compared to rural patients.

Blood samples were collected within 15 minutes of admission from patients in intensive care patients, which were divided into a CPA group (n = 1,053) and a no-CPA group (n = 105). Plasma XOR activity was compared between the 3 groups and factors independently associated with extremely elevated XOR activity were identified using a multivariate logistic regression model. Plasma XOR activity in the CPA group (median, 1,030.0 pmol\/hour\/mL; range, 233.0-4,240.0 pmol\/hour\/mL) was significantly higher than in the no-CPA group (median, 60.2 pmol\/hour\/mL; range, 22.5-205.0 pmol\/hour\/mL) and control group (median, 45.2 pmol\/hour\/mL; range, 19.3-98.8 pmol\/hour\/mL).

Although Pacific and Māori experience earlier onset and higher burden of gout, which can severely impact their quality of life, their management of it is often sub-optimal. Aim To conduct a scoping review of the NZ literature for interventions to improve the uptake\/management of allopurinol for gout and their evaluation. Methods Databases Medline, Scopus, Embase, and CINAHL Plus and the grey literature were searched systematically to identify all NZ intervention studies aiming to improve allopurinol uptake for gout treatment. Interventions included: if they were delivered in NZ, aimed to improve allopurinol uptake, and were provided in English. A narrative approach was used to extract and synthesise data. Results Eighteen peer-reviewed and grey literature publications met the search criteria. Interventions clustered into three domains: multifaceted or multi-practitioner; gout app; and online booklets or fact sheets. Serum urate levels improved in multi-faceted or multi-practitioner interventions only, whereas the gout app only improved patients' awareness and understanding of gout and medications. Online fact sheets and booklets need more active utilisation from health professionals to improve gout health literacy. Discussion Most gout interventions in NZ use multifaceted or multi-practitioner approaches. Although most interventions successfully controlled serum urate levels and improved equitable access for gout patients to urate-lowering therapy, these interventions did not sustain retention, completion, and engagement for certain population groups, particularly Pacific and Māori, who experience a higher burden of gout.",

Based on recent findings that plasma XOR activity increased in liver disease conditions, we conducted a sub-analysis of the BEYOND-UA study to examine the differential effects of topiroxostat on arterial stiffness based on liver function in hyperuricemic individuals with hypertension.\nMETHODS: Sixty-three subjects treated with topiroxostat were grouped according to baseline alanine aminotransferase (ALT) levels (above or below cut-off values of 22, 30, or 40 U\/L). The primary endpoint was changes in the cardio-ankle vascular index (CAVI) from baseline to 24 weeks.\nRESULTS: Significant reductions in CAVI during topiroxostat therapy occurred in subjects with baseline ALT ≥30 U\/L or ≥40 U\/L, and significant between-group differences were detected. Brachial-ankle pulse wave velocity significantly decreased in the ALT-high groups at all cut-off values. Reductions in morning home blood pressure and serum UA were similar regardless of the baseline ALT level.

The Brief Psychiatric Rating Scale (BPRS) and the event-related potential P300 were used to assess the patient's psychiatric symptoms and cognitive functioning. The link between serum UA levels, BPRS scores, and P300 was investigated.\nRESULTS: Prior to treatment, serum UA levels and latency N3 in the study group were significantly higher than in the control group, whereas the amplitude P3 was considerably lower. After therapy, the study group's BPRS scores, serum UA levels, latency N3, and amplitude P3 were lower than before treatment. According to correlation analysis, serum UA levels in the pre-treatment study group significantly positively correlated with BPRS score and latency N3 but not amplitude P3. After therapy, serum UA levels were no longer substantially related to the BPRS score or amplitude P3 but strongly and positively correlated with latency N3.\nCONCLUSIONS: First-episode schizophrenia patients have higher serum UA levels than the general population which partly reflects poor cognitive performance.

        "Abstract":"INTRODUCTION: Hyperuricemia and gout are receiving an increasing scientific and medical attention because of their relatively high prevalence and their association with relevant co-morbidities. Recently, it has been suggested that gout patients have an altered gut microbiota. The first objective of this study was to investigate the potential of some  strains to metabolize purine-related metabolites. The second objective was to evaluate the effect of administering a selected potential probiotic strain in individuals with a history of hyperuricemia.\nMETHODS: Inosine, guanosine, hypoxanthine, guanine, xanthine, and uric acid were identified and quantified by high-performance liquid chromatography analysis. The uptake and biotransformation of these compounds by a selection of  strains were assessed using bacterial whole cells and cell-free extracts, respectively. The efficacy of  CECT 30632 to prevent gout was assessed in a pilot randomized controlled clinical trial involving 30 patients with hyperuricemia and a history of recurrent gout episodes. Half of the patients consumed  CECT 30632 (9 log CFU\/day; probiotic group;  = 15) for 6 months while the remaining patients consumed allopurinol (100-300 mg\/daily; control group;  = 15) for the same period. The clinical evolution and medical treatment received by the participants were followed, as well as the changes in several blood biochemical parameters.\nRESULTS: L. salivarius CECT 30632 was the most efficient strain for inosine (100%), guanosine (100%) and uric acid (50%) conversion and, therefore, it was selected for the pilot clinical trial. In comparison with the control group, administration of  CECT 30632 resulted in a significant reduction in the number of gout episodes and in the use of gout-related drugs as well as an improvement in some blood parameters related to oxidative stress, liver damage or metabolic syndrome.\nCONCLUSION: Regular administration of  CECT 30632 reduced serum urate levels, the number of gout episodes and the pharmacological therapy required to control both hyperuricemia and gout episodes in individuals with a history of hyperuricemia and suffering from repeated episodes of gout.",

        "Abstract":"Xanthine oxidase (XO) is an important source of reactive oxygen species. This study investigated whether XO inhibition exerts renoprotective effects by inhibiting vascular endothelial growth factor (VEGF) and NADPH oxidase (NOX) in diabetic kidney disease (DKD). Febuxostat (5 mg\/kg) was administered to streptozotocin (STZ)-treated 8-week-old male C57BL\/6 mice via intraperitoneal injection for 8 weeks. The cytoprotective effects, its mechanism of XO inhibition, and usage of high-glucose (HG)-treated cultured human glomerular endothelial cells (GECs) were also investigated. Serum cystatin C, urine albumin\/creatinine ratio, and mesangial area expansion were significantly improved in febuxostat-treated DKD mice. Febuxostat reduced serum uric acid, kidney XO levels, and xanthine dehydrogenase levels. Febuxostat suppressed the expression of VEGF mRNA, VEGF receptor (VEGFR)1 and VEGFR3, NOX1, NOX2, and NOX4, and mRNA levels of their catalytic subunits. Febuxostat caused downregulation of Akt phosphorylation, followed by the enhancement of dephosphorylation of transcription factor forkhead box O3a (FoxO3a) and the activation of endothelial nitric oxide synthase (eNOS). In an in vitro study, the antioxidant effects of febuxostat were abolished by a blockade of VEGFR1 or VEGFR3 via NOX-FoxO3a-eNOS signaling in HG-treated cultured human GECs. XO inhibition attenuated DKD by ameliorating oxidative stress through the inhibition of the VEGF\/VEGFR axis. This was associated with NOX-FoxO3a-eNOS signaling.",

The Jiangniaosuan formulation (JNSF) is a Chinese herbal medicine treatment. The aim of this study is to evaluate its efficacy and safety among patients with hyperuricemic nephropathy at chronic kidney disease (CKD) stages 3-4 and with obstruction of phlegm turbidity and blood stasis syndrome.\nMETHODS: Our research is designed as a single-centre, double-blinded, randomized, placebo-controlled trial for 118 patients diagnosed with hyperuricemic nephropathy at CKD stages 3-4 and with obstruction of phlegm turbidity and blood stasis syndrome in mainland China. Patients are to be randomized into two groups: either the intervention group which receives JNSF 20.4 g\/day combined with febuxostat 20-40 mg\/day, or the control group which receives JNSF placebo 20.4 g\/day combined with febuxostat 20-40 mg\/day. The intervention will be carried on for 24 weeks. The change in estimated glomerular filtration rate (eGFR) is set as the primary outcome. Secondary outcomes include changes in serum uric acid, serum nitric oxide, urinary albumin\/creatinine ratio, urinary -acetyl-β-D glucosaminidase, urinary β2 microglobulin, urinary retinol binding protein and TCM syndromes in 24 weeks. Statistical analysis will be formulated by SPSS 24.0.\nDISCUSSION: The trial will conduce to the comprehensive assessment in the efficacy and safety of JNSF among patients diagnosed with hyperuricemic nephropathy at CKD stages 3-4, and provide a clinical method available on systems of the combination of modern medicine and TCM.",

Within the recent two months, two patients with heart failure develop febuxostat-induced acute liver injury during hospital stay. To the best of our knowledge, very few cases of febuxostat-induced hepatotoxicity have been reported up to now. In this paper, two unusual cases of febuxostat-induced acute liver injury are herein described. The medical history, drug treatment, clinical symptoms, liver function tests, diagnosis and prognosis are fully given in this paper. It should be noticed that, two liver injury happen in patients of heart failure with reduced ejection fraction. Whether heart failure is a risk factor of febuxostat related liver injury, deserves further research. This paper reminds the clinicians that more attention should be paid to the acute liver injury caused by febuxostat, and liver function tests are suggested especially for patients of heart failure.",

        "Abstract":"Epidemiological studies have shown that people having hyperuricemia are at increased risk of ischemic cerebrovascular disease. This research aimed to study the relation of ischemic cerebrovascular disease with benzbromarone use among persons with gout-related disorders. This was a retrospective cohort design utilizing a 2003 to 2015 national health insurance database in Taiwan. Subjects aged 20 to 99 years who already had suffered from gout-related disorders were included as eligible subjects. Eligible persons who had the benzbromarone prescription alone were selected into the benzbromarone group. Sex-matched and age-matched eligible persons who never used any urate-lowering agents were selected into the control group. An index date was set as a date of benzbromarone being prescribed. The end-point was defined as ischemic cerebrovascular disease being newly diagnosed. A hazard ratio was applied to measure the association strength between benzbromarone use and ischemic cerebrovascular disease. Totally, there were 13,398 persons in the benzbromarone group and 13,398 persons in the control group. The incidence rate of ischemic cerebrovascular disease seemed to be modestly higher in the benzbromarone group than the control group, but it did not achieve statistical significance (0.78 vs 0.75 every 100 person-years, incidence rate ratio = 1.05, 95% confidence interval = 0.94-1.16). A crude hazard ratio of ischemic cerebrovascular disease showed 1.05 in the benzbromarone group (95% confidence interval = 0.94-1.17, P = .373) comparing with the control group. No significant association can be detected between benzbromarone use and the probability of ischemic cerebrovascular disease among persons with gout-related disorders. We think that reduction of the serum uric acid by use of benzbromarone could not be related to the probability of ischemic cerebrovascular disease.

Although evidence of vitamin C's effectiveness as a treatment for gout is mixed, analysis of therapeutic benefit based on an individual's multiomic signature may identify predictive markers of treatment success.\nOBJECTIVES: The primary objective of the Hmong Microbiome ANd Gout, Obesity, Vitamin C (HMANGO-C) study was to assess the effectiveness of vitamin C on serum urate in Hmong adults with and without gout\/hyperuricemia. The secondary objectives were to assess if 1) vitamin C impacts the taxonomic and functional patterns of microbiota; 2) taxonomic and functional patterns of microbiota impact vitamin C's urate-lowering effects; 3) genetic variations impact vitamin C's urate-lowering effects; 4) differential microbial biomarkers exist for patients with or without gout; and 5) there is an association between obesity, gut microbiota and gout\/hyperuricemia.\nMETHODS: This prospective open-labelled clinical trial was guided by community-based participatory research principles and conducted under research safety restrictions for SARS-CoV-2. We aimed to enroll a convenient sample of 180 Hmong adults (120 with gout\/hyperuricemia and 60 without gout\/hyperuricemia) who provided medical, demographic, dietary and anthropometric information. Participants took vitamin C 500mg twice daily for 8 weeks and provided pre-and post- samples of blood and urine for urate measurements as well as stool samples for gut microbiome. Salivary DNA was also collected for genetic markers relevant to uric acid disposition.\nEXPECTED RESULTS: We expected to quantify the impact of vitamin C on serum urate in Hmong adults with and without gout\/hyperuricemia. The outcome will enhance our understanding of how gut microbiome and genomic variants impact the urate-lowering of vitamin C and associations between obesity, gut microbiota and gout\/hyperuricemia. Ultimately, findings may improve our understanding of the causes and potential interventions that could be used to address health disparities in the prevalence and management of gout in this underserved population.\nTRIAL REGISTRATION: ClinicalTrials.gov NCT04938024 (first posted: 06\/24\/2021).",

        "Published":"2023-01-11",
        "Abstract":"BACKGROUND: Dotinurad is a novel uricosuric drug in Japan with selective and potent urate transporter 1 (URAT1) inhibitory activity. This study aims to evaluate the efficacy and safety of dotinurad in hyperuricemic patients with type 2 diabetic kidney disease by comparing serum levels of urate and plasma and urinary levels of indoxyl sulfate excreted  the urate excretion transporter ATP binding cassette subfamily G member 2 (ABCG2), as indices, with baseline levels after switching from febuxostat to dotinurad.\nMETHODS: This single-center, single-arm, open-label, prospective, exploratory study aims to evaluate the effect of switching from febuxostat to dotinurad on serum urate levels and its background factors. The study will include 50 hyperuricemic patients with type 2 diabetic kidney disease and urate levels exceeding 6 mg\/dL despite administration of febuxostat 20 mg\/day for at least 3 months. The primary outcome is the achievement rate of serum urate levels of ≤6 mg\/dL after 24 weeks of treatment with dotinurad at 0.5 mg to a maximum of 4 mg once daily. Secondary outcomes include the changes in serum urate levels, plasma and urinary indoxyl sulfate levels, and renal injury-related markers from baseline to observation points at weeks 4, 12, and 24.\nDISCUSSION: The study hypothesizes that switching to dotinurad may reduce the plasma levels of indoxyl sulfate and increase its urinary levels in patients with hyperuricemia. These suggest that dotinurad can potently lower the serum urate level by inhibiting URAT1 without adversely affecting ABCG2. Thus, findings of this study are expected to provide useful insights into the treatment of hyperuricemia associated with type 2 diabetic kidney disease and the discovery of new possibilities for dotinurad.\nETHICS AND DISSEMINATION: Prior to the study, its study protocol was scientifically and ethically reviewed and approved by the Japan Physicians Association Clinical Research Review Board (approval number: JPA007-2204-02).

        "Abstract":"Individuals of Asian descent are at higher risk for developing hyperuricemia and gout as compared to Western populations. Urate-lowering therapy (ULT) is an effective treatment for hyperuricemia and gout. It was reported that febuxostat, one of the ULTs, raises the risk of atrial fibrillation (AF) in elderly populations. Nevertheless, this association has not been properly investigated in Asian populations. We aimed to investigate the development of AF after ULT with different drugs in an Asian population. We conducted a retrospective cohort study using the clinical database at Kaohsiung Veterans General Hospital. Patients newly diagnosed with gout between 1 January 2013 and 31 December 2020 and with a documented baseline serum uric acid (sUA) level but no prior diagnosis of AF were identified. Patients were divided into three groups-allopurinol, benzbromarone, and febuxostat users. During the follow-up period, the risks of incident AF following the initiation of ULT with different drugs were assessed. Development of incident AF was noted in 43 (6%) of the 713 eligible patients during the follow-up period (mean, 49.4 ± 26.6 months). Febuxostat-treated patients had a higher prevalence of certain comorbidities (diabetes mellitus, heart failure, and chronic kidney disease) and higher CHA2DS2-VASc scores. Compared with allopurinol, neither febuxostat nor benzbromarone was associated with increased adjusted hazard ratios (HR) for incident AF (HR: 1.20, 95% confidence interval [CI]: 0.43-3.34; HR: 0.68, 95% CI: 0.22-2.08). There was no difference in the risk of incident AF among Asian patients with gout who received febuxostat, allopurinol, or benzbromarone.

The chromatographic parameter of lipophilicity (R) of tested compounds was determined on three stationary phases, i.e., RP18F, RP18WF and RP2F, using ethanol-water, propan-2-ol-water and acetonitrile-water in various volume compositions as mobile phases. The chromatographic analysis led to determining the experimental value of the lipophilicity parameter for each of the tested compounds, including those for which the experimental value of the partition coefficient (logP) as a measure of lipophilicity is not well described in available databases, such as febuxostat, oxypurinol, ailanthone, abiraterone and teriflunomide. The chromatographic parameters of lipophilicity were compared with the logP values obtained with various software packages, such as AClogP, AlogPs, AlogP, MlogP, XlogP2, XlogP3, ACD\/logP and logP. The obtained results indicate that, among selected chromatographic parameters of lipophilicity, both experimental and calculated logP values gave similar results, and these RP-TLC or RP-HPTLC systems can be successfully applied to estimate the lipophilicity of studied heterocyclic compounds belonging to two different pharmacological groups. This work also illustrates the similarity and difference existing between the tested compounds under study using the chemometric methods, such as principal component analysis (PCA) and cluster analysis (CA). In addition, a relatively new approach based on the sum of ranking differences (SRD) was used to compare the chromatographically obtained and theoretical lipophilicity descriptors of studied compounds.",

This study sought to understand the facilitators and barriers to allopurinol adherence across the three stages of medication adherence, and patient perspectives on strategies to improve adherence, including self-monitoring urate concentration.\nMETHODS: Semi-structured interviews were conducted with 26 people with gout, previously or currently taking allopurinol. De-identified verbatim transcripts were thematically analysed using an inductive and deductive approach.\nRESULTS: Facilitators of adherence during allopurinol initiation were motivation to prevent gout flares and trust in the advice of their healthcare professionals (HCPs). Reluctance to commence long-term medication was a barrier to allopurinol initiation. Believing in the effectiveness and necessity of allopurinol and reminder systems were facilitators of implementation. Barriers to implementation included forgetfulness, gout flares and limited feedback on allopurinol's effectiveness. Patients discontinued therapy when allopurinol was perceived as ineffective or unnecessary. Discontinuation coincided with patients experiencing gout flares while adhering to allopurinol and receiving suboptimal advice about gout management. Patients identified receiving accurate advice from HCPs and regular urate monitoring for feedback on allopurinol's effectiveness as potential strategies to improve adherence. Perceived benefits of self-monitoring urate as a strategy to promote adherence included the ability to self-manage gout and make informed decisions about allopurinol therapy with their HCP.\nCONCLUSION: Patient perceptions of the effectiveness and necessity of allopurinol influenced intentional adherence during medication initiation, implementation and discontinuation. Strategies that inform patients of their urate control and provide accurate medical advice have the potential to improve adherence to allopurinol.",

        "Abstract":"OBJECTIVE: The gouty tophus is an organized structure composed of monosodium urate (MSU) crystals and chronic inflammatory soft tissue. This dual-energy computed tomography (DECT) study aimed to determine whether the composition of the tophus changes during urate-lowering therapy.\nMETHODS: Serial DECT scans from 32 people with gout were obtained over 2 years of allopurinol therapy, dose-escalated to serum urate of <0.36 mmoles\/liter. Up to 5 index tophi were selected for each patient, with 103 separate tophi included in the analysis. Using manual outlining methods of conventional CT and DECT scans, the same index tophi were serially measured for total tophus volume and urate volume. For each tophus, the soft tissue volume was then calculated by subtracting the urate volume from the total tophus volume.\nRESULTS: The mean ± SD serum urate reduced from 0.43 ± 0.03 mmoles\/liter at baseline to 0.31 ± 0.02 mmoles\/liter at year 2. The mean ± SD total tophus volume reduced over the 2-year period from 5.17 ± 5.55 cm to 2.61 ± 2.73 cm (P < 0.0001). Greater reductions in tophus urate volumes than tophus soft tissue volumes were observed; the tophus urate volume decreased by 70.6%, and tophus soft tissue volume decreased by 37.8% (P < 0.0001). The mean tophus urate:soft tissue ratio reduced from 0.15 at baseline to 0.05 at year 2 (P < 0.001).\nCONCLUSION: The composition of the tophus is dynamic and changes during urate-lowering therapy for gout management. The soft tissue component of the tophus is slower to respond and may persist without measurable MSU crystal deposition.",

        "Abstract":"BACKGROUND: Uncontrolled\/refractory gout patients are recalcitrant\/intolerant to oral urate-lowering therapies (ULTs), experiencing frequent gout flares, functionally limiting tophi, and low quality of life. Pegloticase lowers urate, but anti-pegloticase antibodies limit urate-lowering efficacy and increase infusion reaction (IR) risk. Immunomodulator + pegloticase co-administration may improve treatment response rates, with 79% of MIRROR open-label trial (MIRROR-OL, pegloticase + oral methotrexate) participants meeting 6-month response criteria. Exploratory outcomes from MIRROR-OL are described here.\nMETHODS: Adults with uncontrolled gout (serum urate [SU] ≥ 6 mg\/dL and ULT-intolerance\/recalcitrance or functionally limiting tophi) were included. Oral methotrexate (15 mg\/week) was administered 4 weeks before and during pegloticase treatment (biweekly 8 mg infusion, ≤ 52 weeks). Exploratory outcomes included change from baseline (CFB) in number of affected joints, Health Assessment Questionnaires (HAQs), and Gout Global Assessments.\nRESULTS: Fourteen patients received ≥ 1 pegloticase infusion, with 13 included in 52-week analyses (1 enrolled before treatment-extension amendment, exited at 24 weeks). Three patients prematurely exited due to SU rise; 10 completed 52-week evaluations (8 completed 52 weeks of co-therapy, 2 completed 24 weeks [met treatment goals]). At 52 weeks, SU averaged 1.1 ± 2.5 mg\/dL, with improvements in HAQ pain and health (CFB: - 33.6 and - 0.7, respectively), Patient and Physician Global Assessments (CFB: - 4.6 and - 5.7, respectively), and joint involvement (CFB: - 5.6, - 8.4, - 6.0 tender, swollen, tophi-affected joints, respectively). Two patients underwent dual-energy computed tomography, showing concomitant monosodium urate volume reductions. All patients had ≥ 1 AE, with 92.9% experiencing acute flare. One mild IR (\"cough\") occurred and no new safety signals were identified.\nCONCLUSION: Pegloticase + methotrexate co-therapy resulted in sustained SU-lowering with meaningful improvements in clinical measures, urate burden, and patient-reported outcomes.\nTRIAL REGISTRATION: ClinicalTrials.gov (NCT03635957).",

        "Abstract":"We describe a case of chronic tophaceous gout affecting the spine, hands, elbows, feet, and knees in a 67-year-old man with serum urate levels at 549 µmol\/L whose response to treatment was successfully mapped using dual-energy computed tomography (DECT). The patient presented with exacerbation of acute-on-chronic lumbar back pain. He had received a diagnosis of gout 3 years prior to this presentation yet was not on any urate-lowering therapy. The patient received febuxostat 80 mg and colchicine 0.3 mg once daily and underwent DECT to assess baseline monosodium urate (MSU) burden. At baseline, MSU deposits were seen in the hands, elbows, feet, knees, and lumbar spine including the left L5-S1 facet joint encroaching onto the neural foramen. After 2.5 years of treatment, serum urate level was within the target range (< 360 µmol\/L), and the patient underwent a follow-up DECT that revealed almost full resolution of MSU deposition in the spine, including the MSU-burdened facet joint and neural foramen in the lumbar spine, in addition to all the affected peripheral joints. This case is the first report of radiological evidence of nearly complete resolution of MSU deposits in spinal gout on DECT after urate-lowering therapy treatment, which demonstrates the utility of this imaging modality as a non-invasive investigational point-of-care imaging modality for mapping treatment response and identifying the etiology of back pain in a patient with chronic tophaceous spinal gout.",

        "Abstract":"Although an association of serum uric acid levels with endothelial function has been shown in various clinical settings, the optimal treatment target that would benefit vascular endothelial function has not been established. We, therefore, conducted a post hoc analysis of the Excited-UA study to identify an optimal target. Patients (N = 133) with chronic heart failure and comorbid hyperuricemia who enrolled in the Excited-UA study were divided into three tertiles based on their serum uric acid level 24 weeks after initiating xanthine oxidase inhibitor treatment with topiroxostat or allopurinol (i.e., groups with low, moderate, and high uric acid levels). Flow-mediated dilation (FMD) and reactive hyperemia index (RHI) values measured by reactive hyperemia peripheral arterial tonometry (RH-PAT) were compared among groups. The change from baseline in the FMD value 24 weeks after treatment was comparable among the three groups. In contrast, the change from baseline in the RHI was significantly different among the three groups (-0.153 ± 0.073, 0.141 ± 0.081 and -0.103 ± 0.104 in the low, moderate, and high uric acid level groups, respectively, P = 0.032). After adjustment for age, body mass index, and concomitant use of diuretics, which differed among the three groups, the change in the RHI in the moderate uric acid level group tended to be higher than that in the high uric acid level group (P = 0.057) and was significantly higher than that in the low uric acid level group (P = 0.020). These results indicate that targeting excessively low uric acid levels by treatment with xanthine oxidase inhibitors might be less beneficial for improving microvascular endothelial function in patients with chronic heart failure. Comparisons of the changes from baseline in vascular endothelial function parameters at 24 weeks among the 3 groups of low, moderae and high uric acid levels achieved with xanthine oxidase inhibitors. After adjustment for confounding factors, such as age, body mass index and concomitant diuretic use, which showed differences among the 3 groups, the change in RHI in the moderate uric acid level group tended to be higher than that in the high uric acid level group and was significantly higher than that in the low uric acid level group.",

        "Abstract":"BACKGROUND: A few studies have tested febuxostat for its usefulness in delaying chronic kidney disease (CKD) progression by treating hyperuricemia and results were controversial. Thus, we attempted to conduct a randomized controlled study using the Chinese population with advanced grade of CKD.\nMETHODS: One hundred CKD patients in stages 3 and 4 with asymptomatic hyperuricemia from seven medical centers were included in this prospective randomized controlled study and assigned to the control and febuxostat group, the latter of which received febuxostat to titrate to achieve serum uric acid (SUA) < 6 mg\/dL. The observation period was 12 months. The primary outcomes included the event of estimated glomerular filtration rate (eGFR) decline ≥ 30% or 50% from baseline at 12 months, dialysis and death from CKD; secondary outcome was the change in eGFR. Safety analysis was also performed.\nRESULTS: Forty-seven patients and 45 patients in the febuxostat and control groups, respectively completed the study. Seven of 47 (14.9%) participants reached 30% decline in eGFR in the febuxostat group, while 1 (2.1%) and 2 (4.3%) patients reached 50% decline in eGFR or dialysis. Thirteen (28.9%), 10 (22.2%) and 3 (6.7%) of 45 patients reached primary kidney outcomes separately in the control group. The change in eGFR after 12 months from baseline in the febuxostat group was 0.50 mL\/min\/1.73 m, which was significantly higher than that in the control group - 4.46 mL\/min\/1.73 m (p = 0.006). Adverse events did not differ between two groups.\nCONCLUSIONS: Febuxostat effectively slowed eGFR decline in patients with CKD stages 3 and 4 and asymptomatic hyperuricemia.",

        "Abstract":"['2', 'm', '2', '2']\nK\nBiological enzymes have high catalytic activity and unique substrate selectivity; their immobilization may provide cost reduction and reusability. Using magnetic nanoparticles (MNPs) as support materials for enzymes ensures easy separation from reaction media by an external magnetic field. Thus, MNPs were prepared by the coprecipitation method, coated with silanol groups, then -NH-functionalized, and finally activated with glutaraldehyde. Finally, three different oxidase enzymes, i.e., uricase, glucose oxidase, and choline oxidase, were separately immobilized on their surfaces by covalent attachment. Hence, colorimetric nanobiosensors for the determination of three biologically important substrates, i.e., uric acid (UA), glucose (Glu), and choline (Ch), were developed. Hydrogen peroxide liberated from enzyme-substrate reactions was determined by the cupric ion reducing antioxidant capacity (CUPRAC) reagent, bis-neocuproine copper(II) chelate. In addition, UA-free total antioxidant capacity could also be measured via the developed system. Kinetic investigations were carried out for these nanobiosensors to enable the calculation of their Michaelis constants ( ), revealing no affinity loss for the substrate as a result of immobilization. Enzyme-immobilized MNPs could be reused at least five times. The linear concentration ranges were 5.43-65.22 μM for UA, 11.1-111.1 μM for Glu, and 2.78-44.4 μM for Ch, and the limit of detection (LOD) values with the same order were 0.34, 0.59, and 0.20 μM, respectively. Besides phenolic and thiol-type antioxidants, UA could be determined with an error range of 0.18-4.87%. The method is based on a clear redox reaction with a definite stoichiometry for the enzymatically generated HO (which minimizes chemical deviations from Beer's law of optical absorbances), and it was successfully applied to the determination of Glu and UA in fetal bovine serum and Ch in infant formula as real samples.",

        "Abstract":"AIM: This thorough QT\/QTc (TQT) study was conducted to evaluate the risk of QT prolongation for verinurad when combined with allopurinol. Verinurad is a novel, urate anion exchanger 1 inhibitor that reduces serum urate levels by promoting urinary excretion of uric acid. It is co-administered with a xanthine oxidase inhibitor.\nMETHODS: The TQT study (NCT04256629) was a randomized, placebo-controlled, double-blind, three-period, crossover study, conducted in healthy volunteers. A total of 24 participants received single doses of verinurad 24 mg extended release, 40 mg immediate release formulation (both co-administered with allopurinol 300 mg), and matching placebos. The primary endpoint was baseline- and placebo-adjusted Fridericia-corrected QTcF interval (ΔΔQTcF) at the concentration of interest. A prespecified linear mixed-effects concentration-QTc model was used to estimate the primary endpoint. Time-matched 12-lead digital electrocardiograms and plasma concentrations were measured at baseline and up to 48 h after dose in each participant.\nRESULTS: Estimated ΔΔQTcF at the highest clinically relevant scenario (76 ng\/mL) was -2.7 msec (90% confidence interval [CI]: -4.6, -0.8). Furthermore, the upper 90% ΔΔQTcF CI was estimated to be below 10 msec at all observed verinurad concentrations. Supratherapeutic verinurad dose was used to achieve exposures eightfold higher than the highest clinically relevant exposure, thus waiving the need for positive control.\nCONCLUSIONS: As the effect on ΔΔQTcF was below the threshold for regulatory concern (10 msec) at the supratherapeutic exposure, it can be concluded that verinurad and allopurinol treatment does not induce QTcF prolongation at the highest clinically relevant exposures.",

        "Abstract":"Hyperuricemia is a metabolic disease caused by the accumulation of uric acid in the body. Allopurinol, benzbromarone, and febuxostat, which are available in the market, have reduced the circulating urate levels; however, they exhibit serious side effects. Therefore, it is reasonable to develop a new active antihyperuricemia drug with few side effects. With the deepening of research, numerous kinds of literature have shown that natural active substances are effective in the treatment of hyperuricemia with a variety of sources and few side effects, which have become the focus of research in recent years. This review focuses on natural active substances with uric-acid-reducing activity and discusses their pharmacological effects. More specifically, the bioactive compounds of natural active substances are divided into five categories: natural extracts, monomer compounds extracted from plants, natural protease hydrolysates, peptides, and probiotic bacteria. In addition, the mechanisms by which these bioactive compounds exhibit hypouricemic effects can be divided into four classes: inhibition of key enzyme activities, promotion of uric acid excretion and inhibition of reabsorption in the kidney, promotion of decomposing uric acid precursors, and promotion of decomposing uric acid. Overall, this current and comprehensive review examines the role of natural active substances in the treatment of hyperuricemia.",

We analyzed and compared the associated risk of ED in gout patients who started taking allopurinol or febuxostat within 12 months. Propensity score matching was performed to adjust for demographic variables, comorbidities, and medication use. Kaplan-Meier analysis was used to estimate the probability of the outcome of interest. The hazard ratio (HR) and associated confidence intervals were calculated along with the proportionality test using R's Survival Package v3.2-3.\nRESULTS: We identified 679,862 patients with gout among 107,517,445 patients in the database. Of these patients, 24,000 were treated with febuxostat and 299,726 with allopurinol. After propensity matching, 9075 patients receiving febuxostat without allopurinol (febuxostat group) and 9075 corresponding patients receiving allopurinol without febuxostat (allopurinol group) were analyzed for comparison. Among all male patients over 19 years of age, febuxostat was associated with a significantly higher risk of ED versus allopurinol (HR 1.354; 95% confidence interval (CI) 1.003-1.829; log rank test, p = 0.047). After subgroup analysis, in gout patients aged 19-64 years, a significantly higher incidence of ED was observed in the febuxostat group than in the allopurinol group (HR 2.002, 95% CI 1.282-3.126). The risk of ED did not differ significantly between the allopurinol and febuxostat groups in gout patients older than 65 years.\nCONCLUSIONS: Febuxostat may be associated with a higher risk of ED than allopurinol in adult male patients with gout.

        "Published":"2022-11-28",
        "Abstract":"Gout is the most common inflammatory arthritis in adults. The prevalence of gout increases with age. Urate-lowering treatment (ULT) among older patients is often challenging in that patients frequently suffer insufficient effectiveness or adverse events due to comorbidities, concurrent medications, and altered pharmacokinetics. The large-scale randomized controlled trials (RCTs) directly investigating gout patients regarding cardiovascular (CV) safety have only recently been introduced; CARES and FAST compared the CV safety of the two xanthine oxidase inhibitors (XOis), febuxostat versus allopurinol, in patients with gout. Based on the CARES trial that showed CV concerns with febuxostat, the current international guidelines recommend allopurinol as first-line ULT in gout, while preserving other agents as a second-line treatment, despite a higher potency of febuxostat. XOis would be more suitable than uricosurics to treat older patients with gout due to the high prevalence of chronic kidney disease (CKD) in older patients. However, allopurinol alone might not achieve the target serum uric acid levels below 6 mg\/dL and CKD might confer an increased risk of allopurinol induced cutaneous adverse reactions in older patients. Furthermore, as well as the later analysis of CARES participants who were lost to follow-up, data from the FAST trial and real-world studies suggest non-inferior CV safety for febuxostat compared to allopurinol even in the presence of CV diseases. Thus, febuxostat use in older patients with renal impairment may be more positively considered. The combination therapy of a novel uricosuric, verinurad, plus febuxostat reduced albuminuria in hyperuricemic patients with type 2 diabetes and CKD in a phase 2a trial, and further RCTs are awaited. Finally, the sodium-glucose cotransporter-2 inhibitor class of oral hypoglycemic agents, known to exert beneficial CV and renal effects independent of glycemic control, have shown a uricosuric effect and could be used as adjunctive therapy in older patients with cardiorenal comorbidities.",

Patients were divided into two groups; allopurinol users; (for gout or asymptomatic hyperuricemia) and a matching disease control group. Patient demographics, co-morbid conditions, biochemical tests, and pharmacological treatments were extracted from electronic records to investigate the effect of allopurinol therapy on Glycemic control (GC), as assessed by glycated haemoglobin (HbA1c as primary endpoint), and on parameters of glycaemic variability (GV) (secondary endpoints).\nRESULTS: A total of 194 patients with type 2 DM were recruited (97 in both groups). The two groups were matched for age, sex, and duration of DM: mean age: 59.4 years, 73% males, and 122 months in the allopurinol group vs 59.6 years, 73% males, and 113 months in the control group. Antidiabetic medications were matched between the two groups. In the allopurinol group, it was prescribed with a daily dose of 100 mg, for 77% of the patients, with median duration of 39.5 months.

        "Abstract":"WHAT IS KNOWN AND OBJECTIVE: The present study compared the efficacy and safety of low-dose febuxostat versus allopurinol in chronic kidney disease (CKD) patients complicated with hyperuricemia (HUA).\nMETHODS: In this double-centre, randomized, controlled study, 120 CKD patients complicated with HUA were recruited and randomly assigned to low-dose febuxostat group (20 mg\/day) or allopurinol group (200 mg\/day) at 1:1 ratio. The serum creatinine (Scr), serum uric acid (SUA), and estimated glomerular filtration rate (eGFR) were measured at baseline (M0), month (M) 1, M3, and M6. Besides, the drug-related adverse events (AEs) were recorded. The primary outcome was the proportion of patients showing a > 10% decline in eGFR from M0 to M6.\nRESULTS: The eGFR level was increased at M6, but similar at M0, M1 and M3 in febuxostat group compared with allopurinol group. Notably, the proportion of patients with >10% decline in eGFR from M0 to M6 was decreased in febuxostat group compared with allopurinol group. However, there was no difference of Scr, SUA at M0, M1, M3 and M6 between febuxostat group and allopurinol group. Moreover, there was no difference of drug-related AEs between febuxostat group and allopurinol group. Further subgroup analysis exhibited that low-dose febuxostat presented superior effect on attenuating eGFR decline and lowering SUA level compared with allopurinol in CKD stage 3 subgroup, but not in CKD stage 2 subgroup.\nCONCLUSION: Low-dose febuxostat may exhibit a superior renal-protective effect, non-inferior SUA lowering ability and safety profile compared with allopurinol in CKD patients complicated with HUA.",

        "Abstract":"The genetic determinants of the allopurinol dose-concentration relationship have not been extensively studied. We aimed to clarify what factors, including genetic variation in urate transporters, influence oxypurinol pharmacokinetics (PKs). A population PK model for oxypurinol was developed with NONMEM (version 7.3). The influence of urate transporter genetic variants for ABCG2 (rs2231142 and rs10011796), SLC2A9\/GLUT9 (rs11942223), SLC17A1\/NPT1 (rs1183201), SLC22A12\/URAT1 (rs3825018), SLC22A11\/OAT4 (rs17300741), and ABCC4\/MRP4 (rs4148500), as well as other participant factors on oxypurinol PKs was assessed. Data from 325 people with gout were available. The presence of the T allele for ABCG2 (rs2231142) and SLC17A1\/NPT1 (rs1183201) was associated with a 24% and 22% increase in oxypurinol clearance, respectively, in univariate analysis. This effect was not significant in the multivariate analysis. In the final model, oxypurinol PKs were predicted by creatinine clearance, diuretic use, ethnicity, and body weight. We have found that genetic variability in the transporters examined does not appear to influence oxypurinol PKs.",

Factors associated with gout flare and hospital length of stay were explored.\nMETHODS: This retrospective cohort study included adults with comorbid gout who were hospitalized for PCR-confirmed COVID-19 between March 2020 and December 2021 in 3 hospitals in Thailand. Prevalence, characteristics, and outcomes of gout flare were described. Factors associated with gout flare were explored using least absolute shrinkage and selection operator selection and multivariate logistic regression. The association between gout flare and hospital length of stay was explored using multivariate linear regression.\nRESULTS: Among 8697 patients hospitalized for COVID-19, 146 patients with comorbid gout were identified and gout flare occurred in 26 (18%). Compared to those without flare, patients with gout flare had higher baseline serum urate and lower prevalence of use of urate-lowering therapy (ULT) and gout flare prophylaxis medications. One-third of gout flare episodes were treated with ≥ 2 antiinflammatory medications. Logistic regression identified GOUT-36 rule ≥ 2, a predictive index for inpatient gout flare, as the only factor associated with gout flare (odds ratio 5.46, 95% CI 1.18-25.37). Gout flare was found to be independently associated with hospital length of stay and added 3 days to hospital course.\nCONCLUSION: Gout flare occurred in 18% of patients with comorbid gout hospitalized for COVID-19 and added up to 3 days to hospital length of stay.

        "Abstract":"With increased unhealthy dietary patterns and a sedentary lifestyle, the prevalence of hyperuricemia is growing rapidly, placing a tremendous burden on the public health system. Persistent hyperuricemia in extreme cases induces gout, gouty arthritis, and other metabolic diseases. Benzbromarone is a potent human urate transporter 1 (URAT1) inhibitor that is widely used as a uric acid-lowering drug. Recent studies indicated that benzbromarone can also activate farnesoid X receptor (FXR), whereas its agonistic activity on FXR is rather poor. Mounting evidence suggested that the etiology of gout is directly related to NOD-like receptor thermal protein domain associated protein 3 (NLRP3) inflammasomes, and FXR suppresses the expression of NLRP3 in various ways. Therefore, the dual URAT1 inhibitor and FXR agonist may exert synergistic effects on decreasing uric acid (UA) levels and inhibiting inflammation. To obtain a better dual URAT1 inhibitor and FXR agonist, we performed the structure-based drug design (SBDD) strategy to improve the FXR activation of benzbromarone by forming strong interactions with ARG331 in FXR binding pocket. All of these efforts lead to the identification of compound 4, which exerts better activity on FXR and uric acid-lowering effect than benzbromarone.",

The study aimed to comparatively analyze the risk of cardiovascular disease associated with febuxostat and allopurinol use in Korean patients with gout. A cohort study was conducted using national insurance claim data from the Health Insurance Review and Assessment Service (HIRA). Adult patients who were diagnosed with gout and prescribed febuxostat or allopurinol more than once from July 1, 2015, to June 30, 2018 were studied. The outcome was cardiovascular disease.

        "Abstract":"BACKGROUND: Depression is a psychiatric disorder characterized by low mood and loss of interest in daily activities. Allopurinol, a xanthine oxidase blocker, is widely administered for the treatment of hyperuricemia. Recently, its effects on serotonin and depressive like behaviors have been reported. On the other hand, the level of brain-derived neurotrophic factor (BDNF), a protective and regenerative neurotrophic, has been increased by many antidepressants. The purpose of this study was to evaluate the antidepressant effects of allopurinol and changes in serum level of BDNF compared to those of fluoxetine.\nMETHODS: Thirty-five male Wistar albino rats divided into five groups (control, 10 mg\/kg fluoxetine, 25, 50 and 100 mg\/kg allopurinol; n = 7 per group), that received all treatments intraperitoneally, every day. Forced swimming tests (FST), tail suspension test (TST) and open field test (OFT) were performed after 21 days of drug administration. Finally, the serum BDNF levels were measured using the sandwich ELISA method.\nRESULTS: All doses of allopurinol and fluoxetine reduced the duration of immobility time in FST and TST. No significant changes were observed in the number of lines crossed in OFT between either allopurinol or fluoxetine groups and control group. Serum level of BDNF were significantly higher in fluoxetine and allopurinol 50 and 100 mg\/kg groups.\nCONCLUSIONS: Long-term administration of allopurinol 50 and 100 mg\/kg have shown antidepressant effects in behavioral tests along with an increase in the amount of serum BDNF concentration. The OFT results suggested that allopurinol did not have any significant effects on motor activity. The increased serum level of the BDNF in the allopurinol group was correlated with FST and TST results. However, it is still not clear whether the antidepressant effects of allopurinol are due to a direct effects on serotonin and\/or BDNF or an indirect effect related to its xanthin oxidase inhibition.",

The 90%CIs of maximum plasma concentration was slightly outside the lower limit of bioequivalent criteria, with about 13.40% decrease in the fed versus fasted condition. The time to maximum concentration was slightly delayed under the fasted condition. A single 10-mg dose of SHR4640 was safe and well tolerated in this trial. The main pharmacokinetic parameters and serum uric acid lowering of SHR4640 were not affected by food effect; thus, SHR4640 can be recommended to be administered with or without food.",

We conducted an observational study with a cohort design using the National Database of Health Insurance Claims and Specific Health Checkups of Japan, including new urate-lowering drugs users between August 1, 2010, and March 31, 2018. Exposure and control groups were defined based on the first prescription of urate-lowering drugs as follows: febuxostat or topiroxostat for exposure groups, allopurinol for the control group, and benzbromarone for the secondary control group. The primary outcome was cardiovascular events, defined as a composite of acute coronary syndrome, cerebral infarction, and cerebral hemorrhage. Hazard ratios were estimated using a Cox proportional hazards model. The number of patients in each exposure and control group was 1,357,671 in the febuxostat group, 83,683 in the topiroxostat group, 1,273,211 in the allopurinol group, and 258,786 in the benzbromarone group.

The benzbromarone group exhibited similar results. No increased cardiovascular risk was observed with febuxostat or topiroxostat when compared with allopurinol in patients with hyperuricemia in Japan. These results provide real-world evidence regarding the cardiovascular risk associated with urate-lowering drugs, indicating that no additional safety-related regulatory actions are warranted in Japan.",

        "Abstract":"A gout attack may evolve after a purine-rich diet or alcohol and after starting urate-lowering therapy (ULT). The relationships between fluctuation and change in serum urate (SU) with the occurrence of flares were investigated in this study. In the prospective NOR-Gout study, gout patients with increased SU and a recent flare were treated to target with ULT over 1 year, with follow-up at year 2 with SU and flare as outcomes. SU and flares were assessed at both monthly and 3-monthly intervals until target SU was reached. Fluctuation over periods and changes in SU between two time points were assessed and compared in patients with and without flares. At year 1, 186 patients completed follow-up (88.2%) and 173 (82.0%) at year 2. Mean age (SD) at baseline was 56.4 (13.7) years, disease duration was 7.8 (7.6) years, and 95.3% were men. The first-year SU fluctuation and change were related to flare occurrence during year 1 (both p < 0.05). High fluctuation with an absolute sum of all SU changes during the first 9 months was related to flares over 3-month periods (all p < 0.05), and high fluctuation during the first 3 months was related to flares in months 3-6 (p = 0.04). Monthly and high SU changes or again reaching higher SU levels > 360 µmol\/l were not related to flares. Fluctuation and change in SU were related to flare occurrence during the first year of ULT, while changes between visits and reaching SU levels > 360 µmol\/L were not related to flares. Key Points • Urate-lowering therapy seeks to achieve a treatment target and prevent gout flares, and changes in serum urate are related to gout flares. • Fluctuation and changes in serum urate were associated with gout flares, suggesting that fluctuation in serum urate is unfavourable during gout treatment. • During urate-lowering therapy in gout in clinical practice, fluctuation of serum urate, for example, due to lack of adherence, should be observed and avoided.",

Gout patients starting allopurinol during 2013-2015 versus 2016-2018 were compared regarding persistence and compliance with treat-to-target principles.\nRESULTS: The incidence of gout was 221-247 per 100 000 person-years during 2014-2019, prevalence in 2018 was 2.45%. Among prevalent cases, the proportion on allopurinol ranged from 21% to 25%.

Primary outcome was iGFR change over three years. Linear regression with backwards selection of baseline clinical variables was performed to identify an optimized model forecasting iGFR change. Furthermore, VVs of SBP, HbA, serum creatinine, and UA were calculated using measurements from the run-in period; thereafter assessed by linear regression, with iGFR change as the dependent variable.\nRESULTS: 404 participants were included in the primary analyses. In the optimized baseline variable model, higher HbA, SBP, iGFR, albuminuria, and heart rate, and mineralocorticoid receptor antagonist prescription were associated with greater iGFR decline. Higher VV of SBP was associated with greater iGFR decline (adjusted β (ml\/min\/1.73 m\/50 % increase): -0.79, p = 0.01).\nCONCLUSIONS: We identified several risk markers for faster iGFR decline in a high-risk population with type 1 diabetes.

Participants and physicians completed questionnaires rating their assessment of current gout control using a numerical rating scale (0 = not at all controlled, 10 = fully controlled). Discordance between patients' and physicians' scores was defined as an absolute difference of >2 units.\nRESULTS: The mean ± SD patient gout control score was 8.09 ± 2.24, and the physician gout control score was 7.38 ± 2.63 (P < 0.001 for comparison). Absence of gout flares in the last 12 months and in the last 3 months and serum urate at the treatment target (<6 mg\/dl) were associated with higher patient and physician gout control scores. Absence of tophus also predicted higher physician, but not patient, gout control scores. Discordant scores for gout control were present in 50 participants (22.3%), mostly due to lower assessment of disease control by physicians. Gout flare in the preceding 3 months (odds ratio [OR] 5.9, P < 0.001) and tophus (OR 3.1, P = 0.007) predicted discordant disease-control assessments in which physicians scored lower gout control than patients.\nCONCLUSION: For both patients and physicians, absence of gout flares and serum urate levels at the treatment target predict assessment of gout control.

        "Published":null,
        "Abstract":"BACKGROUND: Allopurinol is a urate-lowering therapy used to treat patients with gout. Previous studies have shown that allopurinol has positive effects on several cardiovascular parameters. The ALL-HEART study aimed to determine whether allopurinol therapy improves major cardiovascular outcomes in patients with ischaemic heart disease.\nMETHODS: ALL-HEART was a multicentre, prospective, randomised, open-label, blinded-endpoint trial done in 18 regional centres in England and Scotland, with patients recruited from 424 primary care practices. Eligible patients were aged 60 years or older, with ischaemic heart disease but no history of gout. Participants were randomly assigned (1:1), using a central web-based randomisation system accessed via a web-based application or an interactive voice response system, to receive oral allopurinol up-titrated to a dose of 600 mg daily (300 mg daily in participants with moderate renal impairment at baseline) or to continue usual care. The primary outcome was the composite cardiovascular endpoint of non-fatal myocardial infarction, non-fatal stroke, or cardiovascular death. The hazard ratio (allopurinol vs usual care) in a Cox proportional hazards model was assessed for superiority in a modified intention-to-treat analysis (excluding randomly assigned patients later found to have met one of the exclusion criteria). The safety analysis population included all patients in the modified intention-to-treat usual care group and those who took at least one dose of randomised medication in the allopurinol group. This study is registered with the EU Clinical Trials Register, EudraCT 2013-003559-39, and ISRCTN, ISRCTN32017426.\nFINDINGS: Between Feb 7, 2014, and Oct 2, 2017, 5937 participants were enrolled and then randomly assigned to receive allopurinol or usual care. After exclusion of 216 patients after randomisation, 5721 participants (mean age 72·0 years [SD 6·8], 4321 [75·5%] males, and 5676 [99·2%] white) were included in the modified intention-to-treat population, with 2853 in the allopurinol group and 2868 in the usual care group. Mean follow-up time in the study was 4·8 years (1·5). There was no evidence of a difference between the randomised treatment groups in the rates of the primary endpoint. 314 (11·0%) participants in the allopurinol group (2·47 events per 100 patient-years) and 325 (11·3%) in the usual care group (2·37 events per 100 patient-years) had a primary endpoint (hazard ratio [HR] 1·04 [95% CI 0·89-1·21], p=0·65). 288 (10·1%) participants in the allopurinol group and 303 (10·6%) participants in the usual care group died from any cause (HR 1·02 [95% CI 0·87-1·20], p=0·77).\nINTERPRETATION: In this large, randomised clinical trial in patients aged 60 years or older with ischaemic heart disease but no history of gout, there was no difference in the primary outcome of non-fatal myocardial infarction, non-fatal stroke, or cardiovascular death between participants randomised to allopurinol therapy and those randomised to usual care.\nFUNDING: UK National Institute for Health and Care Research.",

Although hyperuricemia has been associated with multiple CV complications, it is not officially recognized as a target parameter for CVD risk reduction.\nAIM: To systematically review the literature in order to determine whether treating hyperuricemia with allopurinol in patients with T2D reduces CVD risk.\nMETHODS: A thorough literature search in the PubMed, CENTRAL, and EMBASE databases from inception to August 2022 was performed. After application of selection criteria, 6 appropriate studies were identified.\nRESULTS: Detailed analysis of the data derived indicated that there is an association between allopurinol treatment and CV benefits, resulting in a reduced risk of CVD events and mortality rates. This association can be attributed mainly to the reduction of inflammation and oxidative burden, as well as to the improvement of glycemic and lipid profiles.\nCONCLUSIONS: This systematic review provides evidence that allopurinol may reduce CVD risk in patients with T2D. Randomized, placebo-controlled trials should be performed in order to confirm these findings and identify specific subgroups of patients who will benefit most.",

        "Abstract":"BACKGROUND: Topiroxostat, an inhibitor of xanthine oxidoreductase (XOR) was shown to reduce urinary albumin excretion of hyperuricemic patients with chronic kidney disease. However, its pharmacological mechanism is not well understood. In this study, we examined the effects of topiroxostat on glomerular podocytes. Podocyte is characterized by foot process and a unique cell-cell junction slit diaphragm functioning as a final barrier to prevent proteinuria.\nMETHODS: The effects of topiroxostat on the expressions of podocyte functional molecules were analysed in db\/db mice, a diabetic nephropathy model, anti-nephrin antibody-induced rat podocyte injury model and cultured podocytes treated with adriamycin.\nRESULTS: Topiroxostat treatment ameliorated albuminuria in db\/db mice. The expression of desmin, a podocyte injury marker was increased, and nephrin and podocin, key molecules of slit diaphragm, and podoplanin, an essential molecule in maintaining foot process were downregulated in db\/db mice. Topiroxostat treatment prevented the alterations in the expressions of these molecules in db\/db mice. XOR activity in kidney was increased in rats with anti-nephrin antibody-induced podocyte injury. Topiroxostat treatment reduced XOR activity and restored the decreased expression of nephrin, podocin and podoplanin in the podocyte injury. Furthermore, topiroxostat enhanced the expression of podoplanin in injured human cultured podocytes.\nCONCLUSIONS: Podocyte injury was evident in db\/db mice. Topiroxostat ameliorated albuminuria in diabetic nephropathy model by preventing podocyte injury. Increase of XOR activity in kidney contributes to development of podocyte injury caused by stimulation to slit diaphragm. Topiroxostat has an effect to stabilize slit diaphragm and foot processes by inhibiting the reduction of nephrin, podocin and podoplanin.",

Patients with HUA who underwent PD in Ningbo First Hospital from January 2018 to October 2021 were enrolled and divided into experimental group and control group according to whether to use febuxostat. The clinical baseline data before treatment and clinical indicators during 1-12 months after treatment were collected in two groups, and the adverse reactions during the use of febuxostat were also recorded. The changes of serum uric acid, standard-reaching rate and residual renal function were compared between the two groups during the follow-up.  A total of 105 patients were included in the study. There were 55 patients in the experimental group [27 males and 28 females, with a mean age of (54.5±14.8) years] and 50 patients in the control group [32 males and 18 females, with a mean age of (53.8±15.2) years].

As the mode of action of SHR4640 differs from that of a xanthine oxidase inhibitor, such as febuxostat, coadministration of these drugs may be a treatment option for patients with primary hyperuricemia. We assessed the potential drug-drug interaction between SHR4640 and febuxostat. In this single-center, open-label, randomized, drug-drug interaction study, subjects received 80 mg febuxostat or 10 mg SHR4640 alone daily in the first week, whereas during the second week a combination of SHR4640 and febuxostat was administered daily to all subjects. Plasma concentrations of SHR4640 and febuxostat were analyzed. We compared their pharmacokinetic and pharmacodynamic parameters and assessed both safety and tolerability. Compared with febuxostat alone, the geometric mean ratios (90%CIs) of the maximum concentration (C ) and the area under the plasma concentration-time curve over the dosing interval τ (AUC ) for febuxostat after coadministration were 1.284 (1.016 to 1.621) and 0.984 (0.876 to 1.106), respectively. The geometric mean ratios (90%CIs) of C and AUC for SHR4640 after coadministration compared with SHR4640 alone were 0.910 (0.839 to 0.988) and 0.929 (0.893 to 0.966), respectively. Febuxostat had no effect on SHR4640 pharmacokinetic parameters, as the 90%CIs of the geometric mean ratios were all within the range of 0.80 to 1.25. The coadministration of febuxostat and SHR4640 was well tolerated. The coadministration of SHR4640 with febuxostat was not associated with any clinically relevant pharmacokinetic drug interactions. SHR4640 combined with febuxostat had a synergistic effect on reducing uric acid in the pharmacodynamics, with the AUC decreasing from 7440 to 3170 h μmol\/L compared with febuxostat alone and from 5730 to 2960 h μmol\/L compared with SHR4640 alone.",

        "Abstract":"BACKGROUND: Lifestyle and diet play a significant role in hyperuricaemia. Accumulating evidence indicates that tea consumption is associated with hyperuricaemia and gout. However, diverse compounds in different types of tea make it quite difficult to determine the relevant molecular mechanism. Here, we compared the effects of six types of tea on hyperuricaemia induced by potassium oxonate (PO) and hypoxanthine in rats and investigated the possible underlying mechanisms.\nMETHODS: Rats were randomly assigned to ten groups: the control, hyperuricaemia model, benzbromarone positive control, traditional Chinese medicine Simiao San positive control, green tea, yellow tea, black tea, white tea, red tea, and cyan tea treatment groups. After 21 days, uric acid (UA), xanthine oxidase (XOD), alanine aminotransferase (ALT),blood urea nitrogen (BUN), and creatinine (CRE) were assessed. Serum levels of interleukin-1β (IL-1β) were measured with an enzyme-linked immunosorbent assay. Haematoxylin-eosin staining and immunohistochemistry were used to assess liver and kidney injury.\nRESULTS: The levels of UA, CRE, and BUN in the treatment group were decreased to varying degrees. There was a significant reduction in UA, CRE, and BUN levels for yellow tea compared to the positive control drugs. Yellow tea suppressed XOD activity and alleviated hepatic and kidney injury. Network pharmacology and untargeted metabolomics indicated that ten yellow tea bioactive ingredients and 35 targets were responsible for preventing hyperuricaemia, which was mediated by 94 signalling pathways, including IL-1β and TNF.\nCONCLUSION: These findings indicate that green tea cannot reduce the serum uric acid level of hyperuricaemic rats. Yellow tea can significantly improve hyperuricaemia by regulating the inflammatory response, autophagy, and apoptosis. This study provides a potential candidate for the treatment of hyperuricaemia and a basis for selecting therapeutic tea for patients with hyperuricaemia.",

        "Abstract":"OBJECTIVE: To assess efficacy, safety, pharmacokinetics, and immunogenicity of pegloticase plus methotrexate (MTX) versus pegloticase plus placebo cotreatment for uncontrolled gout in a randomized, placebo-controlled, double-blind trial.\nMETHODS: This study included adults with uncontrolled gout, defined as serum urate ≥7 mg\/dl, oral urate-lowering therapy failure or intolerance, and presence of ongoing gout symptoms including ≥1 tophus, ≥2 flares in the past 12 months, or gouty arthritis. Key exclusion criteria included MTX contraindication, current immunosuppressant use, G6PDH deficiency, and estimated glomerular filtration rate <40 ml\/minute\/1.73 m . Patients were randomized 2:1 to 52 weeks of pegloticase (8 mg biweekly) with either oral MTX (15 mg\/week) or placebo. The primary end point was the proportion of treatment responders during month 6 (defined as serum urate <6 mg\/dl for ≥80% of visits during weeks 20-24). Efficacy was evaluated in all randomized patients (intent-to-treat population), and safety was evaluated in all patients receiving ≥1 blinded MTX or placebo dose.\nRESULTS: A total of 152 patients were randomized, 100 to receive pegloticase plus MTX, 52 to receive pegloticase plus placebo. Significantly higher treatment response occurred during month 6 in the MTX group versus the placebo group (71.0% [71 of 100 patients] versus 38.5% [20 of 52 patients], respectively; between-group difference 32.3% [95% confidence interval 16.3%, 48.3%]) (P < 0.0001 for between-group difference). During the first 6 months of pegloticase plus MTX or pegloticase plus placebo treatment, 78 (81.3%) of 96 MTX patients versus 47 (95.9%) of 49 placebo patients experienced ≥1 adverse event (AE), most commonly gout flare (64 [66.7%] of 96 MTX patients and 34 [69.4%] of 49 placebo patients). Reports of AEs and serious AEs were comparable between groups, but the infusion reaction rate was considerably lower with MTX cotherapy (4.2% [4 of 96 MTX patients, including 1 patient who had anaphylaxis]) than with placebo cotherapy (30.6% [15 of 49 placebo patients, 0 who had anaphylaxis]) (P < 0.001). Antidrug antibody positivity was also lower in the MTX group.\nCONCLUSION: MTX cotherapy markedly increased pegloticase response rate over placebo (71.0% versus 38.5%) during month 6 with no new safety signals. These findings verify higher treatment response rate, lower infusion reaction incidence, and lower immunogenicity when pegloticase is coadministered with MTX.",

This article examined the association between long-term use of ULT and cognitive decline among community-dwelling older adults with spontaneous memory complaints.

We compared cognitive decline during the 5-year follow-up between three groups according to ULT (i.e. allopurinol and febuxostat) use: participants treated with ULT during at least 75% of the study period (PT ≥ 75; n = 51), less than 75% (PT &lt; 75; n = 31), and non-treated participants (PNT; n = 1591). Cognitive function (measured by a composite score) was assessed at baseline, 6 months and every year for 5 years. Linear mixed models were performed and results were adjusted for age, sex, body mass index (BMI), diagnosis of arterial hypertension or diabetes, baseline composite cognitive score, and MAPT intervention groups. After the 5-year follow-up, only non-treated participants presented a significant decline in the cognitive composite score (mean change - 0.173, 95%CI - 0.212 to - 0.135; p &lt; 0.0001).

        "Published":"2022-08-31",
        "Abstract":"Gout is a metabolic disorder, and one of the most common inflammatory arthritic conditions, caused by elevated serum urate (SU). Gout is globally rising, partly due to global dietary changes and the growing older adult population. Gout was known to affect people of high socioeconomic status. Currently, gout disproportionately affects specific population subgroups that share distinct racial and ethnic backgrounds. While genetics may predict SU levels, nongenetic factors, including diet, cultural traditions, and social determinants of health (SDOH), need to be evaluated to optimize patient treatment outcomes. This approach would allow clinicians to assess whether certain cultural norms, or some SDOH, could be contributing to their patient's risk of developing gout or recurrent gout flares. A cultural assessment may inform the development of culturally tailored dietary recommendations for patients with gout. Causal and association studies investigating the interaction between diet, genetics, and gout, should be cautiously interpreted due to the lack of reproducibility in different racial groups. Optimal gout management could benefit from a multidisciplinary approach, involving pharmacists and nurses. While data on the effect of specific dietary recommendations on managing hyperuricemia and gout may be limited, counseling patients with gout on the role of a healthy diet to optimally control their gout flares and other comorbidities should be part of patient education. Future research investigating the role of a gene-diet interaction in the context of hyperuricemia and gout is needed. Optimal care for patients with gout needs to include a holistic assessment for gout and gout-related comorbidities. Additionally, addressing health beliefs and culture-specific lifestyle factors among patients with gout may reduce their risk of gout flare, improve adherence to urate-lowering therapy (ULT), and achieve health equity in gout management.",

It is a complete, integrated, and complex knowledge system in epistemology. This study is aimed at exploring the clinical effectiveness of TCM called the Guizhi Shaoyao Zhimu Decoction in the treatment of hyperuricemia. A total of 100 patients with hyperuricemia at the Medical College of the Second Clinical College, Shandong, China, from January 2019 to January 2022 are selected as the research subjects and divided into group A and group B according to the random table method, with 50 cases in each group. Group A is treated with oral allopurinol tablets, 100 mg, 2 times a day, and group B is treated with the modified Guizhi Shaoyao Zhimu Decoction based on group A. For observation, serum uric acid (SUA) levels, urinary uric acid (UUA) levels, levels of serum inflammatory response factors (IL-6, CRP, and TNF-), vascular endothelial function indexes (serum malondialdehyde (MDA) content, nitric oxide (NO) content), an acute attack of gout, and the incidence of adverse reactions are measured. Results show that after 2 w and 4 w of treatment, the levels of blood uric acid in each group gradually decreased compared with those before treatment, and group B is lower than group A ( < 0.05). After treatment, the vascular endothelial function indexes and inflammatory factor levels in each group are significantly improved compared with those before treatment, and the indexes in group B are better than those in group A. There is no significant difference in the incidence of related adverse reactions and acute attack of gout ( > 0.05). This shows that the TCM Guizhi Shaoyao Zhimu Decoction has a significant curative effect in the treatment of patients with hyperuricemia, which is worthy of clinical reference application.",

        "Abstract":"BACKGROUND AND OBJECTIVE: Previously, we developed a pharmacokinetic-pharmacodynamic model of allopurinol, oxypurinol, and biomarkers, hypoxanthine, xanthine, and uric acid, in neonates with hypoxic-ischemic encephalopathy, in which high initial biomarker levels were observed suggesting an impact of hypoxia. However, the full pharmacodynamics could not be elucidated in our previous study. The current study included additional data from the ALBINO study (NCT03162653) placebo group, aiming to characterize the dynamics of hypoxanthine, xanthine, and uric acid in neonates with hypoxic-ischemic encephalopathy.\nMETHODS: Neonates from the ALBINO study who received allopurinol or placebo mannitol were included. An extended population pharmacokinetic-pharmacodynamic model was developed based on the mechanism of purine metabolism, where synthesis, salvage, and degradation via xanthine oxidoreductase pathways were described. The initial level of the biomarkers was a combination of endogenous turnover and high disease-related amounts. Model development was accomplished by nonlinear mixed-effects modeling (NONMEM, version 7.5).\nRESULTS: In total, 20 neonates treated with allopurinol and 17 neonates treated with mannitol were included in this analysis. Endogenous synthesis of the biomarkers reduced with 0.43% per hour because of precursor exhaustion. Hypoxanthine was readily salvaged or degraded to xanthine with rate constants of 0.5 1\/h (95% confidence interval 0.33-0.77) and 0.2 1\/h (95% confidence interval 0.09-0.31), respectively. A greater salvage was found in the allopurinol treatment group consistent with its mechanism of action. High hypoxia-induced initial levels of biomarkers were quantified, and were 1.2-fold to 2.9-fold higher in neonates with moderate-to-severe hypoxic-ischemic encephalopathy compared with those with mild hypoxic-ischemic encephalopathy. Half-maximal xanthine oxidoreductase inhibition was achieved with a combined allopurinol and oxypurinol concentration of 0.68 mg\/L (95% confidence interval 0.48-0.92), suggesting full xanthine oxidoreductase inhibition during the period studied.\nCONCLUSIONS: This extended pharmacokinetic-pharmacodynamic model provided an adequate description of the complex hypoxanthine, xanthine, and uric acid metabolism in neonates with hypoxic-ischemic encephalopathy, suggesting a positive allopurinol effect on these biomarkers. The impact of hypoxia on their dynamics was characterized, underlining higher hypoxia-related initial exposure with a more severe hypoxic-ischemic encephalopathy status.",

        "Abstract":"OBJECTIVE: Despite increasing overall health care spending over the past several decades, little is known about long-term patterns of spending among US patients with gout. Current approaches to assessing spending typically focus on composite measures or patients agnostic to disease state; in contrast, examining spending using longitudinal measures may better discriminate patients and target interventions to those in need. We used a data-driven approach to classify and predict spending patterns in patients with gout.\nMETHODS: Using insurance claims data from 2017-2019, we used group-based trajectory modeling to classify patients ages 40 years or older diagnosed with gout and treated with urate-lowering therapy (ULT) by their total health care spending over 2 years. We assessed the ability to predict membership in each spending group using logistic and generalized boosted regression with split-sample validation. Models were estimated using different sets of predictors and evaluated using C statistics.\nRESULTS: In 57,980 patients, the mean ± SD age was 71.0 ± 10.5 years, and 17,194 patients (29.7%) were female. The best-fitting model included the following groups: minimal spending (13.2%), moderate spending (37.4%), and high spending (49.4%). The ability to predict groups was high overall (e.g., boosted C statistics with all predictors: minimal spending [0.89], moderate spending [0.78], and high spending [0.90]). Although average adherence was relatively high in the population, for the high-spending group, the most influential predictors were greater gout medication adherence and diabetes melllitus diagnosis.\nCONCLUSION: We identified distinct long-term health care spending patterns in patients with gout using ULT with high accuracy. Several clinical predictors could be key areas for intervention, such as gout medication use or diabetes melllitus.",

        "Abstract":"OBJECTIVES: The current world witnesses a greatly increased prevalence and incidence of hyperuricemia and gout with unfortunately the comparative efficacy and safety of present available uricosuric agents remaining uncertain. We herein aimed to investigate the most appropriate uricosuric agent for gout or hyperuricemia patients.\nMETHOD: PubMed, Embase, Cochrane Library databases, and ClinicalTrials.gov from inception to 2 July 2022 were searched to retrieve eligible studies assessing efficacy and safety of uricosuric drugs in hyperuricemia or gout patients. Network meta-analysis was carried out using the Stata 16.0 software.\nRESULTS: Twelve randomized controlled trials comprising 1851 patients were eventually included. Network meta-analysis showed that dotinurad 4 mg once daily, verinurad, dotinurad 2 mg once daily, dotinurad 1 mg once daily, and benzbromarone were the top 5 effective treatments to achieve target serum uric acid. Furthermore, dotinurad 4 mg once daily was more effective at achieving urate-lowering targets (RR of dotinurad 4 mg once daily vs. probenecid: 1.68, 95% CI [1.13; 2.50]) and safer (RR of probenecid vs. dotinurad 4 mg once daily: 1.77, 95% CI [0.69; 4.56]) than probenecid.\nCONCLUSIONS: This network meta-analysis demonstrated an important absolute benefit of dotinurad 4 mg once daily to achieve target serum uric acid and low risk of adverse events for drug treatment of gout or hyperuricemia patients. Additionally, verinurad might be used as an alternative uricosuric therapeutic option to dotinurad. These findings provided further comprehensive insight into the treatment value of current uricosuric agents for gout or hyperuricemia. Key Points 1. This is the first systematic review and network meta-analysis examining the efficacy and safety of currently available uricosuric agents in gout or hyperuricemia patients. 2. Recommended doses of dotinurad 4mg once daily used for the treatment of gout or hyperuricemia patients can significantly decrease serum uric acid levels. 3. The present findings will provide further comprehensive insight into the treatment value of certain uricosuric agents for gout or hyperuricemia.",

Generally, a multi-component system may yield either a eutectic, salt, and\/or a cocrystal. This study adopted a methodical orthogonal framework to analyze the final solid form. A single crystal X-ray structural investigation revealed the formation of a heterosynthon with carboxylic and benzimidazole groups of FEB and TEL, respectively, in the triclinic P-1 space group. ΔpKa of the heterosynthon is ∼1.5, hence, based on the empirical rules, a salt-cocrystal continuum is hypothesized. Further, attenuated total reflectance Fourier transform infrared (ATR-FTIR), and Raman spectroscopy were employed to corroborate the hydrogen bond formation in the heterosynthon (-N---H-O-), which confirmed the propensity for cocrystal formation.

The MIRROR open-label trial showed a 6-month pegloticase + methotrexate co-therapy responder rate of 79%, compared to an established 42% pegloticase monotherapy responder rate. Longer-term efficacy\/safety data are presented here.\nMETHODS: Uncontrolled gout patients (serum urate [SU] ≥ 6 mg\/dL and SU ≥ 6 mg\/dL despite urate-lowering therapy [ULT], ULT intolerance, or functionally-limiting tophi) were included. Patients with immunocompromised status, G6PD deficiency, severe kidney disease, or methotrexate contraindication were excluded. Oral methotrexate (15 mg\/week) and folic acid (1 mg\/day) were administered 4 weeks before and during pegloticase therapy. Twelve-month responder rate (SU < 6 mg\/dL for ≥ 80% during month 12), 52-week change from baseline in SU, and extended safety were examined. Efficacy analyses were performed for patients receiving ≥ 1 pegloticase infusion. Pharmacokinetics (PK)\/anti-drug antibodies (ADAs) were examined and related to efficacy\/safety findings.\nRESULTS: Fourteen patients were included (all male, 49.3 ± 8.7 years, 13.8 ± 7.4-year gout history, pre-therapy SU 9.2 ± 2.5 mg\/dL). Three patients were non-responders and discontinued study treatment before 24 weeks, one patient exited the study per protocol at 24 weeks (enrolled prior to treatment extension amendment), and 10 remained in the study through week 52. Of the 10, 8 completed 52 weeks of pegloticase + methotrexate and were 12-month responders. The remaining two discontinued pegloticase + methotrexate at week 24 (met treatment goals) and stayed in the study under observation (allopurinol prescribed at physicians' discretion); one remained a responder at 12 months. At 52 weeks, change from baseline in SU was - 8.2 ± 4.1 mg\/dL (SU 1.1 ± 2.4 mg\/dL, n = 10). Gout flares were common early in treatment but progressively decreased while on therapy (weeks 1-12, 13\/14 [92.9%]; weeks 36-52, 2\/8 [25.0%]). One patient recovered from sepsis (serious AE). Two non-responders developed high ADA titers; fewer patients had trough concentrations (C) below the quantitation limit (BQL), and the median C was higher (1.03 µg\/mL vs. BQL) than pegloticase monotherapy trials.\nCONCLUSIONS: Pegloticase + methotrexate co-therapy was well-tolerated over 12 months, with sustained SU lowering, progressive gout flare reduction, and no new safety concerns. Antibody\/PK findings suggest methotrexate attenuates ADA formation, coincident with higher treatment response rates.\nTRIAL REGISTRATION: ClinicalTrials.gov, NCT03635957 .

        "Published":"2022-08-20",
        "Abstract":"The present review explores the role of xanthine oxidoreductase (XOR) in the development and progression of chronic kidney disease (CKD). Human XOR is a multi-level regulated enzyme, which has many physiological functions, but that is also implicated in several pathological processes. The main XOR activities are the purine catabolism, which generates uric acid, and the regulation of cell redox state and cell signaling, through the production of reactive oxygen species. XOR dysregulation may lead to hyperuricemia and oxidative stress, which could have a pathogenic role in the initial phases of CKD, by promoting cell injury, hypertension, chronic inflammation and metabolic derangements. Hypertension is common in CKD patients and many mechanisms inducing it (upregulation of renin-angiotensin-aldosterone system, endothelial dysfunction and atherosclerosis) may be influenced by XOR products. High XOR activity and hyperuricemia are also risk factors for obesity, insulin resistance, type 2 diabetes and metabolic syndrome that are frequent CKD causes. Moreover, CKD is common in patients with gout, which is characterized by hyperuricemia, and in patients with cardiovascular diseases, which are associated with hypertension, endothelial dysfunction and atherosclerosis. Although hyperuricemia is undoubtedly related to CKD, controversial findings have been hitherto reported in patients treated with urate-lowering therapies.",

The primary outcome was a composite endpoint of myocardial infarction, coronary revascularization, and stroke. Secondary outcomes were individual components of the primary outcome, hospitalized heart failure, and all-cause mortality. Subgroup analyses were done for those at high CV risk, long-term users (follow-up >3 years), and those without chronic kidney disease. We used Cox proportional hazard models to estimate hazard ratios (HRs) and 95% confidence intervals (CIs).\nRESULTS: We included 160,930 PS-matched pairs of febuxostat and allopurinol users (mean age 59.3 years, 79.6% male). Incidence rates of the primary outcome were 2.06 and 2.27 per 100 person-years for febuxostat and allopurinol users, respectively, with a HR [95% CI] of 1.03 [0.95-1.12] comparing febuxostat versus allopurinol initiators. We also observed similar risks for secondary outcomes, except for reduced all-cause mortality among febuxostat users (HR [95% CI] of 0.84 [0.78-0.91]). Subgroup analyses also showed non-inferior CV safety of febuxostat.\nCONCLUSION: In this population-based cohort study including the largest number of febuxostat users to date, we found non-inferior CV safety of febuxostat versus allopurinol. There was a 16% reduction in all-cause mortality among febuxostat users.",

We aimed to assess the predictors of disease-activity at 12 months in a real-life setting.\nMETHODS: Consecutive patients referred to Rheumatology Units for suspected acute crystal-induced arthritis were enrolled in a multicentre-cohort study. Only patients with clinical diagnosis of gout were eligible. Disease-activity was evaluated by the Patient Acceptable Symptom State (PASS) on a visual analogue scale (VAS, 0=unsatisfactory, 100=satisfactory) at 0 (T0) and 12 months (T12), and the composite score called Gout Activity Score (GAS) calculated on the number of arthritic attacks (flare count), serum uric acid (sUA), cumulative number of tophi, VAS (T12), PtGA (T12).

        "Abstract":"Abnormal uric acid level result in the development of hyperuricemia and hallmark of various diseases, including renal injury, gout, cardiovascular disorders, and non-alcoholic fatty liver. This study was designed to explore the anti-inflammatory potential of stevia residue extract (STR) against hyperuricemia-associated renal injury in mice. The results revealed that STR at dosages of 150 and 300 mg\/kg bw and allopurinol markedly modulated serum uric acid, blood urea nitrogen, and creatinine in hyperuricemic mice. Serum and renal cytokine levels (IL-18, IL-6, IL-1Β, and TNF-α) were also restored by STR treatments. Furthermore, mRNA and immunohistochemistry (IHC) analysis revealed that STR ameliorates UA (uric acid)-associated renal inflammation, fibrosis, and EMT (epithelial-mesenchymal transition) via MMPS (matrix metalloproteinases), inhibiting NF-κB\/NLRP3 activation by the AMPK\/SIRT1 pathway and modulating the JAK2-STAT3 and Nrf2 signaling pathways. In summary, the present study provided experimental evidence that STR is an ideal candidate for the treatment of hyperuricemia-mediated renal inflammation. PRACTICAL APPLICATIONS: The higher uric acid results in hyperuricemia and gout. The available options for the treatment of hyperuricemia and gout are the use of allopurinol, and colchicine drugs, etc. These drugs possess several undesirable side effect. The polyphenolic compounds are abundantly present in plants, for example, stevia residue extract (STR) exert a positive effect on human health. From this study results, we can recommend that polyphenolic compounds enrich STR could be applied to develop treatment options for the treatment of hyperuricemia and gout.",

        "Abstract":"BACKGROUND: Studies have shown that hyperuricemia (HUA) is an independent risk factor for all-cause death and residual kidney function loss in peritoneal dialysis (PD) patients. The control of blood uric acid (UA) is an important link to improve the prognosis of end-stage renal disease (ESRD). As a therapeutic drug for HUA, febuxostat is rarely studied in PD patients. The purpose of our study is to investigate the safety, efficacy, and effect on residual renal function (RRF) of febuxostat in patients undergoing PD.\nMETHODS: This is a retrospective single-arm cohort study. During the study period which from September 2016 to November 2020, 191 patients underwent PD at this hospital. Among these patients, 84 were administrated for over a period of 3 months and were eventually included. These 84 patients (51 males and 33 females; average age: 55.18 years) were undergoing PD complicated with HUA or gout who received febuxostat during a regular follow-up from January 2018 to November 2020. Serum UA (sUA) levels, blood routine, liver function, and RRF were compared before and after febuxostat administration. Adverse events (AEs) resulting from febuxostat treatment were collected from medical records.\nRESULTS: All 84 patients were administered febuxostat for over 3 months, including 39 for over 6 months and 26 for over 12 months. Some 60 patients were treated with febuxostat dose of 20 mg\/day and the remaining 24 patients received 40 mg\/day. Compared with pretreatment level, the mean sUA level was observed to be markedly reduced at 1 month after febuxostat administration (320.2±87.27 vs. 498.8±81.47 µmol\/L, P<0.0001) and at 3 months (291.6±82.66 vs. 498.8±81.47 µmol\/L, P<0.0001) and subsequently remained at a significantly low level for 12 months. Only 5 patients stopped febuxostat because of its associated AEs. An initial dose of 40 mg\/day was associated with a higher rate of AEs compared with dose of 20 mg\/day (25% vs. 18.33%, respectively). After febuxostat treatment, no significant differences were observed between RRF in the two groups.\nCONCLUSIONS: Febuxostat may be safe and efficient in patients undergoing PD and may not impair RRF. Febuxostat administration at dose of 20 mg\/day may be an appropriate dose for patients undergoing PD.",

Gas chromatography mass spectrometry (GC\/MS) was utilized for metabolomics analysis. We found that in patients with stage 3 CKD and hyperuricemia, allopurinol lowered serum urate while increasing serum xanthine levels. Allopurinol, however, did not significantly suppress measured serum XO activity. Of note, baseline serum XO activity was low. Additionally, neither baseline serum XO activity nor XO protein expression were associated with measures of vascular dysfunction or with systemic or endothelial biomarkers of oxidative stress. Allopurinol affected several pathways, including pentose phosphate, pyrimidine, and tyrosine metabolism.

For mechanistic insight into impact on inflammatory processes and cardiometabolic risk factors of xanthine oxidase inhibitor urate-lowering therapy (ULT) titration to target, we performed a prospective study of gout serum metabolomes from a ULT trial.\nMETHODS: Sera of gout patients meeting the 2015 ACR\/EULAR gout classification criteria (n = 20) and with hyperuricemia were studied at time zero and weeks 12 and 24 of febuxostat or allopurinol dose titration ULT. Ultrahigh performance liquid chromatography-tandem mass spectroscopy acquired the serum spectra. Data were assessed using the Metabolon and Metaboloanalyst software. Lipolysis validation assays were done in febuxostat and\/or colchicine-treated 3T3-L1 differentiated adipocytes.\nRESULTS: Serum urate decreased from time zero (8.21 ±1.139 SD) at weeks 12 (5.965 ± 1.734 SD) and 24 (5.655 ±1.763 SD). Top metabolites generated by changes in nucleotide and certain amino acid metabolism and polyamine pathways were enriched at 12 and 24 weeks ULT, respectively. Decreases in multiple fatty acid metabolites were observed at 24 weeks, linked with obesity. In cultured adipocytes, febuxostat significantly decreased while colchicine increased the lipolytic response to β-adrenergic-agonism or TNF.\nCONCLUSION: Metabolomic profiles linked xanthine oxidase inhibitor-based ULT titration to target with reduced serum free fatty acids. In vitro validation studies revealed that febuxostat, but not colchicine, reduced lipolysis in cultured adipocytes. Since soluble urate, xanthine oxidase inhibitor treatment, and free fatty acids modulate inflammation, our findings suggest that by suppressing lipolysis, ULT could regulate inflammation in gout and comorbid metabolic and cardiovascular disease.",

        "Abstract":"Flare is the dominant feature of gout and occurs because of inflammatory response to monosodium urate crystals; prevention of gout flares should be the major goal of gout care. However, a paradoxical increase in the risk of flare following initiation of urate-lowering therapy presents considerable challenges for proving the expected long-term benefits of flare prevention in clinical trials. Nevertheless, excluding from enumeration flares that occur in the initial post-randomization period (which can last several months to 1 year) can threaten the core benefits of randomization: the characteristics of the remaining participants can differ from those who were randomized, introducing potential bias from confounding (both measured and unmeasured); participants who drop out or die are excluded from the analysis, introducing potential selection bias; and, finally, ignoring initial flares underestimates participants' experience during the trial. This Perspective discusses these issues and recommends measures that will allow for high-level evidence that preserves the randomization principle, to satisfy methodological scrutiny and generate robust evidence-based guidelines for gout care.",

        "Abstract":"BACKGROUND\/OBJECTIVE: Diabetes mellitus is a common \"non-gout\" disease with high incidence. Several studies have shown that serum uric acid level in patients with diabetes is higher than that in healthy individuals, and is accompanied by severe albuminuria and high serum creatinine (Scr). Recent clinical studies have found that uric acid-lowering therapy (such as allopurinol) could reduce urinary albumin excretion rates (UAER) and Scr, increase eGFR, and thus reduce kidney damage in patients with diabetes. Therefore, this meta-analysis [PROSPERO CRD42021274465] intended to evaluate the efficacy and safety of allopurinol in patients with diabetes mellitus.\nMETHODS: We thoroughly searched five electronic resource databases for randomized controlled trials (RCTs) that compared the efficacy and safety of allopurinol versus conventional treatment or placebo for the treatment of patients with diabetes mellitus. Predetermined outcomes were considered continuous variables, mean difference (MD) was used for the determination of effect size (standardized mean difference [SMD] was used to determine the effect size when there were different evaluation criteria in different articles), and the corresponding 95% confidence interval (CI) was calculated. All outcome measures were analyzed using a random-effects model for data analysis.\nRESULTS: Ten eligible trials with a total of 866 participants were included in the meta-analysis. Allopurinol was more effective in decreasing serum uric acid (SUA) levels compared with conventional treatment ( = 0.0001) or placebo ( < 0.00001). Moreover, the levels of 24-hour urine protein were significantly lower in the allopurinol group ( < 0.00001). The subgroup analysis of Scr showed that the Scr of patients with an allopurinol treatment duration of fewer than six months was significantly lower than that of the control group ( = 0.03). No significant difference in adverse events (AEs) was identified between the treatment and control groups.\nCONCLUSIONS: Our meta-analysis of RCTs showed that oral administration of allopurinol effectively reduced SUA levels in patients with diabetes, and patients' renal function was protected. More RCTs with larger sample sizes and higher quality are needed to clarify the role of allopurinol use in decreasing blood pressure, maintaining blood glucose levels, and improving renal function in patients with diabetes.",

Febuxostat plasma concentrations were measured by a validated high-performance liquid chromatography method. Population pharmacokinetic analysis was performed using NONMEM. A common variability on bioavailability (FVAR) approach was used to test the effect of fed status on absorption parameters. Covariates were modelled using a power model.\nRESULTS: The time course of the plasma concentrations of febuxostat is best described by a two-compartment model. In the final model, the population mean for apparent clearance (CL\/F), apparent central volume of distribution (Vc\/F), apparent peripheral volume of distribution (Vp\/F), absorption rate constant (ka) and apparent intercompartmental clearance (Q\/F) were 6.91 l h , 32.8 l, 19.4 l, 3.6 h and 1.25 l h , respectively.

Renal function, as assessed by creatinine clearance, was a significant covariate for CL\/F while body mass index was a significant covariate for Vc\/F.\nCONCLUSIONS: Renal function and body mass index were significant covariates.

Reporting odds ratios (RORs) and 95% confidence intervals (95% CI) were calculated.\nRESULTS: Among 72,822 spontaneous ADR reports submitted to the Vietnam National Drug Information and Adverse Drug Reaction Monitoring Centre, 392 reports were on SJS\/TEN, of which, 65 cases (16.6%) were related to allopurinol. The signals of allopurinol-induced SJS\/TEN in Vietnam started in 2014 (ROR of 3.531, 95% CI: 1.830-6.810) and annually increased until 2019 (ROR of 11.923, 95% CI: 8.508-16.710). The preventability assessment showed that no allopurinol-induced SJS\/TEN case was definitely unpreventable. 61.6% of the SJS\/TEN cases were avoidable because they were associated with inappropriate prescribing such as unapproved indications, too high initial dose and even rechallenging in patients with a history of allopurinol allergy.\nWHAT IS NEW AND CONCLUSION: The signals of allopurinol-induced SJS\/TEN in Vietnam started in 2014 and annually increased until 2019. Our first report specifically focusing on the ADR preventability of allopurinol showed that correction of medical errors relating to prescription could prevent more than 60% of SJS\/TEN cases in Vietnamese allopurinol users. This is a feasible and practical solution, provided that there would be a systematic change in both healthcare systems and public awareness.",

Meanwhile, the confidence interval (CI) of either relative risk or mean difference was set to 95%. Besides, the heterogeneity of the research results is tested by  .\nRESULTS: Ten studies were ultimately included in this meta-analysis. All of them were considered to be random controlled trials. 10 studies reported the serum uric acid of the test group and the control group, which was significantly lower (SMD: -146.44, 95% Cl: -195.96, -86.93, and  < 0.01) than the control group, EGFR (SMD: 3.21, 95% Cl: 1.17, 5.25, and  < 0.01), serum creatinine (SMD: -15.27, 95% Cl: -20.75, -9.79, and  < 0.01), serum urea nitrogen (SMD: -2.37, 95% Cl: -3.31, -1.61, and  < 0.01), and adverse reactions (OR: 0.74, 95% Cl: 0.32, 1.68, and  = 0.47).\nCONCLUSION: The results of this study suggest that febuxostat may be effective in patients with CKD with HUA, as evidenced by serum uric acid, creatinine, urea nitrogen, and EGFR.

        "Abstract":"OBJECTIVE: To examine the associations of changes in serum urate (SU) with health-related quality of life (HRQOL) in gout.\nMETHODS: We used the first 6-months of data from four interventional trials and one observational, open-label study of urate-lowering therapy (ULT) use. HRQOL were assessed at baseline and every 3-months, and SU was measured monthly. Primary outcome measures were Short-form 36 physical and mental component summary scores, Health Assessment Questionnaire Disability Index (HAQ-DI), Sheehan Disability Scale (SDS), Patient Global Assessment, and pain scores in the last week. Linear mixed models for each outcome were adjusted as appropriate for current SU, change in urate in the last month, number of flare-affected days in the last month, baseline BMI, age, comorbidities, sex, ethnicity, trial\/study and treatment combination, and tophi status (fixed effects); subject, and the trial\/study month were random effects.\nRESULTS: Higher current SU correlated with reduced physical and mental HRQOL, and increased SDS and pain but not with HAQ-DI score. In the first 6-months of new\/escalating ULT use, absolute change in SU levels associated with poorer outcomes on the HAQ-DI scale (β (95% CI) = 0.013 (0.007-0.019)) and poorer outcomes on SDS, SF-36 MCS, patient global and pain scales. Reduction of SU associated with poorer outcomes in all six measures.\nCONCLUSION: High SU levels were associated with poorer HRQOL, pain and Sheehan disability score. Recent SU level fluctuations are associated with poorer outcomes, primarily driven by a reduction in SU. Clinical emphasis on slow rather than fast SU reduction and the routine use of effective, anti-inflammatory medications at ULT initiation\/escalation may avoid short-term poor outcomes.",

Uric acid-lowering drugs (ULDs) are used to reduce uric acid levels for the treatment of hyperuricemia and gout. However, there is a lack of robust and real-world data on the history and treatment of patients with newly diagnosed hyperuricemia or gout in Japan. This retrospective, longitudinal, historical cohort study determined the characteristics of patients with hyperuricemia and\/or gout, and prescription of, and adherence to, ULDs using data from the JMDC Claims Database. The primary evaluation population included 64 677 patients with newly diagnosed hyperuricemia and\/or gout. Of these, only 26 501 (41.0%) had a prescription for ULDs at diagnosis. Even when ULDs were prescribed, the persistence rate of prescriptions declined over time, with a 54.4% persistence rate for ULDs at 12 months after the index diagnosis. In subgroups of patients with or without hypertension and diabetes, the rate of ULD prescription continuation was significantly higher in those with comorbidities than in those without (76.8% vs. 42.6% in those with vs. without hypertension, and 78.7% vs. 52.2% in those with vs. without diabetes).

        "Abstract":"['2', '2', '2', '2', '2']\nIn this work, a highly efficient electrochemiluminescence (ECL) biosensor was developed based on the nanosponge-hydrogel system for uric acid (UA) detection. First, the nanosponge consisted of polylactic acid glycolic acid (PLGA) nanoparticles immobilized with MoS quantum dots (QDs) and urate oxidase (UAO). The marked loading capability of PLGA nanoparticles enables loading many biomolecules and QDs for the specific recognition of UA. Urate oxidase on the nanosponge can catalyze UA to generate H O in situ, which further triggers the ECL signal for the MoS QDs. Furthermore, the biocompatible acrylamide-based hydrogel not only effectively retained the functionalities of the chimeric nanosponge-hydrogel, but also provided structural integrity and engineering flexibility on the electrode for ECL sensing applications. In addition, there were many ester groups and amide bonds in the nanosponge-hydrogel structure. Therefore, many electron can be excited in the ECL process due to the large number of lone electron pairs on oxygen and nitrogen atoms. This resulted in a seven-fold ECL enhancement of the MoS QDs. Finally, the nanosponge-hydrogel structure-based ECL biosensor was successfully used in real clinical serum assays. This showed a good analytical performance for UA detection (100-500 μmol\/L) with a limit of detection of 20 μmol\/L.",

This comparative effectiveness clinical trial was undertaken to compare first-line nontitrated low-dose benzbromarone (LDBen) uricosuric therapy to XOI ULT with low-dose febuxostat (LDFeb) in gout patients with renal uric acid underexcretion.\nMETHODS: We conducted a prospective, randomized, single-center, open-label trial in men with gout and renal uric acid underexcretion (defined as fractional excretion of urate <5.5% and uric acid excretion ≤600 mg\/day\/1.73 m ). A total of 196 participants were randomly assigned to receive LDBen 25 mg daily or LDFeb 20 mg daily for 12 weeks. All participants received daily urine alkalization with oral sodium bicarbonate. The primary end point was the rate of achieving the serum urate target of <6 mg\/dl.\nRESULTS: More participants in the LDBen group achieved the serum urate target than those in the LDFeb group (61% compared to 32%, P < 0.001). Rates of adverse events, including gout flares and urolithiasis, did not differ between groups, with the exception of greater transaminase elevation in the LDFeb group (4% for LDBen compared to 15% for LDFeb, P = 0.008).\nCONCLUSION: Compared to LDFeb, LDBen has superior urate-lowering efficacy and similar safety in treating relatively young and healthy patients with renal uric acid underexcretion-type gout.",

Multivariable logistic regression analyses evaluated factors linked with adherence and ULT target attainment.\nRESULTS: Characterization of ULT outcomes in this cohort revealed that after 2 years ULT, MPR ≥80% patients had better target serum urate (SU) achievement (from 23.3% to 71.0%, P <0.001), lower flare frequency and palpable tophi compared to MPR <80%. However, only 44.7% of cohort subjects had MPR ≥80%. Male sex (OR 3.68), gout onset age >60 years (OR 3.51), disease duration >5 years (OR 1.70), more comorbidities (OR 1.74), baseline palpable tophi (OR 1.53), SU <6mg\/dL (360μmol\/L) (OR 1.92) and more frequent follow-up visits (OR 1.98) were significantly associated with high adherence. Nevertheless, significant independent risk factors for failed SU target achievement included male sex (OR 0.36) and more comorbidities (OR 0.85).\nCONCLUSION: Despite adherence to ULT linked to better outcomes for flares and tophi, the more adherent Chinese male patients and those with more comorbidities had decreased target SU attainment. Differences in adherence of Chinese gout patients compared to several primarily Western studies emphasize the importance of not stereotyping gout patients for projected nonadherence. Results underline the dual importance of identifying gout patients more likely to be ULT-adherent and leveraging adherence to drive treatment to SU target.",

The pooled odds ratio (OR) with 95% confidence interval based on the fixed-effect model was applied to compare the allopurinol exposure among cases (subjects with dementia) and controls (subjects without dementia).\nRESULTS: A total of 4 case-control studies relating the allopurinol exposure to the risk of dementia were identified. The study duration was from 9 to 14 years. The number of study persons was from 3148 to 137,640. The male percentage of study subjects was from 36.9 to 62.5. The mean age of study persons was from 72.3 to 78.7 years.

The sensitivity analysis revealed that after excluding the studies with concern, the pooled OR did not achieve statistical significance.\nCONCLUSIONS: This is the first meta-analysis to report that there is a negative relationship between the allopurinol exposure and the risk of dementia. Although the results favor the hypothesis, currently it is unable to draw strong conclusions about the protective effect of allopurinol against dementia due to inclusion of only a few eligible studies.

The prevalence of patients receiving ULT was significantly lower in Greenland (0.55%) compared to Denmark (1.40%) (p < 0.001). In both countries, the prevalence increased with age and was higher among men compared to women. In Greenland, patients receiving ULT were more often overweight, and more frequently received blood glucose-, lipid-, and blood pressure-lowering medicine including diuretics compared to age- and sex-matched controls. The prevalence of patients receiving ULT was significantly lower in Greenland compared to Denmark. Common life-style related risk factors for hyperuricemia and gout were observed frequently among ULT-treated patients compared to controls. Along with an increasing prevalence of lifestyle-related diseases in Greenland, the prevalence of patients receiving ULT may increase in the years to come.

A total of 23 RCTs were eligible. NMA identified beneficial effects of ULT on composite renal events and eGFR but not for other outcomes. Allopurinol and febuxostat had significantly lower composite renal events than placebo (RR 0.39, 95% confidence interval [CI] 0.23 to 0.66, and RR 0.68, 95% CI 0.46 to 0.99, respectively). Both treatments also resulted in significantly higher eGFR than placebo (MD 3.69 ml\/min\/1.73 m, 95% CI 1.31 to 6.08, and MD 2.89 ml\/min\/1.73 m, 95% CI 0.69 to 5.09, respectively). No evidence of inconsistency was identified.\nCONCLUSIONS: Evidence suggests that allopurinol and febuxostat are the ULTs of choice in reducing composite renal events and improving renal function.\nTRIAL REGISTRATION: This study was registered with PROSPERO: CRD42019145908.

        "Abstract":"OBJECTIVE: To synthesize evidence of the effect of contextual factors (CFs) on efficacy of urate-lowering therapy (ULT) on serum urate (SU) as outcome in gout patients.\nMETHODS: Randomised controlled trials (RCTs) from (updated) Cochrane reviews were the starting point. RCTs were included if they explored the role of any CF on efficacy of ULT on SU in gout patients. For CFs with sufficient data (i.e. ≥3 trials), a mixed-effects meta-regression analysis was performed with trial and comparison as random effects, whereas specific CFs were modelled as fixed factors.\nRESULTS: Eight RCTs were included. Effect modification by CFs was explored for age, sex, race, renal function, cardiovascular comorbidity, tophi, thiazide-diuretic use, and previous ULT use. Crude data stratified by renal function were available for four trials (36 randomised comparisons), and suitable for meta-analysis. Pooled estimates revealed that gout patients with a normal, mildly-, or moderately impaired renal function were consistently more likely to achieve SU target with ULT compared to control. Among RCTs comparing ULT to placebo (30 comparisons), effects of ULT on achieving SU target were not statistically different for those with normal (OR:66.87;[11.39-392.75]) compared to mildly (OR:28.54;[5.11-159.46]) and moderately (OR:21.45;[3.20-143.64]) impaired renal function, but seemed lower in those with severely impaired (OR:9.13;[0.96-86.97]) renal function. Data were insufficient to draw conclusions on effect modification by other CFs.\nCONCLUSION: Few RCTs report stratified analyses exploring the role of CFs. ULT seemed effective in reaching the SU target in all levels of renal function, though severely impaired renal function appeared to render a slight disadvantage.",

        "Abstract":"AIM: Gout is the most common form of inflammatory arthritis in men. Despite the availability of effective urate-lowering therapies (ULT), the management of gout is suboptimal due to poor persistence with ULT. This study examined national prescribing patterns of ULT to determine persistence with allopurinol in Australia.\nMETHODS: A 10% sample of the Australian Pharmaceutical Benefits Scheme dispensing claims database was used to identify individuals initiated on allopurinol between April 2014 and December 2019. The number of allopurinol scripts dispensed was used to estimate persistence with allopurinol. Persistence was defined as the number of months from initiation until discontinuation (last prescription with no further scripts acquired for a period thereafter). Kaplan-Meier curves were used to examine persistence, while Cox regression analysis was used to examine the influence of gender, concomitant colchicine and age.\nRESULTS: The largest drop in persistence occurred immediately after initiation, with 34% of patients discontinuing allopurinol 300-mg therapy in the first month. Median persistence with allopurinol 300 mg was 5 months (95% confidence interval 4.76-5.24), with around 63% of individuals not persisting with this therapy for more than 12 months. Concomitant prescription of colchicine on the day of allopurinol initiation only occurred in 7% of allopurinol initiations. No increase in persistence was observed for those co-prescribed colchicine.\nCONCLUSION: Persistence with allopurinol was poor. More effective methods targeting prescribers, patients and systems are required to promote persistence with allopurinol. Improving persistence to allopurinol is an important public health goal given the proven potential of this medication to eliminate gout.",

        "Abstract":"Uric acid is the final product of purine metabolism, and its increased serum levels have been directly involved in the pathogenesis and natural history of hypertension. The relationship between elevated uric acid and hypertension has been proven in both animals and humans, and its relevance is already evident in childhood and adolescent population. The mechanism responsible for blood pressure increase in hyperuricemic subjects is implicating both oxidative stress and intracellular urate activity with a primary involvement of XOR (xanthine-oxidoreductase activity). An increase in the relative risk of hypertension has been confirmed by genetic data and by large meta-analyses of epidemiological data. The effects of urate-lowering treatment on blood pressure control in patients with elevated serum uric acid has been investigated in a small number of reliable studies with a large heterogeneity of patient populations and study designs. However, 2 large meta-analyses suggest a significant effect of urate-lowering treatment on blood pressure, thus confirming the significant relationship between high serum urate and blood pressure. The future research should be focused on a more appropriate identification of patients with cardiovascular hyperuricemia by considering the correct cardiovascular threshold of serum urate, the time-course of uricemia fluctuations, and the identification of reliable markers of urate overproduction that could significantly clarify the clinical and therapeutic implications of the interaction between serum uric acid and hypertension.",

        "Abstract":"PURPOSE: Inflammation plays an important role in the initiation and progression of atherosclerosis, leading to poor clinical outcomes. Hyperuricemia is associated with the activation of the Nod-like receptor protein 3 inflammasome. Here, we investigated whether inhibition of inflammation using febuxostat lowered the risk of cardiovascular events.\nMETHODS: This is a post-hoc analysis of the randomized trial, Febuxostat for Cerebral and CaRdiorenovascular Events PrEvEntion StuDy (FREED). In total, 1067 patients (736 men and 331 women) were included in the analysis. We compared the serial changes in high-sensitivity C-reactive protein (hs-CRP) levels between febuxostat and non-febuxostat groups and assessed the correlation between the changes in uric acid (UA) and hs-CRP levels after febuxostat treatment. We also determined whether febuxostat could reduce a hard endpoint, defined as a composite of cardiovascular events and all-cause mortality.\nRESULTS: Serum UA levels in the febuxostat group were significantly lower than those in the non-febuxostat group after randomization (p < 0.05). However, hs-CRP levels were comparable between the two groups during the study. No significant correlation was observed between the changes in UA and hs-CRP levels after febuxostat treatment. The hard endpoints did not differ significantly between the two groups. In patients with baseline hs-CRP levels > 0.2 mg\/dL or those administered 40 mg of febuxostat, the drug did not reduce hs-CRP levels or decrease the hard endpoint.\nCONCLUSION: Febuxostat reduced the UA levels but did not affect the CRP levels, and therefore may fail to improve cardiovascular outcomes after treatment.\nTRIAL REGISTRATION: ClinicalTrial.gov (NCT01984749). https:\/\/clinicaltrials.gov\/ct2\/show\/NCT01984749.",

        "Published":null,
        "Abstract":"OBJECTIVES: Gout is a common disease caused by hyperglycemia. Traditional drugs for gout have both good therapeutic effects and serious side effects. Traditional Chinese medicine (TCM) is one of the potential sources of modern medicine, and is the development of new drugs for many diseases, including gout. TCM is an indispensable part of gout treatment. Compared with anti-gout medication commonly used in clinic (e.g. the xanthine oxidase inhibitors allopurinol and febuxostat), traditional Chinese medicine has fewer side effects in the treatment of gout and can safely control serum uric acid and the level of inflammation. However, there have been few studies on how traditional Chinese medicine controls uric acid and inflammation levels in patients with gout.\nKEY FINDINGS: Herbs are a valuable resource in the search for new drugs to treat many diseases, including gout. Phytochemicals in TCM treatment of gout mainly includes two aspects, anti-inflammatory and reducing uric acid content. The anti-inflammatory mechanism is mainly through the inactivation of NF-κB and NLRP3 inflammasome to reduce the inflammatory response induced by uric acid crystals. The mechanism of lowering uric acid is mainly through inhibiting the activity of xanthine oxidase and up-regulating the expression of URAT1 and GLUT9.In recent years, the intestinal flora has become a new field of understanding diseases. It has been observed that the occurrence of gout is closely related to changes in the intestinal flora. Herbaceous plants contain fiber, polyphenols, polysaccharides and other active components. When taken orally, Chinese herbs act like prebiotics. After traditional Chinese medicine treatment, the abundance levels of Bifidobacterium, Lactobacillus, Bacteroidetes and Prevotella were increased, while the abundance of Proteus and the Firmicutes\/Bacteroidetes ratio were decreased. Changes in the intestinal flora led to further changes in its metabolites, including short-chain fatty acids (SCFAs) and lipopolysaccharide (LPS), which ultimately down-regulate the TLR4\/NF-κB inflammatory signaling pathway, up-regulate GLUT9 and URAT1 gene expression and inhibition of xanthine oxidase activity. Destruction of the intestinal barrier is also an important factor in the occurrence of gout. Disruption of the intestinal barrier allows LPS to enter the bloodstream and activates the expression of various inflammatory factors, which causes gout.",

        "Abstract":"Objectives. Whether uric acid-lowering agent use in asymptomatic hyperuricemia can reduce the development of the first gout flare remains unsettled. The goal of the present research was to test the efficacy of benzbromarone and allopurinol on primary prevention of the first gout flare in persons with asymptomatic hyperuricemia in Taiwan. Methods. One observational cohort study was constructed to examine the 2001−2015 dataset adapted from the National Health Insurance Program of Taiwan containing the claims data of 2 million beneficiaries. Asymptomatic hyperuricemia was considered as individuals on uric acid-lowering therapy who did not have gout flares. Individuals aged 20−84 without gout flares who had the use of benzbromarone alone were assigned into a benzbromarone group. Individuals ages 20−84 without gout flares who had the use of allopurinol alone were assigned into an allopurinol group. The final study included 6111 pairs of 1:1 propensity score-matched individuals from both benzbromarone and allopurinol groups. The end point was assigned as individuals who were newly diagnosed with their first gout flare. The incidence rate of the first gout flare was estimated between the benzbromarone and allopurinol groups. A Cox proportional hazards regression model was applied to explore the hazard ratio and 95% confidence interval of the first gout flare related to benzbromarone use and allopurinol use. Results. The incidence rate of the first gout flare was lower in the benzbromarone group compared with an allopurinol group (3.29 versus 5.46 per 1000 person-months, incidence rate ratio = 0.60 and 95% confidence interval = 0.56−0.64). After adjustment for co-variables, the adjusted hazard ratio of the first gout flare was 0.63 (95% confidence interval = 0.59−0.68, p < 0.001) for the benzbromarone group when compared with the allopurinol group. Conclusion. People with asymptomatic hyperuricemia taking benzbromarone have a lower hazard of developing their first gout flare when compared with those taking allopurinol. Based on the medication safety, the therapeutic effects and the low price, with oral administration once daily, we suggest that benzbromarone should be the first drug of choice if clinicians are treating asymptomatic hyperuricemia.",

The key primary end points were uric acid or estimated glomerular filtration rate (eGFR) levels; the safety end points were death, renal event, cardiovascular event, and gastrointestinal event. A Bayesian network meta-analysis was conducted with the use of ADDIS and R software.\nFINDINGS: A total of 17 randomized clinical trials involving 2059 patients were included. The results of network meta-analysis showed that urate-lowering therapy could reduce urate levels in patients with CKD. Febuxostat was the most effective treatment in lowering urate levels according to the rank probability. Urate-lowering therapy has the tendency to delay the decline of eGFR, but the difference was not statistically significant. Ranking probability showed that benzbromarone, febuxostat, and allopurinol ranked higher than placebo in reducing the decline of eGFR. There were no statistically significant differences between groups in the incidence of all adverse effects.\nIMPLICATIONS: All urate-lowering therapies could reduce the urate level in patients with CKD, but the benefit of such therapy in renal disease is still unclear.

        "Abstract":"Patients with hyperuricemia and gout are at an increased risk for cardiovascular (CV) disease. Inhibition of the xanthine oxidase with allopurinol or febuxostat have become the mainstay for urate lowering therapy. However, it has been suggested that febuxostat increases the risk for CV mortality as compared to allopurinol. The aim of this retrospective cohort study was to assess the CV risk among patients with febuxostat or allopurinol therapy. Patients who initiated urate lowering therapy with febuxostat or allopurinol between 2014 and 2017 were selected from the drug reimbursement database of the Austrian health insurances funds. The primary CV endpoint was a composite of angina pectoris, nonfatal myocardial infarction, nonfatal subarachnoid or cerebral hemorrhage, nonfatal ischemic stroke, or death from any cause. In total, 28.068 patients (62.1% male) with a mean age of 71 years were included. 7.767 initiated febuxostat treatment and 20.301 received allopurinol. The incidence rate per 100 patient-years of the composite primary endpoint was 448 (febuxostat) and 356 (allopurinol) with a corresponding adjusted hazard ratio (HR) of 0.58 (95% CI 0.53-0.63) for allopurinol vs. febuxostat initiators. Similar HR were found for secondary endpoints including all-cause mortality [0.61 (95% CI 0.55-0.68)] and separate analyses of cardiac events [0.48 (95% CI 0.38-0.61)] and ischemic stroke [0.47 (95% CI 0.36-0.61)]. Data from this Austrian population-based study suggests that febuxostat initiators are at an increased risk for nonfatal CV events or death from any cause as compared to those with allopurinol. This is consistent with CV concerns of other trials, which limited the broad therapeutic use of febuxostat.",

        "Abstract":"Xanthine oxidase (XO) is a key enzyme in the generation and development of hyperuricemia. Thiazolidine-2-thione, a typical heterocyclic compound, have been widely used in the field of drug synthesis. In this study, a series of novel thiazolidine-2-thione derivatives were synthesized as XO inhibitors, and the XO inhibitory potencies of obtained compounds were evaluated by in vitro enzyme catalysis. The result shown that compound 6k behaved the strongest XO inhibitory activity with an IC50 value of 3.56 μmol\/L, which was approximately 2.5-fold more potent than allopurinol. The structure-activity relationship revealed that the phenyl-sulfonamide group was indispensable for thiazolidine-2-thione derivatives to produce XO inhibitory activity. The enzyme inhibition kinetics analyses confirmed that compound 6k exerted a mixed-type XO inhibition. Additionally, the molecular docking results suggested that the 4-fluorophenyl-sulfonyl moiety could interact with Gly260 and Ile264 in the innermost part of the active pocket through 2 hydrogen bonds, while the thiazolidinethione moiety could form two hydrogen bonds with Glu263 and Ser347 in hydrophobic pockets.

        "Abstract":"Present research study was conducted to formulate kidney-targeted allopurinol (AO)-loaded chitosan nanoparticles (ANPs) for management of hyperuricemic related nephrolithiasis. Different molecular weights of chitosan were used for fabricating ANP formulation by adopting modified ionotropic gelation method. The prepared batches were than evaluated for particle size analysis, entrapment efficiency, transmission electron microscopy, X-ray diffraction, Differential Scanning Calorimetry, in vitro release and in vivo animal study. The in vivo study depicted that post 2 h of administration of different formulations and pure drug; ANPs prepared from low molecular weight chitosan showed maximum concentration of AO in kidney signifying successful kidney targeting of drug (25.92 fold) whereas no or very less amount of AO was seen in other animal groups. Effectiveness (p < 0.01) of formulation in management of hyperuricemia-associated nephrolithiasis was also evaluated via estimation of urine pH and serum and urine uric acid levels of mice. Further histological study was also performed on kidney samples which again affirmed these results. Present investigation demonstrated that ANPs prepared from low MW chitosan depicted maximum kidney-targeting ability that might be due to its specific uptake by the kidneys as well as its higher solubility than other two polymers, which results in enhanced release rate from the formulation and also offers an efficient strategy for the management of hyperuricemic nephrolithiasis.",

        "Abstract":"OBJECTIVE: Gout is the most common form of inflammatory arthritis and is caused by deposition of monosodium urate crystals resulting from a high burden of uric acid (UA). High UA burden also has been associated with increased morbidity and mortality in the general population and progression to chronic kidney disease. In persons with gout and end-stage renal disease (ESRD), prior studies suggest that UA levels decrease after initiation of hemodialysis (HD). We evaluated UA level and the use of urate-lowering therapies (ULTs) in patients with gout and ESRD on HD.\nMETHODS: We performed a retrospective review of patients with gout and ESRD seen at a large urban public hospital (The MetroHealth System). We extracted data from the medical record (Epic) for patients diagnosed with gout and ESRD on HD. The main outcomes were the UA level and the use of ULTs before and after HD initiation.\nRESULTS: We identified 131 patients with gout on HD. Of these, 21 patients had crystal proven gout diagnosis, 10 of whom had data on UA level pre-HD and post-HD and were included in the analysis. For the total sample (N = 21), the mean age was 65 years, 7 were female and 20 were African American. Mean pre-HD and post-HD UA levels were 8.4 and 3.98 mg\/dL respectively.

        "Abstract":"INTRODUCTION: When initiating urate-lowering therapy, using anti-inflammatory prophylaxis therapy for at least 3 to 6 months is strongly recommended. Previous studies have found that zhengqing fengtongning sustained-release tablets (sinomenine) can improve inflammation in the acute phase of gout; however, the efficacy of urate-lowering therapy in reducing frequency of acute flares still needs to be investigated. The aim of the present study is to explore the efficacy and safety of sinomenine for prophylaxis of acute flares when initiating urate-lowering therapy.\nMETHODS AND ANALYSIS: This randomized, placebo-controlled, double-blinded trial will include a total of 210 gout patients who meet the study criteria. The patients will be randomized (1:1) to the test group and the control group. The intervention is planned to be performed for 12 weeks with a follow-up of 12 weeks. All patients would be administered febuxostat (40 mg\/d) and concomitant anti-inflammatory prophylaxis therapy. Sinomenine and colchicine placebo are administered in the sinomenine group, sinomenine placebo and colchicine are administered in the colchicine group. The primary outcome is the rate of acute gout flares in subjects within 12 weeks of the treatment period. The secondary outcomes include the times of acute gout flares and the duration of each acute flares within 12 weeks; the compliance rate in patients whose UA levels ≤6.0 mg\/dL (360 μmol\/L) at the weekend of 2nd, 4th, 8th, and 12th week in each group; the proportion of patients with ≥1 and ≥2 gout flares within 12 weeks; average visual analogue scale\/score pain score during gout flares; and the oral dose of etoricoxib will be used to control the onset of acute flares within 12 weeks.\nETHICS AND DISSEMINATION: The Institutional Medical Ethics Committee have approved the trial protocol.

Changes from baseline in serum urate level, gout flares, and tophus resolution were key exploratory efficacy parameters in the overall population and in subgroups of patients who died and those who did not die from a CV-related cause. The latter subgroup included patients who died due to non-CV causes and those who did not die due to any cause.\nRESULTS: Patients received treatment with febuxostat (n = 3,098) or allopurinol (n = 3,092) for a median follow-up period of 32 months (for a maximum of 85 months). In the overall population, mean serum urate levels were lower in those receiving febuxostat compared with those receiving allopurinol at most study visits. There were no associations between serum urate levels and death from CV causes with febuxostat. The number of gout flares requiring treatment was higher within 1 year of treatment with febuxostat compared with allopurinol (mean incidence of gout flares per patient-years of exposure 1.33 versus 1.20), but was comparable thereafter and decreased overall throughout the study period (mean incidence of gout flares per patient-years of exposure 0.35 versus 0.34 after 1 year of treatment; overall mean incidence 0.68 versus 0.63) irrespective of whether the patient died from a CV-related cause. Overall, 20.8% of patients had ≥1 tophus at baseline; tophus resolution rates were similar between treatment groups, with cumulative resolution rates of >50%.\nCONCLUSION: In the CARES trial, febuxostat and allopurinol (≤600 mg doses) had comparable efficacy in patients with gout and CV disease, and there was no evidence of a relationship between death from CV causes and serum urate levels, number of gout flares, or tophus resolution among the patients receiving febuxostat.",

Flares were recorded over 2 years. Baseline predictors of flares during months 9-12 in year 1 and during year 2 were analyzed by multivariable logistic regression.\nRESULTS: Of 211 patients included (mean age 56.4 years, disease duration 7.8 years, 95% males), 81% (150\/186) of patients experienced at least one gout flare during the first year and 26% (45\/173) during the second year. The highest frequency of flares in the first year was seen during months 3-6 (46.8% of patients). Baseline crystal depositions detected by ultrasound and by dual-energy computed tomography (DECT) were the only variables which predicted flares both during the first period of interest at months 9-12 (OR 1.033; 95% CI 1.010-1.057, and OR 1.056; 95% CI 1.007-1.108) and also in year 2.

The increase of serum uric acid is tightly related to the incidence of hyperuricemia and gout. Also, it has been reported that the intake of purine-rich foods like meat and seafood is associated with an increased risk of gout. Therefore, the reduction of purine absorption is one of therapeutic approaches to prevent hyperuricemia and gout. Currently, probiotics are being studied for the management of hyperuricemia and gout. In this study, we aimed to investigate the effect of  MJM60390 on hyperuricemia induced by a high-purine diet and potassium oxonate in a mouse model.  MJM60390 among 24 lactic acid bacteria isolated from fermented foods showed the highest ability to assimilate inosine and guanosine  and typical probiotic characteristics, like the absence of bioamine production, D-lactate production, hemolytic activity, as well as tolerance to simulated orogastrointestinal conditions and adherence to Caco-2 cells. In an  animal study, the uric acid level in serum was significantly reduced to a normal level after oral administration of  MJM60390 for 2 weeks. The activity of xanthine oxidase catalyzing the formation of uric acid was also inhibited by 30%. Interestingly, damage to the glomerulus, Bowman's capsule, and tubules in the hyperuricemia model were reversed by supplementation with this strain. Fecal microbiome analysis revealed that  MJM60390 supplementation enhanced the relative abundance of the  family, which produces the short-chain fatty acid butyrate and helps to maintain good gut condition. Therefore, these results demonstrated that  MJM60390 can be a probiotic candidate to prevent hyperuricemia.",

        "Abstract":"BACKGROUND: The relative efficacy and safety of allopurinol and febuxostat when used according to current guidelines for the treatment of hyperuricemia are unknown. This double-blind noninferiority trial examined these issues.\nMETHODS: Participants with gout and hyperuricemia (with at least 33% having stage 3 chronic kidney disease) were randomly assigned to allopurinol or febuxostat in this 72-week trial, with doses titrated to target serum urate. The trial had three phases: titration (weeks 0 to 24), maintenance (weeks 25 to 48), and observation (weeks 49 to 72). Allopurinol and febuxostat were initiated at daily doses of 100 and 40 mg, with maximum titration to 800 and 120 mg, respectively. Antiinflammatory prophylaxis was given during phases 1 and 2. The primary end point was the proportion of patients experiencing one or more flares during phase 3, with a prespecified noninferiority margin of less than 8 percentage points between allopurinol and febuxostat. Secondary end points included efficacy in patients with chronic kidney disease, proportion achieving target serum urate levels, and serious adverse events.\nRESULTS: This study included 940 participants; 20.1% withdrew, with similar proportions in treatment arms. During phase 3, 36.5% of allopurinol-treated participants had one flare or more compared with 43.5% of febuxostat-treated participants (P<0.001 for noninferiority). Overall, 80% of participants achieved mean target urates during phase 2 with no differences by treatment. There were no treatment differences (including cardiovascular events) in serious adverse events.\nCONCLUSIONS: Allopurinol and febuxostat achieved serum urate goals in patients with gout; allopurinol was noninferior to febuxostat in controlling flares.

The onset of gout in the middle of the night is closely related to abnormal liver and gallbladder meridian. The purpose of this study was to investigate the clinical efficacy and possible mechanism of action of Tongbixiao pills in the treatment of hyperuricemia and gouty arthritis. The Tongbixiao pills we used included several traditional Chinese medicines, most of which tonify the spleen; strengthen the liver; benefit the kidney; and reduce heat, dampness, and blood stasis. In this randomized clinical study of 105 patients, we found that Tongbixiao pills can reduce uric acid levels in hyperuricemia patients. Additionally, the efficacy was similar to that of allopurinol and the level of uric acid did not increase significantly at eight weeks after withdrawal. In the absence of notable adverse reactions, Tongbixiao pills can also increase uric acid excretion, reduce serum creatinine and lipid levels, and reduce inflammation and relieve gout symptoms. In addition, we used SD rats to simulate gout and arthritis and divided them into five groups: normal group, model group, low-dose group, medium-dose group, and high-dose group. The inflammatory indices of the 40 SD rats were observed. After seven days, ankle swelling in rats in the treatment group was significantly reduced. The indices of uric acid, creatinine, and urea nitrogen in the treatment group were significantly lower than those in the model group, which proved that Tongbixiao pills could inhibit hyperuricemia in rats, thus treating gout. This study demonstrates that Tongbixiao pills can treat gout, provide more treatment options for gouty arthritis, and improve the quality of life of patients.",

The excessive production or reduced excretion of the purine terminal metabolite may lead to hyperuricemia. In our ongoing search for new xanthine oxidase inhibitors, 14 endophytic fungi were isolated for the first time from a medicinal plant Callicarpa kwangtungensis Chun, and the ethyl acetate extracts of their culture filtrates were screened for XO inhibitory activity. The extract from an endophytic fungus, characterized as Alternaria alternata GDZZ-J6, exhibited the most potent inhibition of XO. Further fractionation of its secondary metabolites led to the isolation of six compounds. Among them, mycotoxin alternariol (AOH), a dibenzo-α-pyrone derivative, had strong inhibitory activity on XO, and the IC value was 0.23 ± 0.01 μM. The potency of XO inhibition by AOH was >12-fold higher as compared to allopurinol (2.98 ± 0.07 μM), a XO inhibitor that has been used clinically. The IC values of three dibenzo-α-pyrones from gut microbial metabolites of ellagic acid, urolithins A, B, and C, against XO were further compared, and their structure-activity relationships were discussed. Inhibition kinetic analysis by double-reciprocal Lineweaver-Burk plots demonstrated that AOH was an uncompetitive inhibitor. Follow-up docking studies showed that Gln957, Lys1257, and Phe1153 played an important role by forming hydrogen bonds with AOH. Our findings suggest that AOH may be used as a lead compound for further modification to develop future drug for treating hyperuricemia.",

        "Abstract":"PURPOSE OF REVIEW: In this review, we report on new findings regarding associations of uric acid with kidney health. We discuss kidney stones, effects of uric acid in chronic kidney disease (CKD), and management of gout in CKD. Recent studies on neuroprotective effects of raising uric acid provide interesting data regarding nephrolithiasis.\nRECENT FINDINGS: Elevated urate levels have been implicated in the progression of chronic kidney disease (CKD), but the results from PERL and CKD-FIX studies did not demonstrate that allopurinol slowed CKD progression. The SURE-PD3 sought to determine if increasing uric acid would slow the progression of Parkinson's disease. Results ultimately did not support this hypothesis, but high urinary uric acid levels caused uric acid stones, not calcium stones. Low urinary pH remains the key to the formation of uric acid stones. Thiazolidinediones improve insulin resistance, which is associated with an increase in urine pH. The most recent research has not supported the hypothesis that lowering serum uric acid levels will slow the progression of CKD or provide neuroprotection in Parkinson's disease. It is still unclear as to why uric acid stone formers have a high net acid excretion. The STOP-GOUT trial demonstrates that there was a lack of significant adverse events with higher urate-lowering dosages of allopurinol and febuxostat, despite patients' kidney function. This may push other studies to administer higher dosages per ACR guidelines. Future studies could then demonstrate decreased progression of CKD.",

From January 2018 to June 2018, there were 45 patients with asymptomatic hyperuricemia in the outpatient or inpatient of Changzhou Second People's Hospital, which were divided into the febuxostat group (25 cases) and the control group (20 cases). We collected the patients' baseline indicators and testing indicators after three months of treatment, including blood urea nitrogen, blood creatinine, blood uric acid, urine microalbumin, urine NGAL, urine KIM-1, and other indicators. The subjects in both groups were given lifestyle intervention, instructed to drink more water, and given a low-purine diet. The patients in the febuxostat group took febuxostat 40 mg\/D or 80 mg\/D. We used SPSS 25.0 statistical software for statistical analysis. Baseline indexes between the febuxostat group and the control group and indexes after treatment between two groups were both performed by independent sample -test, and paired -test was used for self-comparison between the groups before and after treatment. There was no significant difference in age, sex, body mass index (BMI), urea nitrogen, creatinine, uric acid, urine microalbumin\/creatinine, urine NGAL\/creatinine, and urine KIM-1\/creatinine between the two groups before treatment ( > 0.05). Compared with before treatment, after 3 months of intervention, the levels of serum uric acid, urine microalbumin\/creatinine, urine NGAL\/creatinine, and urine KIM-1\/creatinine were significantly decreased in the febuxostat group ( < 0.05), while the changes of blood urea nitrogen, serum creatinine, and epidermal growth factor receptor (eGFR) were not statistically significant ( > 0.05). After 3 months of intervention, the control group had no significant changes in blood urea nitrogen, creatinine, eGFR, uric acid, microalbumin\/creatinine, urine NGAL\/creatinine, and urine KIM-1\/creatinine ( > 0.05). After 3 months of intervention, compared with the control group, the serum uric acid, microalbumin\/creatinine, urine NGAL\/creatinine, and urine KIM-1\/creatinine were significantly decreased in the febuxostat group ( < 0.05), but there was no significant difference in blood urea nitrogen, creatinine, and eGFR ( > 0.05). Febuxostat can reduce urine NGAL\/creatinine and urine KIM-1\/creatinine levels in patients with hyperuricemia and has the protective effects on renal tubular injury caused by hyperuricemia, which can provide evidences for the early prevention and treatment of asymptomatic hyperuricemia.",

        "Abstract":"OBJECTIVES: Elevated serum urate (SU) levels are associated with arterial atherosclerosis and subsequent cardiovascular events. However, an optimal therapeutic target SU level for delaying atherosclerotic progression in patients with hyperuricaemia remains uncertain. The aim of this analysis was to assess an association between changes in SU level and carotid intima-media thickness (IMT) to examine whether an optimal SU concentration exists to delay atherosclerotic progression.\nMETHODS: This was a post hoc analysis of the PRIZE (programme of vascular evaluation under uric acid control by xanthine oxidase inhibitor, febuxostat: multicentre, randomised controlled) study of Japanese adults with asymptomatic hyperuricaemia. The primary endpoint of this analysis was an association between changes in SU levels and mean common carotid artery IMT (CCA-IMT) after 24 months of febuxostat treatment.\nRESULTS: Among subjects treated with febuxostat (n=239), a total of 204 who had both data on SU and mean CCA-IMT at baseline and 24 months were included in this analysis. The mean baseline SU level was 7.7±1.0 mg\/dL, and febuxostat treatment significantly reduced SU concentrations at 24 months (estimated mean change ‒3.051 mg\/dL, 95% CI ‒3.221 to ‒2.882). A multivariable linear regression analysis revealed that a reduction in SU level was associated with changes in mean CCA-IMT values at 24 months (p=0.025). In contrast, the achieved SU concentrations were not associated with changes in mean CCA-IMT at 24 months.\nCONCLUSION: A greater reduction in SU, but not its achieved concentrations, may be associated with delayed progression of carotid IMT in patients with asymptomatic hyperuricaemia treated with febuxostat.\nTRIAL REGISTRATION NUMBER: UMIN000012911.",

This model combines various socio-cognitive theories and assumes behavioral change is a result of becoming aware of the necessity of change by integrating pre-motivational, motivational, and post-motivational factors. An expert group (five gout experts, three health services researchers, and one health behavior expert) was assembled that decided in three meetings on the tool's specific content (assessments and personalized feedback) using information from preparatory qualitative studies and literature reviews. Usability was tested by a think aloud approach and validated usability questionnaires.\nRESULTS: The I-Change Gout tool contains three consecutive sessions comprising 80 questions, 66 tailored textual feedback messages, and 40 tailored animated videos. Navigation through the sessions was determined by the patients' intention to adapt suboptimal ULT adherence. After the sessions, patients receive an overview of the personalized advices and plans to support ULT adherence. Usability testing among 20 gout patients that (ever) used ULT and seven healthcare professionals revealed an overall score for the tool of 8.4 ± 0.9 and 7.7 ± 1.0 (scale 1-10). Furthermore, participants reported a high intention to use and\/or recommend the tool to others. Participants identified some issues for further improvement (e.g. redundant questions, technical issues, and text readability).

        "Published":"2022-03-30",
        "Abstract":"Gout, the most common inflammatory arthritis worldwide, is an auto-inflammatory metabolic disease that leads to monosodium urate crystal deposition. Hyperuricaemia is a significant risk factor for the development of gout; however, hyperuricaemia alone is not sufficient to induce gout.Gout flares have circadian rhythms. Gout flares vary during the day and have strong seasonality, with flares being more common in the spring. The reasons for the predominance of flares in the spring are unclear since serum urate (SU) levels show seasonal variation; however, SU levels are highest in the summer.Immune function varies significantly throughout the year, with enhanced immune responses increasing during the winter. In addition, chronic disruption of circadian rhythms is associated with metabolic syndrome and diseases driven by metabolism. The most telling example relates to Xanthine oxidase (XOD\/XDH). The analysis of XOD\/XDH established its circadian regulation and demonstrated that inhibition of the activity of XOD is characterised by distinct, crossregulating diurnal\/seasonal patterns of activity.The gastrointestinal microbiota of gout patients is highly distinct from healthy individuals. In a small series of gout patients, Bacteroides caccae and Bacteroides xylanisolvens were found to be enriched. Bacteroidales levels were highest during the spring and summer, and loading values were highest in the spring.Our review discusses gout's circadian rhythm and seasonality, possible influences of the microbiome on gout due to our new knowledge that Bacteroidales levels were highest during spring when gout is most common, and potential opportunities for treatment based on our current understanding of this interaction.",

Whether xanthine oxidoreductase inhibitors (XORIs) have a renoprotective effect in DKD patients with type 2 diabetes remains controversial. We conducted a proof-of-concept study to investigate the renal effects of a novel XORI, TMX-049, in patients with DKD and type 2 diabetes.\nMETHODS: This is a multicenter, 12-week, randomized, double-blind, placebo-controlled phase 2a trial conducted at 49 centers across the United States between April 2018 and June 2019. In total, 130 patients with type 2 diabetes, urine albumin-creatinine ratio (UACR) 200 - 3000 mg\/g, eGFR ≥30 ml\/min per 1.73 m, and serum uric acid (sUA) 4 - 10 mg\/dl were randomized 1:1:1 to TMX-049 200 mg (=44) or 40 mg (=44), or placebo (=42). The primary end point was change in log-transformed UACR at week 12 from baseline. The secondary end points included changes in UACR, eGFR, and sUA from baseline.\nRESULTS: The least squares mean differences for changes in log-transformed UACR from baseline to week 12 compared with placebo were -0.43 (95% confidence interval [95% CI], -0.82 to -0.04, =0.03) for TMX-049 200 mg and -0.05 (95% CI, -0.44 to 0.34, =0.80) for 40 mg; a 35% reduction in UACR was observed with TMX-049 200 mg (ratio versus placebo, 0.65; 95% CI, 0.44 to 0.96) but not 40 mg (0.95; 95% CI, 0.64 to 1.41). Throughout the treatment period, marked reductions in sUA levels but no changes in eGFR were observed with both TMX-049 doses. TMX-049 was generally well tolerated, although two patients with TMX-049 200 mg developed gout.\nCONCLUSIONS: TMX-049 200 mg reduced albuminuria at 12 weeks in patients with DKD and type 2 diabetes.

Patients with persistent urate-lowering to <1 mg\/dL in response to biweekly pegloticase (responders, n=36) were compared to those who received placebo (n=43). NAFLD was assessed using the Fibrosis-4 (Fib-4) index. Comparisons between groups were carried out using 2 sample Wilcoxon tests or regression analysis.\nRESULTS: At baseline the mean (standard deviation [SD]) Fib-4 values were 1.40 (0.86) in pegloticase responders, and 1.04 (0.53) in patients receiving placebo. Patients receiving placebo exhibited a change of 0.26 (0.41) in Fib-4 score over 6 months vs 0.13 (0.62) for pegloticase responders (p=0.048). When only patients with a Fib-4 value >1.3 were considered (n=27), a significant difference in the change in the Fib-4 values between pegloticase responders vs. placebo was observed (-0.15 [0.67] vs. 0.7 [0.42], p=0.04). The correlation between the SU area under the curve (AUC) over the 6-month trial period and the change in Fib-4 value was R=0.33 (p=0.0004). Multivariable analysis indicated SU AUC was the only significant contributor to the change in Fib-4 values (p=0.018).\nCONCLUSIONS: Persistent lowering of SU significantly reduced Fib-4 scores, implying a possible effect on NAFLD progression.

First, in the Renoprotective Effects of Dapagliflozin in Type 2 Diabetes study, 44 people with type 2 diabetes were randomized to dapagliflozin or gliclazide for 12 weeks. Plasma uric acid, fractional uric acid excretion, and hemodynamic kidney function were measured in the fasted state and during clamped euglycemia or hyperglycemia. Second, in the Uric Acid Excretion study, ten people with type 2 diabetes received 1 week of empagliflozin, urate transporter 1 blocker benzbromarone, or their combination in a crossover design, and effects on plasma uric acid, fractional uric acid excretion, and 24-hour uric acid excretion were measured.\nRESULTS: In the Renoprotective Effects of Dapagliflozin in Type 2 Diabetes study, compared with the fasted state (5.3±1.1 mg\/dl), acute hyperinsulinemia and hyperglycemia significantly reduced plasma uric acid by 0.2±0.3 and 0.4±0.3 mg\/dl (both <0.001) while increasing fractional uric acid excretion (by 3.2%±3.1% and 8.9%±4.5%, respectively; both <0.001). Dapagliflozin reduced plasma uric acid by 0.8±0.8 during fasting, 1.0±1.0 in hyperinsulinemic-euglycemic state, and 0.8±0.7 mg\/dl during hyperglycemic conditions (<0.001), respectively, whereas fractional uric acid excretion in 24-hour urine increased by 3.0%±2.1% (<0.001) and 2.6%±4.5% during hyperinsulinemic-euglycemic conditions (=0.003). Fractional uric acid excretion strongly correlated to fractional glucose excretion (=0.35; =0.02).

Recombinant uricase is increasingly being used to treat refractory gout; however, the immunogenicity of uricase-based therapies has limited the use of these biologic therapies. Antidrug antibodies against biologic therapies, including uricase and PEGylated uricase, can lead to loss of urate-lowering response, increased risk of infusion reactions, and subsequent treatment failure. However, co-therapy with an immunomodulator can attenuate antidrug antibody development, potentially increasing the likelihood of sustained urate lowering, therapy course completion, and successful treatment outcomes.

Dual-energy computed tomography (DECT) non-invasively detects MSU deposition, including subclinical deposition, quantifies MSU volumes and depicts bone erosions. This report presents DECT findings in MIRROR open-label trial participants receiving pegloticase+MTX co-therapy.\nMETHODS: Serial DECT scans were obtained during pegloticase (8 mg biweekly infusions)+oral MTX (15 mg\/week) co-therapy. Bilateral hand\/wrist, elbow, foot\/ankle and knee images were analysed with default post-processing settings. MSU volumes were quantified and bone erosions were identified and evaluated for remodelling (decreased size, sclerosis, new bone formation). DECT and physical examination findings were compared.\nRESULTS: 2 patients underwent serial DECT. Patient 1 (44-year-old male) completed 52 weeks of pegloticase+MTX co-therapy (26 infusions). Baseline examination detected 4 tophus-affected joints while DECT identified 73 MSU-affected joints (total MSU volume: 128.76 cm3). At end-of-treatment, there were no clinically-affected joints and 4 joints with DECT-detected MSU deposition. MSU volume decreased by 99% and bone erosion remodelling was evident.

        "Abstract":"OBJECTIVE: To identify predictors of admission following emergency department (ED) attendances for gout flares and to describe barriers to optimal inpatient gout care.\nMETHODS: ED attendances and hospital admissions with primary diagnoses of gout were analyzed at 2 UK-based hospitals between January 1, 2017, and December 31, 2020. Demographic and clinical predictors of ED disposition (admission or discharge) and reattendance for gout flares were identified using logistic regression and survival models, respectively. Case note reviews (n = 59), stakeholder meetings, and process mapping were performed to capture detailed information on gout management and to identify strategies to optimize care.\nRESULTS: Of 1220 emergency attendances for gout flares, 23.5% required hospitalization (median length of stay: 3.6 days). Recurrent attendances for flares occurred in 10.4% of patients during the study period. In multivariate logistic regression models, significant predictors of admission from ED were older age, overnight ED arrival time, higher serum urate (SU), higher C-reactive protein, and higher total white cell count at presentation. Detailed case note reviews showed that only 22.6% of patients with preexisting gout were receiving urate-lowering therapy (ULT) at presentation. Initial diagnostic uncertainty was common, yet rheumatology input and synovial aspirates were rarely obtained. By 6 months postdischarge, 43.6% were receiving ULT; however, few patients had treat-to-target dose optimization, and only 9.1% achieved SU levels ≤ 360 μmol\/L.\nCONCLUSION: We identified multiple predictors of hospitalization for acute gout. Treat-to-target optimization of ULT following hospitalization remains inadequate and must be improved if admissions are to be prevented.",

To date, the groups of patients with chronic kidney disease (CKD) requiring urate-lowering therapy are clinically unknown. Herein, we evaluated the efficacy of febuxostat using a cross-classification, attribute-based research approach. We performed post hoc analysis of multicenter, randomized, double-blind, placebo-controlled trial data for 395 patients with stage 3 CKD and asymptomatic hyperuricemia. Participants were divided into febuxostat or placebo groups and subcohorts stratified and cross-classified by proteinuria and serum creatinine concentrations. In patients stratified based on proteinuria, the mean eGFR slopes were significantly higher in the febuxostat group than in the placebo group (P = 0.007) in the subcohort without proteinuria. The interaction between febuxostat treatment and presence of proteinuria in terms of eGFR slope was significant (P for interaction = 0.019). When cross-classified by the presence of proteinuria and serum creatinine level, the mean eGFR slopes significantly differed between the febuxostat and placebo groups (P = 0.040) in cross-classified subcohorts without proteinuria and with serum creatinine level ≥ median, but not in the cross-classified subcohorts with proteinuria and serum creatinine level < median.

        "Abstract":"BACKGROUND: Hyperuricemia has been associated with the development of hypertension, cardiovascular, and renal disease. However, there is no data about the effect of lowering uric acid level on renal functions and proteinuria in renal transplant recipients. This study aimed to investigate the effect of allopurinol treatment on renal functions in renal transplant recipients (RTR).\nMETHODS: A total of 245 patients with renal transplantation were included in this randomized, placebo-controlled study. Patients were randomized to receive either placebo (121 patients) or 300 mg\/day allopurinol (124 patients). We have examined uric acid, urinary protein creatinin ratio, MDRD (the modification of diet in renal diseases) and CRP (C-reactive protein) before and 24 weeks after treatment in both group.\nRESULTS: In the allopurinol group, the mean serum uric acid levels, eGFR (estimated glomerular filtration rate), and creatinine urinary albumin creatinin ratio (UACR) significantly improved (p < 0.001). Also uric acid level was positively correlated with the UACR (r = 0,645 p < 0.001) and negatively correlated with MDRD (r = -0,387 p < 0.05) in allopurinol treatment group. A statistically significant increase in CRP level was observed (p < 0,05) in plasebo group. Multivariate regression analysis showed that uric acid was positively correlated with UACR (r = 0,473, β = 0.021, p = 0.002) and negatively correlated with MDRD (r = -0554 β = 0.016, P = 0.001) in allopurinol treatment RTR.\nCONCLUSION: Urate, a salt of uric acid, is lowered by allopurinol treatment resulting in improved eGFR and decreased proteinuria, when compared to the placebo group. Therefore, we suggest that allopurinol therapy should be part of the management of kidney transplant patients with normal kidney function. Long-term follow-up studies will be useful in revealing the effect of uric acid management on kidney functions and proteinuria.",

However, the effectiveness of benzbromarone versus febuxostat in reducing serum urate in gouty patients classified with different types of hyperuricaemia remains unclear.\nMETHOD: In this retrospective study from January 1, 2018, to September 30, 2020, subjects were identified if they were newly treated with benzbromarone 25 mg daily or febuxostat 20 mg daily. The subjects were classified into four types according to their 24-h urinary uric acid and fractional excretion of uric acid. The baseline data and follow-up information after 28 ± 3 days of treatment were collected.\nRESULTS: Seventy-three subjects with gout were finally enrolled. Among them, 50 were treated with benzbromarone. The percent changes in serum urate from the baseline were - 33.71 ± 13.59% and - 29.45 ± 10.62% in the benzbromarone and febuxostat group, respectively, without a significant difference between the groups (P = 0.188). No differences were found between the groups in subjects classified as the renal underexcretion type, combined type, or \"normal\" type. In patients with eGFR ≥ 70 mL\/min\/1.73 m, the rate of serum urate lowering was higher in those treated with benzbromarone than in those treated with febuxostat. Febuxostat treatment significantly lowered serum creatinine from the baseline (P = 0.001).\nCONCLUSIONS: Benzbromarone 25 mg daily and febuxostat 20 mg daily may have comparable effectiveness in lowering the serum urate among different types of hyperuricaemia. Benzbromarone was more effective than febuxostat in lowering serum urate in subjects with eGFR ≥ 70 mL\/min\/1.73 m, while febuxostat had a renal protective effect.

        "Abstract":".-\n['2', '2']\nSerum uric acid (SUA) is significantly elevated in obesity, gout, type 2 diabetes mellitus, and the metabolic syndrome and appears to contribute to the renal, cardiovascular and pulmonary comorbidities that are associated with these disorders. Most previous studies have focused on the pathophysiologic effects of high levels of uric acid (hyperuricemia). More recently, research has also shifted to the impact of hypouricemia, with multiple studies showing the potentially damaging effects that can be caused by abnormally low levels of SUA. Along with these observations, recent inconclusive data from human studies evaluating the treatment of hyperuricemia with xanthine oxidoreductase (XOR) inhibitors have added to the debate about the causal role of UA in human disease processes. SUA, which is largely derived from hepatic degradation of purines, appears to exert both systemic pro-inflammatory effects that contribute to disease and protective antioxidant properties. XOR, which catalyzes the terminal two steps of purine degradation, is the major source of both reactive oxygen species (O2, HO) and UA. This review will summarize the evidence that both elevated and low SUA may be risk factors for renal, cardiovascular and pulmonary comorbidities. It will also discuss the mechanisms through which modulation of either XOR activity or SUA may contribute to vascular redox hemostasis. We will address future research studies to better account for the differential effects of high versus low SUA in the hope that this will identify new evidence-based approaches for the management of hyperuricemia.",

Thus, we investigated whether allopurinol and febuxostat, the most frequently used urate-lowering treatments, have differential renoprotective effects on chronic kidney disease.\nMETHODS: Incident users of allopurinol and febuxostat were identified from two tertiary referral centers. One-to-one propensity score matching between the allopurinol and febuxostat groups was performed. Participants were followed up until the occurrence of clinical outcomes, urate-lowering agent discontinuation, mortality, or the end of the study period, whichever occurred first. The primary outcomes were a 30% decline in estimated glomerular filtration rate (eGFR) and end-stage renal disease. Differential trends of eGFR decline were estimated using a linear mixed-effects model.\nRESULTS: Each group included 654 participants. Baseline eGFRs were 40.1 [26.6-57.3] and 39.1 [27.9-58.3] mL\/min\/1.73 m2 in the allopurinol and febuxostat group, respectively. Adjusted least square mean change in serum urate was -1.58 mg\/dL [95% confidence interval (CI), -1.78 to -1.38] and -2.69 mg\/dL (95% CI, -2.89 to -2.49) in the allopurinol and febuxostat groups, respectively. Despite lower serum urate levels, febuxostat was significantly more associated with a 30% decline in eGFR (hazard ratio 1.26; 95% CI 1.03-1.54) and end-stage renal disease (hazard ratio 1.91, 95% CI 1.42-2.58) than allopurinol. Annual eGFR decline in febuxostat users was estimated to be more rapid than in allopurinol users by 2.14 (standard error 0.71) mL\/min\/1.73 m2 per year.\nCONCLUSIONS: Allopurinol demonstrated attenuation of chronic kidney disease progression and prevention of hypouricemia, compared to febuxostat. Because the treatment can be renoprotective, further studies on its effects on chronic kidney disease are required.",

        "Abstract":"SARS-CoV-2 by the direct cytopathic effect or indirectly through the propagation of pro-inflammatory cytokines could cause endothelial dysfunction (ED) and oxidative stress (OS). It has been reported that OS is triggered by various types of viral infections, including SARS-CoV-2. Into the bargain, allopurinol is regarded as a potent antioxidant that acts through inhibition of xanthine oxidase (XO), which is an essential enzyme of purine metabolism. Herein, the present study aimed to find the potential protective effects of allopurinol on the biomarkers of OS and ED in patients with severe Covid-19. This single-center cohort study recruited 39 patients with mild-moderate Covid-19 compared with 41 patients with severe Covid-19. Nineteen patients with severe Covid-19 were on the allopurinol treatment because of underlying chronic gout 3 years ago compared with 22 Covid-19 patients not on this treatment. The recruited patients were allocated into three groups: group I, mild-moderate Covid-19 on the standard therapy (n = 39); group II, severe Covid-19 patients on the standard therapy only (n = 22); and group III, severe Covid-19 patients on the standard therapy plus allopurinol (n = 19). The duration of the study was 3 weeks from the time of hospitalization till the time of recovery. In addition, inflammatory biomarkers (D-dimer, LDH, ferritin, CRP, procalcitonin), neutrophil-lymphocyte ratio (NLR), endothelin-1 (ET-1), uric acid and oxidative stress index (OSI), CT scan score, and clinical score were evaluated at the time of admission and discharge regarding the effect of allopurinol treatment adds to the standard treatment of Covid-19. Allopurinol plus standard treatment reduced LDH, ferritin, CRP, procalcitonin, and ET-1 serum level significantly (P < 0.05) compared with Covid-19 patients on standard treatment. Besides, neutrophil (%), lymphocyte (%), and neutrophil-lymphocyte ratio (NLR) were reduced in patients with severe Covid-19 on standard treatment plus allopurinol compared with Covid-19 patients on standard treatment alone (P < 0.01). OSI was higher in patients with severe Covid-19 than mild-moderate Covid-19 patients (P = 0.00001) at admission. At the time of discharge, the oxidative status of Covid-19 patients was significantly improved compared with that at admission (P = 0.01). In conclusion, Covid-19 severity is linked with high OS and inflammatory reaction with ED development. High uric acid in patients with severe Covid-19 is correlated with high OS and inflammatory biomarkers. Allopurinol with standard treatment in patients with severe Covid-19 reduced oxidative and inflammatory disorders with significant amelioration of ED and clinical outcomes.",

This study describes the development of a decision aid (DA) that supports patients with gout and their physicians in a face-to-face clinical setting to (a) decide whether or not to (re)start urate-lowering therapy (ULT) and (b) agree on the preferred ULT.\nMETHODS: Recommendations of the International Patient Decision Aid Standards group guided the development. A steering group of experts in gout and health services research specified the scope. Nominal group technique meetings were organised in which patients ranked the importance of preidentified potential characteristics\/attributes of ULT and discussed further needs regarding the DA. A literature search was conducted to collect evidence on gout outcomes with and without ULT. Subsequently, the DA prototype was designed and adjusted using feedback from the steering group and results of cognitive debriefing interviews among five gout patients.\nRESULTS: The final DA consists of six pages. First, the DA clarifies the decision at stake and describes gout including its risk factors, the role of lifestyle and treatment of flares. Next, risk of future flares with and without ULT in relation to serum uric acid levels is described and visualised.

        "Abstract":"PURPOSE: Here, we aimed to elucidate the differences in microbiota composition between patients with gout and those with asymptomatic hyperuricemia (asHU) and determine the effect of uric acid-lowering therapy (ULT) on the gut microbiome.\nMATERIALS AND METHODS: Stool samples from patients with asHU (n=8) and three groups of gout patients, i.e., acute gout patients before ULT (0ULT, n=14), the same acute gout patients after 30-day ULT (30ULT, n=9), and chronic gout patients after ≥6-month ULT (cULT, n=18) were collected and analyzed using 16S rRNA gene-based pyrosequencing. The composition of microbial taxonomy and communities, species diversity, and relationships among microbial communities were elucidated by bioinformatic analysis.\nRESULTS: Gout patients showed less diverse gut microbiota than asHU patients. The microbiota of the asHU group exhibited a higher -to (F\/B) ratio and lower -to (P\/B) ratio than the gout group; significantly, the F\/B ratio increased in gout patients after ULT. Moreover, a balanced enterotype populated asHU patients compared to gout patients. Notably, the gut microbiota in asHU patients had a higher proportion of taxa with potentially anti-inflammatory effects compared to the gut microbiota in gout patients.\nCONCLUSION: We found that microbial composition differs between asHU and gout patients. The differential gut microbiota in asHU patients may protect against gout development, whereas that in gout patients may have a role in gout provocation. ULT in gout patients altered the gut microbiota, and may help alleviate gout pathology and mitigate gout progression.",

        "Abstract":"Atherosclerosis and arterial stiffness are phenotypes of atherosclerotic vascular damage. Atherosclerosis originates from endothelial vascular damage and forms focal morphological lesions; arterial stiffness originates from diffuse medial-layer damage in the arterial tree. Thus, the two phenomena reflect different facets of atherosclerotic vascular damage, and they both gradually progress. We conducted a subanalysis to compare the long-term effects of febuxostat on atherosclerosis and arterial stiffness in the PRIZE study (a multicenter, prospective, randomized, open-label, blinded-endpoint clinical trial to examine the effect of febuxostat on carotid atherosclerosis). Among 514 study participants, arterial stiffness parameters (brachial-ankle pulse wave velocity or cardio-ankle vascular index) were obtained at baseline, 12 months, and 24 months in 100 subjects. Among them, 48 subjects were allocated to the control group (i.e., nonpharmacological lifestyle modification for hyperuricemia), and 52 subjects were allocated to the febuxostat treatment group. While the decrease in serum uric acid was greater in the febuxostat group than in the control group, the adjusted percentage decrease in arterial stiffness parameters at month 24 was greater in the febuxostat group than in the control group, with a mean between-group difference (febuxostat - control) of -5.099% (95% confidence interval (CI) -10.009% to -0.188%, p = 0.042). Thus, long-term treatment with febuxostat may exert beneficial effects on arterial stiffness without improving carotid atherosclerosis. A long-term study to examine the effect of febuxostat on cardiovascular outcomes related to increased arterial stiffness is warranted.",

        "Abstract":"PURPOSE OF REVIEW: Gout is a systemic disease from which some patients develop numerous painful tophi that adversely affect quality of life and functionality. Some patients treated with oral urate-lowering therapy are unable to maintain serum urate levels below 6 mg\/dL, and these patients, thus classified as having refractory or uncontrolled gout, often require therapy with pegloticase to reduce symptoms and tophaceous burden. The objective of this expert opinion review is to summarize the available evidence supporting the use of concomitant immunomodulators with pegloticase to prevent development of anti-drug antibodies (ADAs) when treating patients with uncontrolled gout.\nRECENT FINDINGS: Emerging evidence suggests that adding an immunomodulator to pegloticase therapy can substantially increase response rates to double those observed in phase 3 randomized controlled trials. The combination of immunomodulation with pegloticase should be considered in routine clinical practice to improve durability of response, efficacy, and safety among patients with uncontrolled gout who otherwise have limited therapeutic options.",

This study examined the association between long-term colchicine use and risk of adverse kidney outcome in patients with CKD who were treated for hyperuricaemia or chronic gout.\nMETHODS: We conducted a multicentre, nested, case-control study in three Korean hospitals. Patients were aged ≥19 years; had CKD G3-G4; and used drugs including colchicine, allopurinol and febuxostat for hyperuricaemia or chronic gout during the period from April 2000 to October 2020. Patients with CKD progression, which was defined as ≥40% decrease from the baseline estimated glomerular filtration rate or the onset of kidney failure with replacement therapy, were matched to controls based on follow-up time, age and sex.\nRESULTS: Overall, 3085 patients with CKD progression were matched to 11 715 control patients. Multivariate conditional logistic regression analysis showed that patients with ≥90 cumulative daily colchicine doses were associated with a lower risk of CKD progression [adjusted odds ratio (AOR), 0.77; 95% CI: 0.61, 0.96] than non-users. In the sensitivity analysis with matched CKD stages, the AOR was 0.77 (95% CI: 0.62, 0.97).

        "Abstract":"BACKGROUND: Hyperuricemia is an independent risk factor for diabetic kidney disease (DKD) progression. Previous animal and cohort studies have reported that allopurinol administration could be of therapeutic benefit in diabetic subjects. However, there has been controversy regarding the effects of allopurinol on DKD.\nOBJECTIVES: The aim of our study was to investigate the efficacy of allopurinol on renal function in patients with DKD by meta-analysis of randomized controlled trials.\nMETHOD: PubMed, EMBASE, and the Cochrane Library were searched from inception to October 2020. The primary outcome was a change in glomerular filtration rate (GFR). The secondary outcome was the change in albuminuria and serum uric acid (UA). Two reviewers independently assessed for risk of bias and extracted data. Standardized mean difference (SMD) or weighted mean difference (WMD) was calculated with random effects models and was reported with corresponding 95% confidence intervals (CIs). Grading of Recommendations Assessment, Development, and Evaluation (GRADE) of the evidence was performed after meta-analysis. International prospective register of systematic reviews registration CRD42020219132.\nRESULTS: From 642 potentially relevant citations, 3 studies were ultimately included. Our results showed evident reduction in serum UA after allopurinol intervention (WMD = -103.80, 95% CI -159.05, -48.55, I2 = 76%; p = 0.04), with a high GRADE of evidence. However, allopurinol did not significantly improve GFR (WMD = 1.07, 95% CI -1.68, 3.82, I2 = 33%; p = 0.45), with a moderate GRADE of evidence.

This study aimed to determine the effects of AHU treatment with allopurinol on selected hypertension-mediated organ damage (HMOD) indices in patients with uncomplicated essential arterial hypertension (AH).\nMETHODS: Patients aged 30-70 years with AHU and AH grade 1-2 with adequate blood pressure (BP) control, without previous urate-lowering therapy (ULT), were divided into two groups: (a) ULT (receiving allopurinol) and (b) control (age- and sex-matched patients without ULT). Both received a UA-lowering diet. BP (office, 24 h and central), echocardiographic parameters, carotid intima-media thickness (IMT) and lab tests [high-sensitivity C-reactive protein (hs-CRP)] were measured at baseline and at 6 months follow-up.\nRESULTS: Of 100 participants, 87 (44 ULT, 43 controls) completed the study. At 6 months follow-up, there was a greater reduction in serum UA concentration in the ULT group than in the control group.

        "Abstract":"INTRODUCTION: Achieving a goal of serum urate levels in patients with gout is an important way to prevent gout and its complications while it remains difficult with a low targeting rate worldwidely. Currently, hyperuricemia classification has not been widely applied to the management of gout owing to insufficient clinical evidences. This study aimed to evaluate the effectiveness of achieving target urate based on hyperuricemia classification in Chinese patients with gout.\nMETHODS: In this prospective study, patients with gout receiving urate lowering therapy with benzbromarone were assigned to two groups, a renal underexcretion and an unclassified type. The primary endpoint was the proportion of patients achieving the serum urate target (<360 μmol\/L) during the 12-week study. The frequency of acute gout attacks as well as physical and chemical indicators were secondary endpoints.\nRESULTS: Target serum urate level was achieved in 60.5% of underexcretors compared with 39.0% of patients of the unclassified type at week 12 ( = 0.002). Blood glucose and cholesterol levels were lower in the underexcretor group compared with the unclassified type group at the end of the trial, without significant different frequencies in gout flare during the study. In subgroup analysis, stratified by body mass index and estimated glomerular filtration rate, the proportion of patients with serum urate <360 μmol\/L was greater in the underexcretion compared with the unclassified type group.\nCONCLUSIONS: The increased achievement of target serum urate in the underexcretion group supports the use of a clinical hyperuricemia typing treatment strategy for gout.",

ULT options febuxostat, allopurinol and no ULT were considered. Flare treatments naproxen, colchicine, prednisone, and anakinra were considered. A Markov Model was constructed to simulate gout disease. Health states were no flare, and severe pain, mild pain, moderate pain, or no pain in the presence of a flare. Model input was derived from patient level clinical trial data, meta-analyses or from previously published health-economic evaluations. The results of probabilistic sensitivity analyses were presented using incremental cost-effectiveness ratios (ICERs), and summarized using cost-effectiveness acceptability curves (CEACs). Scenario analyses were performed.\nRESULTS: The ICER for allopurinol versus no ULT was €1,381, when combined with naproxen. Febuxostat yielded the highest utility, but also the highest costs (€4,385 vs. €4,063 for allopurinol), resulting in an ICER of €25,173 when compared to allopurinol. No ULT was not cost-effective, yielding the lowest utility. For the gout flare medications, comparable effects on utility were achieved. Combined with febuxostat, naproxen was the cheapest option (€4,404), and anakinra the most expensive (€4,651). The ICER of anakinra compared to naproxen was €818,504. Colchicine and prednisone were dominated by naproxen.\nCONCLUSION: Allopurinol and febuxostat were both cost-effective compared to No ULT. Febuxostat was cost-effective in comparison with allopurinol at higher willingness-to-pay thresholds.

        "Abstract":"['Helianthus annuus', 'via']\nThe sunflower ( L.) calathide is gradually used as an alternative treatment for hyperuricemia; nevertheless, evidence regarding its main components and therapeutic capacity for urate nephropathy is lacking. Identification of sunflower calathide aqueous extract (SCE) was rapidly done by UPLC-ESI-Q-Orbitrap, and 32 water-soluble compounds with a comprehensive score >80 were discovered. Besides, yeast extract was administrated to induce high UA levels and hyperuricemic renal injury. We found that SCE treatment not only decreased UA levels to a comparable degree as allopurinol and benzbromarone, but also reduced the BUN levels and participated in kidney injury repair induced by uric acid. Moreover, it regulated the expression of URAT1 and ABCG2, especially inhibiting the GLUT9 in the normal kidney. Results were multifacetedly evaluated with a view to suggesting a possible mechanism of action as compared with those of allopurinol and benzbromarone by western blotting, H&E staining, and immunohistochemistry. However, the H&E staining showed histological changes in model, benzbromarone, and allopurinol groups rather than SCE treatments, and at the same time, the uric acid was identified as a cause of renal damage. The antiinflammatory effects and the regulations of COX-2\/PGE2 signaling pathway were revealed on the LPS-induced RAW264.7 cells, indicating that the SCE not only increased cellular proliferation but also downregulated the COX-2, PGE2, NO, and IFN-γ cytokines in the RAW264.7 cells. To conclude, the SCE acts on urate transporters and contributes to prevent urate nephropathy  alleviating inflammatory process involving COX-2\/PGE2 signaling pathway. It is available to develop SCE as food supplemental applications for hyperuricemia and nephritic inflammation.",

        "Abstract":"BACKGROUND: The benefits of xanthine oxidase inhibitors to chronic heart failure (CHF) patients is controversial. We investigated the beneficial effects of a novel xanthine oxidoreductase inhibitor, topiroxostat, in patients with CHF and hyperuricemia (HU), in comparison to allopurinol.\nMETHODS AND RESULTS: The prospective, randomized open-label, blinded-end-point study was performed in 141 patients with CHF and HU at 4 centers. Patients were randomly assigned to either topiroxostat or allopurinol group to achieve target uric acid level ≤6.0 mg\/dL. According to the protocol, 140 patients were followed up for 24 weeks. Percent change in ln (N-terminal-proB-type natriuretic peptide) at week 24 (primary endpoint) was comparable between topiroxostat and allopurinol groups (1.6±8.2 versus -0.4±8.0%; P = 0.17). In the limited number of patients with heart failure with reduced ejection fraction (HFrEF) (left ventricle ejection fraction <45%), ratio of peak early diastolic flow velocity at mitral valve leaflet to early diastolic mitral annular motion velocity (E\/e') decreased in topiroxostat group, but not in allopurinol group. Urinary 8-hydroxy-2'-deoxyguanosine and L-type fatty acid-binding protein levels increased and osmolality decreased significantly in allopurinol group, while these changes were less or absent in topiroxostat group. In allopurinol group HFrEF patients, additional to the increases in these urinary marker levels, urinary creatinine levels decreased, with no change in clearance, but not in topiroxostat group.\nCONCLUSIONS: Compared with allopurinol, topiroxostat did not show great benefits in patients with CHF and HU. However, topiroxostat might have potential advantages of reducing left ventricular end-diastolic pressure, not worsening oxidative stress in proximal renal tubule, and renoprotection over allopurinol in HFrEF patients.",

        "Abstract":"Hyperuricemia is caused by reduced renal\/extrarenal excretion and overproduction of uric acid. It is affected by genetic predisposition related to uric acid transporters and by visceral fat accumulation due to overnutrition. The typical symptomatic complication of hyperuricemia is gout caused by monosodium urate crystals. Accumulated evidence from epidemiological studies suggests that hyperuricemia is also a risk factor for hypertension, chronic kidney disease (CKD) and atherosclerotic cardiovascular disease (CVD). However, it remains to be determined whether urate-lowering therapy for asymptomatic patients with hyperuricemia is effective in preventing CKD or CVD progression. This mini review focuses mainly on recent papers investigating the relationship between hyperuricemia and CKD or CVD and studies of urate-lowering therapy. Accumulated studies have proposed mechanisms of renal damage and atherosclerosis in hyperuricemia, including inflammasome activation, decreased nitric oxide bioavailability and oxidative stress induced by uric acid, urate crystals and xanthine oxidoreductase (XOR)-mediated reactive oxygen species. Since patients with hyperuricemia are a heterogeneous population with complex pathologies, it may be important to assess whether an outcome is the result of decreasing serum uric acid levels or an inhibitory effect on XOR. To clarify the impact of hyperuricemia on CKD and CVD progression, high-quality and detailed clinical and basic science studies of hyperuricemia and purine metabolism are needed.",

        "Abstract":"PURPOSE: Hyperuricemia is associated with increased cardiovascular risk. Because patients with asymptomatic hyperuricemia (AH) experience no immediate discomfort and there are possible side effects of urate-lowering drugs, treatment for AH is controversial. We aimed to perform a network meta-analysis (NMA) to investigate the effects of different urate-lowering therapies (ULTs) on serum uric acid level, renal function, blood pressure (BP), and safety in AH patients.\nMETHODS: This NMA focused on AH patients. The intervention group (patients receiving urate-lowering drugs) was compared with others using other types of drugs, placebo, or usual care. We undertook a NMA under the frequentist framework by R.\nRESULTS: Thirteen eligible trials were identified. The interventions included allopurinol, febuxostat, and benzbromarone, which are not approved in the United States. Benzbromarone and allopurinol had the best efficacy on lowering serum uric acid level in short-term and long-term follow-up (mean difference [MD] = -3.05; 95% CI, -5.19 to -0.91 vs MD = -3.17; 95% CI, -5.19 to -1.15). Patients using allopurinol had significantly higher eGFR than using placebo in both short-term and long-term follow-up (MD = 3.07; 95% CI, 0.18 to 5.95 vs MD = 4.10; 95% CI, 2.66 to 5.54). No difference in BP was found between groups, except for febuxostat to diastolic BP after long-term treatment (MD = -1.47; 95% CI, -2.91 to -0.04). No statistically increased odds of safety events were found with the use of ULT.\nCONCLUSIONS: Our result showed that in AH patients, allopurinol has a renoprotective effect. Febuxostat has a significant impact in lowering diastolic BP. ULT does not result in a higher risk of safety events.",

        "Abstract":"Biologic drugs have transformed the standard of care for many diseases. However, many biologics induce the formation of anti-drug antibodies (ADAs), which can compromise their safety and efficacy. Preclinical studies demonstrate that biodegradable nanoparticles-encapsulating rapamycin (ImmTOR), but not free rapamycin, mitigate the immunogenicity of co-administered biologic drugs. Here we report the outcomes from two clinical trials for ImmTOR. In the first ascending dose, open-label study (NCT02464605), pegadricase, an immunogenic, pegylated uricase enzyme derived from Candida utilis, is assessed for safety and tolerability (primary endpoint) as well as activity and immunogenicity (secondary endpoint); in the second single ascending dose Phase 1b trial (NCT02648269) composed of both a double-blind and open-label parts, we evaluate the safety of ImmTOR (primary endpoint) and its ability to prevent the formation of anti-drug antibodies against pegadricase and enhance its pharmacodynamic activity (secondary endpoint) in patients with hyperuricemia. The combination of ImmTOR and pegadricase is well tolerated. ImmTOR inhibits the development of uricase-specific ADAs in a dose-dependent manner, thus enabling sustained enzyme activity and reduction in serum uric acid levels. ImmTOR may thus represent a feasible approach for preventing the formation of ADAs to a broad range of immunogenic biologic therapies.",

        "Abstract":"BACKGROUND: Pegloticase, a PEGylated uricase for uncontrolled gout, rapidly lowers serum urate (SU). Not all patients complete a full-therapy course because anti-pegloticase antibodies can develop, causing efficacy loss and infusion reactions. The literature and clinical trial data indicate that methotrexate co-administration markedly improves pegloticase response rates from the established monotherapy response rate of 42%. Unfortunately, methotrexate use is restricted by kidney disease, which is often present in uncontrolled gout patients. Leflunomide is less restricted in patients with renal dysfunction. This study examined the treatment response rate of pegloticase co-administered with leflunomide.\nMETHODS: Patients co-treated with pegloticase (8 mg biweekly infusion) and oral leflunomide (20 mg\/day) were included. Patient\/treatment characteristics and safety parameters (adverse events [AEs], laboratory parameters) were examined. Pre-infusion prophylaxis was administered (day of infusion: IV solumedrol, night before and morning of infusion: oral fexofenadine or diphenhydramine). Patients were considered treatment responders if ≥ 12 pegloticase infusions were administered and pre-infusion SU < 6 mg\/dl at infusion-12.\nRESULTS: Ten patients (five male, 72.7 ± 12.5 years) were included. The most common comorbidities were chronic kidney disease (90%), hypertension (70%), diabetes mellitus (60%), obesity (60%), and congestive heart failure (50%). Baseline SU was 7.1 ± 2.4 mg\/dl and nine patients (90%) had subcutaneous tophi noted. Seven patients (70%) met responder criteria, receiving 26.6 ± 14.0 infusions (range 13-55) with a pre-infusion-12 SU of 0.9 ± 1.5 mg\/dl. The three non-responders received < 12 infusions because of unrelated AEs or loss of follow-up. Three patients (30%) experienced AEs. One had unrelated cardiac disease worsening and three gout flares, one had a pre-infusion solumedrol reaction (wooziness\/loss of consciousness), and one had two mild, transient increases in liver enzymes.\nCONCLUSIONS: This study supports leflunomide as co-therapy to pegloticase in uncontrolled gout patients. Heterogeneity and high comorbidity burden in uncontrolled gout patients makes having a variety of immunomodulators options important.",

        "Abstract":"['50', '50', '50']\nMany pyrimidine-based xanthine oxidase (XO) inhibitors with diverse chemotypes have been reported recently. Our previous study revealed that 2-(4-alkoxy-3-cyano)phenyl-6-imino-1,6-dihydropyrimidine-5-carboxylic acid derivatives exhibited remarkable XO inhibitory potency. Notably, an intramolecular hydrogen bond (IMHB) formed between amino and carboxylic groups could be observed. With the hope to expand the structure-activity relationships (SARs) and obtain potential pyrimidine-based XO inhibitors, IMHB interruption and scaffold hopping were carried out on these compounds to design 2-(4-alkoxy-3-cyanophenyl)pyrimidine-4\/5-carboxylic acids (11a-11n and 15a-15j) and 6-(4-alkoxy-3-cyanophenyl)-1,2-dihydro-3H-pyrazolo[3,4-d]pyrimidin-3-ones (19a-19j). Among them, compound 19a (IC = 0.039 μM) was identified as the most promising compound with substantially higher in vitro inhibitory potency than allopurinol (IC = 7.590 μM) and comparable to febuxostat (IC = 0.028 μM). The SAR analysis revealed that interrupting the IMHB through the removal of the amino group could damage the XO inhibitory potency; pyrimidine-4-carboxylic acid moiety was more beneficial for the XO inhibitory potency than the pyrimidine-5-carboxylic acid moiety. Additionally, enzyme kinetics studies suggested that compounds 11a, 15a and 19a acted as mixed-type inhibitors for XO and the removal of 6-position amino group resulted in a weakened affinity to the free enzyme, but an enhanced binding to the enzyme-substrate complex. Molecular modeling provided a reasonable explanation for the SARs observed in this study. Furthermore, in vivo hypouricemic effects demonstrated that compounds 15a and 19a could effectively reduce serum uric acid levels at an oral dose of 10 mg\/kg, with 19a demonstrating a stronger effect than 15a. Therefore, our study proved that 6-(4-alkoxy-3-cyanophenyl)-1,2-dihydro-3H-pyrazolo[3,4-d]pyrimidin-3-ones were potent pyrimidine-based XO inhibitors and compound 19a required further structural optimization as a potential and efficacious agents for the treatment of hyperuricemia and gout.",

        "Abstract":"INTRODUCTION We aimed to investigate whether patients with a definite gout diagnosis who were treated in mixed real-life settings (various hospital departments or general practice) followed treatment recommendations. METHODS We included all patients in the hospital's uptake area in 2015-2017 who had been diagnosed with gout after microscopy findings of urate crystals. Data regarding comorbidities and indications for urate-lowering therapy (ULT) were collected. The criteria for treatment success were a p-urate level less-than 6 mg\/dl (less-than 0.36 mmol\/l) or less-than 5 mg\/dl (less-than 0.30 mmol\/l) if tophi were present. All patients were followed up for 24 months. RESULTS The study included 100 patients with a median age of 70 years, and 82% of patients were males. An indication for ULT was present in 99 patients and initiated in 79 patients. Fourteen of these 99 patients died within one year. For the remaining 85 patients, p-urate was measured, and the target was reached by 22 (26%) patients, not reached by 33 (39%) patients and not measured in 30 (35%) patients. Treatment success was positively associated with a written treatment plan in the rheumatology record after microscopy, initiation of ULT in the clinic, provision of a gout leaflet, a higher number of outpatient visits and non-smoking status. CONCLUSIONS Many patients with crystal-proven gout did not receive ULT as recommended. Even if ULT was initiated, the p-urate level was monitored infrequently and the dose of ULT was not escalated when necessary. The best outcomes were associated with continued care in a rheumatology clinic. FUNDING none.

Conversely, they may be at increased risk of cerebrovascular disease. Mendelian randomization (MR) studies use a genetic score as an instrumental variable to address the causality of the association between a risk factor (here, UA or gout) and an outcome. So far, MR analyses do not support a causal relationship of UA or gout with Alzheimer's disease and dementia, and of UA with Parkinson's disease or stroke. Observation studies indicate a U-shaped association between UA and brain diseases, but MR studies do not support that this association is causal. Further studies should address the causal role of gout as well as the impact of urate-lowering therapy on these outcomes.",

        "Abstract":"BACKGROUND: Tumor lysis syndrome (TLS) is an oncologic emergency commonly seen in children with hemato-lymphoid malignancies. Recombinant urate oxidase (RUO) is used in both the prophylaxis and treatment of TLS. However, in resource-constrained countries, its role is mostly limited to the treatment of established TLS and data regarding the use of RUO and its outcome is sparse.\nOBJECTIVE: To describe the outcome of Pediatric TLS following the use of a fixed - dose of RUO.\nMETHODS: A retrospective chart review of all children <15 years of age admitted in the Department of Paediatric Oncology, Kidwai Cancer Institute from April 2017 to July 2018 with TLS and treated with a single, fixed - dose (1.5 mg) RUO was undertaken.\nRESULTS: During the study period, 255 children with hemato-lymphoid malignancies were diagnosed to be at risk of developing TLS. Of these, only 22 (8.6%) children developed TLS and received RUO. Among those with TLS, 15 (68.2%) had Acute Lymphoblastic Leukemia (ALL) while 7 (31.8%) had Non - Hodgkin lymphoma (NHL). 91% (20\/22) children had spontaneous TLS and the remainder developed therapy-related TLS. Median age at presentation was 8 years (IQR 5.25,1.75) with 4.5:1 male: female ratio. The mean urate level at admission was 19.12 mg\/dl (+\/- 8mg\/dl) (Range: 10.7-34.5). 91% (20\/22) children received RUO at less than 0.15 mg\/kg and the median dose of RUO was 0.05 mg\/kg (IQR 0.038-0.08). Of the 22 children with TLS, 2 children failed to achieve normal serum urate levels at 24 hours in response to a single fixed-dose of RUO and hence received an extra dose of RUO. Serum urate levels remarkably declined following RUO administration from 19.12 mg\/dl (+\/-8) to 8.2 mg\/dl (+\/-3.9), 3.99 mg\/dl (+\/-1.6) and 2.84 mg\/dl (+\/-1.3) at 12h, 24h and 48h respectively. AKI was present in 15 (68.2%) children. The median eGFR of the group at diagnosis was 49 ml\/min\/1.73m2 (IQR 26.3, 70). None of the children required hemodialysis. No significant adverse events occurred.\nCONCLUSION: Fixed-dose RUO can achieve rapid, adequate and sustained drop in serum urate levels in Paediatric TLS. It is a useful strategy for managing TLS in resource-constrained settings.",

        "Abstract":"a\nCo-crystallization studies were undertaken to improve the solubility of a highly water-insoluble drug febuxostat (FXT), used in the treatment of gout and hyperuricemia. The selection of co-crystal former (CCF) molecules such as 1-hydroxy 2-naphthoic acid (1H-2NPH), 4-hydroxy benzoic acid (4-HBA), salicylic acid (SAC), 5-nitro isophthalic acid (5-NPH), isonicotinamide (ISNCT), and picolinamide (PICO) was based on the presence of complementary functional groups capable of forming hydrogen bond and the ΔpK difference between FXT and CCF. A liquid-assisted grinding (LAG) method was successfully employed for the rapid screening of various pharmaceutical adducts. These adducts were characterized based on their unique thermal (differential scanning calorimetry) and spectroscopic (Fourier transform infrared and Raman spectroscopy) profiles. Binary phase diagrams (BPD) were plotted to establish a relationship between the thermal events and adduct formed. Powder X-ray diffraction (PXRD) studies were carried out to confirm the formation of eutectic\/co-crystal. Thermogravimetric analysis (TGA) was also performed for the novel co-crystals obtained. The propensity for strong homo-synthons over weak hetero-synthons and strong hetero-synthons over weak homo-synthons during supramolecular growth resulted in the formation of eutectics and co-crystals respectively. FXT:1H-2NPH (1), FXT:4-HBA (1), FXT:SAC (1, 2), and FXT:5-NPH (2-1) gave rise to pure eutectic systems, while FXT:ISNCT (2-1) and FXT:PICO (1) gave rise to novel co-crystals with characteristic DSC heating curves and PXRD pattern. Additionally, the impact of microenvironmental pH and microspeciation profile on the improved dissolution profile of the co-crystals was discussed. Graphical Abstract.",

Rasburicase, a recombinant urate oxidase, is a common treatment for hyperuricemia from different etiologies. There are scarce reports on rasburicase treatment for neonatal Acute Kidney Injury (AKI) with hyperuricemia to prevent renal damage secondary to hyperuricemia. Herein we report a case of neonatal AKI with hyperuricemia that was treated with a single dose of rasburicase. Serum uric acid declined immediately after rasburicase infusion and remained in the normal range since then. In contrast to previous reports, the normalization of uric acid levels was not accompanied by recovery from AKI and serum creatinine levels remained elevated for a long period. The neonate recovered from AKI only 2 weeks post rasburicase treatment. This case report highlights the importance of uric acid levels in neonatal AKI and suggests treatment with rasburicase in cases of hyperuricemia and acute kidney injury in neonates.",

Painful flares and tophaceous deposits are debilitating, reduce quality of life and put strain on health-care systems.\nAREAS COVERED: This review provides an overview of the treatment of gout flares and lowering serum urate. First line agents are discussed with emphasis on emerging evidence. Novel therapies are also covered.\nEXPERT OPINION: Lifestyle modifications form a part of gout prevention. NSAIDs, colchicine, and glucocorticoids are first line agents for gout flares. The IL-1β antagonists are highly effective for arresting flares but their cost-effectiveness render them salvage therapies. Allopurinol is an agent of first choice for urate lowering therapy. In Southeast Asian and Black populations, screening for HLA*B58:01 mutation is a cost-effective approach to decrease the occurrence of allopurinol hypersensitivity syndrome. Febuxostat is another efficacious urate lowering therapy, but has received a U.S. FDA black box warning for cardiovascular safety. Novel uricosurics are a class for continued drug development; verinurad and arhalofenate are agents with future promise. For patients with recalcitrant gout, pegloticase is effective. Its immunogenicity significantly threatens the achievement of sustained urate lowering responses. Abrogating pegloticase's immunogenicity with immunomodulatory co-therapy may lend to sustained efficacy.",

        "Published":"2022-04-11",
        "Abstract":"OBJECTIVE: To determine whether a therapeutic approach of intensive serum urate lowering results in improved bone erosion scores in patients with erosive gout.\nMETHODS: We undertook a 2-year, double-blind randomized controlled trial of 104 participants with erosive gout who were receiving serum urate-lowering therapy orally and who had serum urate levels of ≥0.30 mmoles\/liter at baseline. Participants were randomly assigned to either an intensive serum urate target of <0.20 mmoles\/liter or a standard target of <0.30 mmoles\/liter (considered the standard according to rheumatology guidelines). Oral serum urate-lowering therapy was titrated to target using a standardized protocol (with the maximum approved doses of allopurinol, probenecid, febuxostat, and benzbromarone). The primary end point was the total computed tomography (CT) bone erosion score. Outcome Measures in Rheumatology (OMERACT) gout core outcome domains were secondary end points.\nRESULTS: Although the serum urate levels were significantly lower in the intensive target group compared to the standard target group over the study period (P = 0.002), fewer participants in the intensive target group achieved the randomized serum urate target level by year 2 (62% versus 83% of patients in the standard target group; P < 0.05). The intensive target group required higher doses of allopurinol (mean ± SD 746 ± 210 mg\/day versus 497 ± 186 mg\/day; P < 0.001) and received more combination therapy (P = 0.0004) compared to the standard target group. We observed small increases in CT bone erosion scores in both serum urate target groups over 2 years, with no between-group difference (P = 0.20). OMERACT core outcome domains (gout flares, tophi, pain, patient's global assessment of disease activity, health-related quality of life, and activity limitation) improved in both groups over 2 years, with no between-group differences. Adverse event and serious adverse event rates were similar between the groups.\nCONCLUSION: Compared to a serum urate target of <0.30 mmoles\/liter, more intensive serum urate lowering is difficult to achieve with an oral urate-lowering therapy. Intensive serum urate lowering leads to a high medication burden and does not improve bone erosion scores in patients with erosive gout.",

        "Abstract":"BACKGROUND: Our previous research showed that uric acid lowering therapy (ULT) for gout and hyperuricemia is being prescribed for pediatric patients even though these drugs have not been approved for use in children. However, the actual clinical situation has not been clearly elucidated. In this paper, we provide an in-depth look at the details of actual clinical practice.\nMETHODS: This retrospective cross-sectional study accessed health insurance data for 696,277 children from April 2016 through March 2017 to identify pediatric patients with gout or asymptomatic hyperuricemia, calculate the proportion of patients prescribed ULTs, and analyze population characteristics. Adherence and mean dose for febuxostat and allopurinol, the most commonly prescribed drugs, were also analyzed.\nRESULTS: Among children with gout or asymptomatic hyperuricemia, we found that 35.1% (97\/276) were prescribed ULT. This proportion increased with age, especially among males. By comorbidity, ULT was prescribed to 47.9% (46\/96) of patients with kidney disease, 41.3% (26\/63) for cardiovascular disease, 40.0% (6\/15) for Down syndrome, and 27.1% (32\/118) for metabolic syndrome. In patients with kidney disease, febuxostat was prescribed more than twice as frequently as allopurinol (28 vs. 12). Median values for the medication possession ratio (MPR) of febuxostat and allopurinol were 70.1 and 76.7%, respectively, and prescriptions were continued for a relatively long period for both drugs. Both drugs were prescribed at about half the adult dose for patients 6-11 years old and about the same as the adult dose for patients 12-18 years old.\nCONCLUSIONS: This study showed that the continuous management of serum uric acid is being explored using off-label use of ULT in pediatric patients with gout or asymptomatic hyperuricemia in Japan. Drug selection is based on patient characteristics such as sex, age, and comorbidities, and pediatric dosage is based on usage experience in adults. To develop appropriate pediatric ULT, clinical trials are needed on the efficacy and safety of ULT in the pediatric population.\nTRIAL REGISTRATION: UMIN000036029 .",

        "Abstract":"Gout is a common hyperuricaemic metabolic condition that leads to painful inflammatory arthritis and a high comorbidity burden, especially cardiometabolic-renal (CMR) conditions, including hypertension, myocardial infarction, stroke, obesity, hyperlipidaemia, type 2 diabetes mellitus and chronic kidney disease. Substantial advances have been made in our understanding of the excess CMR burden in gout, ranging from pathogenesis underlying excess CMR comorbidities, inferring causal relationships from Mendelian randomization studies, and potentially discovering urate crystals in coronary arteries using advanced imaging, to clinical trials and observational studies. Despite many studies finding an independent association between blood urate levels and risk of incident CMR events, Mendelian randomization studies have largely found that serum urate is not causal for CMR end points or intermediate risk factors or outcomes (such as kidney function, adiposity, metabolic syndrome, glycaemic traits or blood lipid concentrations). Although limited, randomized controlled trials to date in adults without gout support this conclusion. If imaging studies suggesting that monosodium urate crystals are deposited in coronary plaques in patients with gout are confirmed, it is possible that these crystals might have a role in the inflammatory pathogenesis of increased cardiovascular risk in patients with gout; removing monosodium urate crystals or blocking the inflammatory pathway could reduce this excess risk. Accordingly, data for CMR outcomes with these urate-lowering or anti-inflammatory therapies in patients with gout are needed. In the meantime, highly pleiotropic CMR and urate-lowering benefits of sodium-glucose cotransporter 2 (SGLT2) inhibitors and key lifestyle measures could play an important role in comorbidity care, in conjunction with effective gout care based on target serum urate concentrations according to the latest guidelines.",

The novel anti-hyperuricemic drug febuxostat is a potent non-purine selective xanthine oxidase inhibitor. The present study examined the UA-lowering and prognostic effects of febuxostat in patients with HF compared with conventional allopurinol.\nMETHODS: This multicenter, randomized trial included 263 patients with chronic HF who were randomly assigned to two groups and received allopurinol or febuxostat (UA >7.0 mg\/dL). All patients were followed up for 3 years after enrollment.\nRESULTS: There were no significant differences in baseline clinical characteristics between the two groups. The UA level was significantly decreased after 3 years of drug administration compared with the baseline in both groups. Urine levels of the oxidative stress marker 8-hydroxy-2'-deoxyguanosine were lower in the febuxostat group than in the allopurinol group (11.0 ± 9.6 vs. 22.9 ± 15.9 ng\/mL), and the rate of patients free from hospitalization due to worsening HF tended to be higher in the febuxostat group than in the allopurinol group (89.0% vs. 83.0%).\nCONCLUSIONS: Febuxostat is potentially more effective than allopurinol for treating patients with chronic HF and hyperuricemia.This study was registered in the University Hospital Medical Information Network Clinical Trials Registry (https:\/\/www.umin.ac.jp\/ctr\/; ID: 000009817).",

A consensus statement by the Gout, Hyperuricemia and Crystal-Associated Disease Network outlined appropriate terminology regarding gout, which will aid in communication about various aspects of the disease. The 2020 American College of Rheumatology gout guideline offers comprehensive evidence-based recommendations for the management of hyperuricemia using urate-lowering therapy, prophylaxis when initiating urate-lowering therapy, treatment of gout flare and adjunctive management strategies. There is improved understanding of risk factors for allopurinol hypersensitivity syndrome and well tolerated use of allopurinol in chronic kidney disease. Trial data have provided new insights regarding cardiovascular risk with febuxostat.

The effects of chronic hyperuricemia on trained immunity, and the hyperinflammatory state induced by gout itself may also play a role. Frequent courses of glucocorticoids for gout flares may be associated with adverse outcomes after COVID-19 infection and reduced immunogenicity to the COVID-19 vaccination.

AA veterans with gout who met the 1977 Preliminary American College of Rheumatology (ACR) classification criteria for gout, currently prescribed an oral ULT medication (allopurinol or febuxostat) for at least 6 months, and not using a pillbox to redistribute their medications, will be invited to an in-person study visit. After the study coordinators obtain informed consent, and ensure that participants meet the inclusion criteria, the eligible participants will be provided with their current ULT in a MEMSCap™ bottle for the 1-month run-in period and asked to return to the clinic in 1 month. ULT adherence with MEMSCap™ will be recorded at a 1-month return visit. Interested participants will complete the baseline assessments, randomized using the computerized system to either gout-storytelling intervention or a stress reduction intervention video arm and watch the respective video in-clinic. Patients will be interviewed on the phone at 2 and 4 months regarding the viewing of the videos at home at each time. Participants will be assessed in-clinic at 3, 6, 9, and 12 months; MEMSCap™ data and patient surveys will be captured at each visit. For any missed visit, assessments will be completed on the phone and MEMSCap™ data captured at the next in-clinic visit.\nDISCUSSION: The study will assess the efficacy of a behavioral intervention to improve ULT adherence in minority populations with gout.\nTRIAL REGISTRATION: ClinicalTrials.gov NCT02741700.

        "Abstract":"['14', '14']\nC\nmax\nHR011303, a promising selective urate transporter 1 inhibitor, is currently being studied in a phase III clinical trial in China for the treatment of hyperuricemia and gout. In the current study, the pharmacokinetics, mass balance, and metabolism of HR011303 were examined in six healthy Chinese male subjects who received a single oral dose of 10 mg of [C]HR011303 (80 µCi). The results showed that HR011303 was rapidly absorbed with a median time to reach   of 1.50 hours postdose, and the arithmetic mean half-life of total radioactivity was approximately 24.2 hours in plasma. The mean blood-to-plasma radioactivity concentration ratio was 0.66, suggesting the preferential distribution of drug-related components in plasma. At 216 hours postdose, the mean cumulative excreted radioactivity was 91.75% of the dose, including 81.50% in urine and 10.26% in feces. Six metabolites were identified, and the parent drug HR011303 was the most abundant component in plasma and feces, but a minor component in urine. Glucuronidation of the carboxylic acid moiety of HR011303 was the primary metabolic pathway in humans, amounting to 69.63% of the dose (M5, 51.57% of the dose; M5\/2, 18.06% of the dose) in the urine; however, it was not detected in plasma. UDP-glucuronosyltransferase (UGT) 2B7 was responsible for the formation of M5. Overall, after a single oral dose of 10 mg of [C]HR011303 (80 µCi), HR011303 and its main metabolites were eliminated via renal excretion. The major metabolic pathway was carboxylic acid glucuronidation, which was catalyzed predominantly by UGT2B7. SIGNIFICANCE STATEMENT: This study determined the absorption and disposition of HR011303, a selective urate transporter (URAT) 1 inhibitor currently in development for the treatment of hyperuricemia and gout. This work helps to characterize the major metabolic pathways of new URAT inhibitors and identify the absorption and clearance mechanism.",

        "Abstract":"AIMS: To compare the effectiveness of allopurinol with no treatment or placebo for the prevention of cardiovascular events in hyperuricemic patients.\nMETHODS AND RESULTS: Pubmed, Web of Science and Cochrane library were searched from inception until July 2020. Randomized controlled trials (RCT) and observational studies in hyperuricemic patients without significant renal disease and treated with allopurinol, versus placebo or no treatment were included. Outcome measures were cardiovascular mortality, myocardial infarction, stroke, or a combined endpoint (CM\/MI\/S). For RCT's a random effects meta-analysis was performed. For observational studies a narrative synthesis was performed. Of the original 1995 references we ultimately included 26 RCT's and 21 observational studies. We found a significantly reduced risk of combined endpoint (Risk Ratio 0.65 [95% CI] [0.46 to 0.91]; p = 0.012) and myocardial infarction (RR 0.47 [0.27 to 0.80]; p = 0.01) in the allopurinol group compared to controls. We found no significant effect of allopurinol on stroke or cardiovascular mortality. Of the 15 observational studies with sufficient quality, allopurinol was associated with reduced cardiovascular mortality in 1 out of 3 studies that reported this outcome, myocardial infarction in 6 out of 8, stroke in 4 out of 7, and combined end-point in 2 out of 2. Cardiovascular benefit was only observed when allopurinol therapy was prolonged for more than 6 months and when an appropriate allopurinol dose was administered (300 mg or more\/day) or sufficient reduction of serum urate concentration was achieved (<0.36 mmol\/l).\nCONCLUSIONS: Data from RCT's and observational studies indicate that allopurinol treatment reduces cardiovascular risk in patients with hyperuricemia. However, the quality of evidence from RCTs is low to moderate. To establish whether allopurinol lowers the risk of cardiovascular events a well-designed and adequately powered randomized, placebo-controlled trial is needed in high-risk patients with hyperuricemia.\nSYSTEMATIC REVIEW REGISTRATION: PROSPERO registration CRD42018089744.",

Liver organoids can be generated from single hepatocytes and passaged for several months, retaining key morphological features, functional purine metabolism and global gene expression profile. Furthermore, organoids can be differentiated into hepatocytes with high expression of maturation markers including the hepatocyte nuclear factor-4-alpha (HNF4α), E-cadherin (E-Ca), and albumin (ALB). Importantly, organoids can produce high level of uric acid after xanthine induction which is the substrate of xanthine oxidase. Furthermore, the preclinical application potential of this organoid model was verified by measuring the antihyperuricemic effect of the widely used allopurinol, as well as the reported bioactive substance puerarin.

        "Abstract":"INTRODUCTION: Gout is the most common inflammatory arthritis, but was not considered in most COVID-19 and rheumatic diseases reports. Our aim was to describe changes in clinical data, treatment, function and quality of life for gout patients during COVID-19 pandemic.\nMETHODS: Prospective, descriptive and analytical study of 101 consecutive gout (ACR\/EULAR 2015) patients from our clinic evaluated during pandemic by phone call (n=52) or phone call + face-to-face (n=68) that accepted to participate. Variables are demographics, clinical and treatment data, HAQ, EQ5D questionnaires and COVID-19-related data. Patients were divided in two groups: flare (n=36) or intercritical gout (n=65) also; available pre-pandemic data was obtained from 71 patients. Statistical analyses are X, paired t-test and Wilcoxon test.\nRESULTS: Included gout patients were males (95.8%), mean (SD) age 54.7 (10.7) years and disease duration 16.4 (9.8) years; 90% received allopurinol, 50% colchicine as prophylaxis and 25% suspended ≥ 1 medication. Comparison of pre-pandemic vs pandemic data showed > flares (4.4% vs 36%, p=0.01), more flares in the last 6 months: 0.31 (0.75) vs 1.71 (3.1), (p=0.004 and > urate levels: 5.6 (1.7)vs 6.7 (2.2) mg\/dL, p=0.016. Unexpectedly, function and quality-of-life scores improved: HAQ score 0.65 (2.16) vs 0.12 (0.17), p= 0.001. Seven patients were COVID-19-confirmed cases; they had significantly more flares, higher urate levels and lower allopurinol doses and two died.\nCONCLUSIONS: In gout patients, flares were 9 times more frequent during pandemic also, they had increased urate levels but led to an unexpected improvement in HAQ and functionality scores. Resilience and lifestyle changes in gout during COVID-19 pandemic require further studies. Key Points • COVID-19 pandemic is associated with 4 times more flares in gout patients. • Increased flares were also seen in previously well-controlled gout patients. • Increased serum urate levels were also found in gout patients during pandemic. • In our gout clinic, 8\/101 patients were diagnosed as COVID-19+, and two of them died.",

        "Abstract":"Xanthine oxidoreductase (XOR) is a critical, rate-limiting enzyme that controls the last two steps of purine catabolism by converting hypoxanthine to xanthine and xanthine to uric acid. It also produces reactive oxygen species (ROS) during the catalytic process. The enzyme is generally recognized as a drug target for the therapy of gout and hyperuricemia. The catalytic products uric acid and ROS act as antioxidants or oxidants, respectively, and are involved in pro\/anti-inflammatory actions, which are associated with various disease manifestations, including metabolic syndrome, ischemia reperfusion injury, cardiovascular disorders, and cancer. Recently, extensive efforts have been devoted to understanding the paradoxical roles of XOR in tumor promotion. Here, we summarize the expression of XOR in different types of cancer and decipher the dual roles of XOR in cancer by its enzymatic or nonenzymatic activity to provide an updated understanding of the mechanistic function of XOR in cancer. We also discuss the potential to modulate XOR in cancer therapy.",

        "Abstract":"['2', '2']\nRheumatoid arthritis (RA) is a common autoimmune disease in the elderly and it has been recently reported to be significantly associated with the activation of mast cells in joint tissues. IL-17A is a vital mediator that stimulates the activation of inflammation. Allopurinol is a classic agent for the suppression of uric acid production, recently reported to exert therapeutic effects on RA. In the present study, we investigated the regulatory effect of allopurinol against IL-17A-induced inflammatory response in mast cells and explored the potential mechanism of allopurinol on RA treatment. Firstly, we found that compared to normal synovium, IL-17A was significantly upregulated in the human RA synovium. IL-17A was used to stimulate an inflammatory state in mast cells in the absence or presence of allopurinol. We found that the production of inflammatory factors, PGE, and COX-2 was significantly elevated in IL-17A-treated mast cells, accompanied by the activation of the iNOS\/NO axis and the elevated secretion of ROS. After treatment with allopurinol, the elevated inflammation, activated COX-2\/PGE and iNOS\/NO axis, and oxidative stress were all dramatically alleviated. Mechanistically, the activated JNK\/AP-1 and NF-κB pathways in IL-17A-treated mast cells were dramatically suppressed by the introduction of allopurinol. Taken together, our data reveal that allopurinol significantly alleviated the IL-17A-induced inflammatory response in mast cells.",

The primary outcome was LOS. Association between 20 variables and the LOS was explored using two generalized linear models. Directed acyclic graph (DAG) was constructed to evaluate the causal relationship between pre-admission urate lowering therapy (ULT) and LOS.\nRESULTS: The cohort included 36 047 admissions. We identified five variables associated with shorter LOS (pre-admission regular urate-lowering therapy (ULT), serum urate testing, male gender, Māori ethnicity and low-dose aspirin) and seven variables associated with longer LOS (M3 multimorbidity index, acute admission, operation, loop diuretics, potassium-sparing diuretics, NSAIDs, and age). Regular ULT had the strongest impact on shorter LOS (10% shorter). The model estimated an additional four days of hospitalization if the patient had multiple variables associated with longer LOS. DAG suggested a causal relationship between regular ULT and LOS under the condition that all unobserved confounders affected only ULT use, with no impact on in-hospital gout flares and\/or LOS except through its influence on ULT use or as mediator of confounders that were observed.\nCONCLUSION: We have identified a set of gout flare-related variables found to be associated with LOS in hospitalized people with comorbid gout.

        "Abstract":"BACKGROUND: Dietary supplements are frequently used for the treatment of several medical conditions, both prescribed by physicians or self administered. However, evidence of benefit and safety of these supplements is usually limited or absent.\nOBJECTIVES: To assess the efficacy and safety of dietary supplementation for people with chronic gout.\nSEARCH METHODS: We updated the original search by searching CENTRAL, MEDLINE, Embase, CINAHL, and four trials registers (August 2020). We applied no date or language restrictions. We also handsearched the abstracts from the 2010 to 2019 American College of Rheumatology and European League against Rheumatism conferences, and checked the references of all included studies.\nSELECTION CRITERIA: We considered all published randomised controlled trials (RCTs) or quasi-RCTs that compared dietary supplements with no supplements, placebo, another supplement, or pharmacological agents for adults with chronic gout for inclusion. Dietary supplements included, but were not limited to, amino acids, antioxidants, essential minerals, polyunsaturated fatty acids, prebiotic agents, probiotic agents, and vitamins. The major outcomes were acute gout flares, study withdrawal due to adverse events (AEs), serum uric acid (sUA) reduction, joint pain reduction, participant global assessment, total number of AEs, and tophus regression.\nDATA COLLECTION AND ANALYSIS: We used standard methodological procedures expected by Cochrane.\nMAIN RESULTS: Two previously included RCTs (160 participants) met our inclusion criteria; we did not identify any new trials for this update. As these two trials evaluated different diet supplements (enriched skim milk powder (SMP) and vitamin C) with different outcomes (gout flare prevention for enriched SMP, and sUA reduction for vitamin C), we reported the results separately. One trial (120 participants), at unclear risk of selection and detection bias, compared SMP enriched with glycomacropeptides (GMP) with un-enriched SMP, and with lactose, over three months. Participants were predominantly men, aged in their 50s, who had severe gout. The results for all major outcomes were imprecise, except for pain. None of the results were clinically significant. The frequency of acute gout attacks, measured as the number of flares per month, decreased in all three groups over the three-month study period. The effects of enriched SMP (SMP\/GMP\/G600) compared with the combined control groups (SMP and lactose powder) at three months in terms of mean number of gout flares per month were not clinically significant (mean (standard deviation (SD)) flares per month: 0.49 (1.52) in SMP\/GMP\/G60 group versus 0.70 (1.28) in the control groups; absolute risk difference: mean difference (MD) -0.21 flares per month, 95% confidence interval (CI) -0.76 to 0.34; low-quality evidence). The number of withdrawals due to adverse effects was similar between groups (7\/40 in SMP\/GMP\/G600 group versus 11\/80 in control groups; (risk ratio (RR) 1.27, 95% CI 0.53 to 3.03); there were 4% more withdrawals in the SMP\/lactose groups (10% fewer to 18% more; low-quality evidence). Serum uric acid reduction was similar across groups (mean (SD) -0.025 (0.067) mmol\/L in SMP\/GMP\/G60 group versus -0.010 (0.069) in control groups; MD -0.01, 95% CI -0.04 to 0.01; low-quality evidence). Pain from self-reported gout flares (measured on a 10-point Likert scale) improved slightly more in the GMP\/G600 SMP group compared with controls (mean (SD) -1.97 (2.28) in SMP\/GMP\/G600 group versus -0.94 (2.25) in control groups; MD -1.03, 95% CI -1.89 to -0.17). This was an absolute reduction of 10% (95% CI 20% to 1% reduction; low-quality evidence), which may not be of clinical relevance. The risk of adverse events was similar between groups (19\/40 in SMP\/GMP\/G600 group versus 39\/80 in control groups; RR 0.97, 95% CI 0.66 to 1.45); the absolute risk difference was 1% fewer adverse events (1% fewer to 2% more), low-quality evidence). Gastrointestinal events such as nausea, flatulence and diarrhoea were the most commonly reported adverse effects. Data for participant global assessment were not available for analysis; the study did not report tophus regression. One trial (40 participants), at high risk of selection, performance, and detection bias, compared vitamin C alone with allopurinol, and with allopurinol plus vitamin C, in a three-arm study. We only included data from the vitamin C versus allopurinol comparison in this review. Participants were predominantly middle-aged men, and their severity of gout was representative of gout in general. Allopurinol reduced sUA levels more than vitamin C (MD 0.10 mmol\/L, 95% CI 0.06 to 0.15), low-quality evidence. The study reported no adverse events; none of the participants withdrew due to adverse events. The study did not assess the rate of gout attacks, joint pain reduction, participant global assessment, or tophus regression.\nAUTHORS' CONCLUSIONS: While dietary supplements may be widely used for gout, this review found no high-quality that supported or refuted the use of glycomacropeptide-enriched skim milk powder or vitamin C for adults with chronic gout.",

In recent years, several new medications to treat gout have been developed, and novel agents continue to be investigated, in addition to several long-established treatments. Although a number of effective therapies are available, optimal management and outcomes are frequently not achieved due to physician under prescribing of urate-lowering therapy (ULT) and poor adherence with therapy when it is prescribed.

        "Abstract":"BACKGROUND: Urate-lowering therapy (ULT) adherence is low in gout, and few, if any, effective, low-cost, interventions are available. Our objective was to assess if a culturally appropriate gout-storytelling intervention is superior to an attention control for improving gout outcomes in African-Americans (AAs).\nMETHODS: In a 1-year, multicenter, randomized controlled trial, AA veterans with gout were randomized to gout-storytelling intervention vs. a stress reduction video (attention control group; 1:1 ratio). The primary outcome was ULT adherence measured with MEMSCap™, an electronic monitoring system that objectively measured ULT medication adherence.\nRESULTS: The 306 male AA veterans with gout who met the eligibility criteria were randomized to the gout-storytelling intervention (n = 152) or stress reduction video (n = 154); 261\/306 (85%) completed the 1-year study. The mean age was 64 years, body mass index was 33 kg\/m, and gout disease duration was 3 years. ULT adherence was similar in the intervention vs. control groups: 3 months, 73% versus 70%; 6 months, 69% versus 69%; 9 months, 66% versus 67%; and 12 months, 61% versus 64% (p > 0.05 each). Secondary outcomes (gout flares, serum urate and gout-specific health-related quality of life [HRQOL]) in the intervention versus control groups were similar at all time points except intervention group outcomes were better for the following: (1) number of gout flares at 9 months were fewer, 0.7 versus 1.3 in the previous month (p = 0.03); (2) lower\/better scores on two gout specific HRQOL subscales: gout medication side effects at 3 months, 32.8 vs. 39.6 (p = 0.02); and unmet gout treatment need at 3 months, 30.9 vs. 38.2 (p = 0.003), and 6 months, 29.5 vs. 34.5 (p = 0.03), respectively.\nCONCLUSIONS: A culturally appropriate gout-storytelling intervention was not superior to attention control for improving gout outcomes in AAs with gout.\nTRIAL REGISTRATION: Registered at ClinicalTrials.gov NCT02741700.",

The aim of this pilot study was to investigate the effects of allopurinol on pain and anxiety in women displaying fibromyalgia refractory to conventional therapy. This prospective case series enrolled 12 women with previous diagnosis of fibromyalgia refractory to conventional therapy. Patients received an add-on therapy with oral allopurinol 300mg twice daily for 30 days. Patients were submitted to evaluation for pain and anxiety scores before treatment, 15 and 30 days thereafter. This pilot study has demonstrated that oral administration of allopurinol 300mg twice daily caused a significant reduction on pain scores up to 30 days of treatment in women with fibromyalgia. No effect was observed regarding anxiety scores. Randomized clinical trials are warranted and should further investigate allopurinol and more selective purine derivatives in the management of acute or chronic pain conditions.",

        "Abstract":"['in vitro', 'in vivo']\nUric acid is the final product of purine metabolism, and excessive serum uric acid can cause gouty arthritis and uric acid nephropathy. Therefore, lowering the uric acid level and alleviating inflammation in the body are the key points to treating these diseases. A stable nanosuspension of peptide BmK9 was prepared by the precipitation-ultrasonication method. By combining uricase on the surface of a positively charged carrier, a complex consisting of neutral rod-shaped BmK9 and uricase nanoparticles (Nplex) was formed to achieve the delivery of BmK9 and uricase, respectively. The formulation of Nplex has a diameter of 180 nm and drug loading up to 200%, which releases BmK9 and uricase slowly and steadily in drug release tests . There was significantly improved pharmacokinetic behavior of the two drugs because Nplex prolonged the half-life and increased tissue accumulation. Histological assessments showed that the dual drug Nplex can reduce the inflammation response in acute gouty arthritis and chronic uric acid nephropathy . In the macrophage system, there was lower toxicity and increased beneficial effect on inflammation with Nplex than free BmK9 or uricase. Collectively, this novel formulation provides a dual drug delivery system that can treat gouty arthritis and uric acid nephropathy.",

        "Abstract":"BACKGROUND\/PURPOSE: Disordered osteoclast activity has been implicated in the pathogenesis of gouty bone erosion. We sought to determine if the addition of denosumab (a monoclonal antibody targeting the receptor activator of nuclear factor kappa-B ligand - RANKL) to intensive urate-lowering therapy (ULT) improves gouty bone erosion.\nMETHODS: Open-label, parallel-group pilot randomized controlled trial in which 20 participants with gout with at least one confirmed conventional radiographic foot bone erosion were assigned in a 1:1 allocation to receive denosumab (60 mg subcutaneous every 6 months) added to intensive ULT (serum urate ≤5 mg\/dL or 300 µmol\/L at the time of randomization and continued for the duration of the study), or intensive ULT alone. The primary outcome was the change in the bilateral foot and ankle computed tomography (CT) bone erosion score from baseline to 12 months, assessed by an experienced musculoskeletal radiologist blinded to study assignment. Secondary outcomes included change in serum C-terminal telopeptide (CTX), and patient reported outcomes of pain and function.\nRESULTS: Although serum CTX declined markedly in the denosumab\/ULT group compared with the ULT alone group, there was no interval change in CT erosion score in either the denosumab\/ULT or ULT alone group after one year of follow-up. Other secondary outcomes did not differ between groups. There were two severe adverse events: One patient developed atrial fibrillation (on denosumab\/ULT) and another atrial flutter (on ULT alone).\nCONCLUSIONS: In this pilot study, denosumab did not offer additional benefit to intensive urate lowering therapy for gouty bone erosion.",

        "Abstract":"BACKGROUND: The prevalence of renal calculi in patients with gout is high. Alkalized urine has been recommended by the 2020 European Association of Urology (EAU) guidelines to promote calculus dissolution. However, randomized controlled trials are lacking.\nMETHODS: In the protocol of this randomized, placebo-controlled, double-blinded trial, patients with gout combined with renal calculi are randomized (1:1) to the placebo and sodium bicarbonate groups. The intervention would be performed for 24 weeks, the 1-12 weeks are double-blinded, and the 13-24 weeks are open-labeled. Sodium bicarbonate (1 g tid) will be performed for 24 weeks in the sodium bicarbonate group. The placebo will be performed for 12 weeks and not be performed from 13 weeks to 24 weeks in the placebo group. All subjects will be administered febuxostat (40 mg\/day) for 24 weeks and receive concomitant anti-inflammatory prophylaxis therapy for 12 weeks. The primary outcome is the proportion of patients whose renal calculus volume will be reduced after 12 weeks of treatment. The secondary outcomes include the volume changes of renal calculi, uric acid changes, the proportion of patients with serum uric acid (sUA) levels < 360 μmol\/L, the changes in estimated glomerular filtration rate (eGFR), the pH value of urine, and the incidence of adverse events after treatment for 12 and 24 weeks.\nDISCUSSION: This study will evaluate the efficacy and safety of sodium bicarbonate-alkalized urine on renal calculi in patients with gout.\nTRIAL REGISTRATION: ClinicalTrials.gov ChiCTR2100045183.

        "Abstract":"['2', '2', '2', '2', '2', '2', '2', '2']\nNanozyme-based cascade reaction has emerged as an effective strategy for disease treatment because of its high efficiency and low side effects. Herein, a new and highly active two-dimensional Pd-Ru nanozyme is prepared and then integrated with uricase and red blood cell (RBC) membrane to fabricate a tandem nanoreactor, Pd-Ru\/Uricase@RBC, for hyperuricemia treatment. The designed Pd-Ru\/Uricase@RBC nanoreactor displayed not only good stability against extreme pH, temperature and proteolytic degradation, but also long circulation half-life and excellent safety. The nanoreactor can effectively degrade UA by uricase to allantoin and H O and remove H O by using Pd-Ru nanosheets (NSs) with the catalase (CAT)-like activity. More importantly, the finally produced O from H O decomposition can in turn facilitate the catalytic oxidation of UA, as the degradation of UA is an O consumption process. By integrating the high-efficiency enzymatic activity, long circulation capability, and good biocompatibility, the designed Pd-Ru\/Uricase@RBC can effectively and safely treat hyperuricemia without side effects. The study affords a new alternative for the exploration of clinical treatment of hyperuricemia.",

We conducted a retrospective cohort study to examine the 2000-2015 national dataset containing all claims data of 23 million beneficiaries in Taiwan. Subjects who already had diabetes mellitus, gout-related diseases, and any cancer prior to the index date were excluded. Asymptomatic hyperuricemia was defined as subjects taking urate-lowering drugs who never had a gout flare. Subjects aged 20-84 with asymptomatic hyperuricemia who had benzbromarone prescriptions were selected as the benzbromarone group. Sex-matched and age-matched subjects with asymptomatic hyperuricemia who had allopurinol prescriptions were identified as the allopurinol group. The maximum follow-up duration was set as 5 years in our study. The outcome was set as subjects who had a new diagnosis of T2DM. The incidence density of T2DM was calculated in the benzbromarone and allopurinol groups. The hazard ratio (HR) and 95% confidence interval (CI) for T2DM was utilized to estimate the association between medications and the risk of T2DM.  The incidence of T2DM among benzbromarone users was significantly lower than that of allopurinol users (7.91 versus 8.48 per 100 person-years, incidence rate ratio = 0.93, and 95% CI = 0.87-0.99). After adjustment for co-variables, the adjusted HR of T2DM would be 0.91 (95% CI = 0.85-0.98 and  = 0.008) in benzbromarone users as compared to allopurinol users.  There is a small but statistically significant risk reduction of developing T2DM in people with asymptomatic hyperuricemia taking benzbromarone as compared to those taking allopurinol during 5 years of follow-up. It indicates a future research direction for the use of individual urate-lowering drugs on the prevention of T2DM in the general population.",

We evaluated the effect of febuxostat on echocardiographic parameters of diastolic function in patients with asymptomatic hyperuricemia as a prespecified endpoint in the subanalysis of the PRIZE study. Patients in the PRIZE study were assigned randomly to either add-on febuxostat treatment group or control group with only appropriate lifestyle modification. Of the 514 patients in the overall study, 65 patients (31 in the febuxostat group and 34 in the control group) who had complete follow-up echocardiographic data of the ratio of peak early diastolic transmitral flow velocity (E) to peak early diastolic mitral annular velocity (e') at baseline and after 12 and 24 months were included.

Interestingly, e' was slightly decreased in the control group compared with in the febuxostat group (treatment p = 0.068, time, p = 0.337, treatment × Time, p = 0.217). As a result, there were significant increases in E\/e' (treatment p = 0.045, time, p = 0.177, treatment × time, p = 0.137) after 24 months in the control group compared with the febuxostat group. There was no significant difference in the serum levels of N-terminal-pro brain natriuretic peptide and high-sensitive troponin I between the two groups during the study period.

        "Published":"2021-10-12",
        "Abstract":"INTRODUCTION: Several previous studies have suggested that uric acid-lowering therapy (ULT) can slow the progression of chronic kidney disease (CKD). Although crucial for CKD patients, few studies have evaluated the effects of different ULT medications on kidney function. This systematic review summarizes evidence from randomized controlled trials (RCTs) regarding the effects of ULT on kidney function.\nMETHOD: We performed a systematic search of PubMed, MEDLINE, Embase, Scopus, and the Cochrane Library up to September 2021 to identify RCTs in CKD patients comparing the effects of ULT on kidney function with other ULT medications or placebo. A network meta-analysis was performed to compare each ULT indirectly. The primary outcome was a change in estimated glomerular filtration rate (eGFR) from baseline.\nRESULTS: Ten studies were selected with a total of 1480 patients. Topiroxostat significantly improved eGFR and reduced the urinary albumin\/creatinine ratio compared to placebo (mean difference (MD) and 95% confidence interval [95% CI]: 1.49 [0.08; 2.90], P = 0.038 and 25.65% [13.25; 38.04], P < 0.001, respectively). Although febuxostat did not show a positive effect overall, it significantly improved renal function (i.e., eGFR) in a subgroup of CKD patients with hyperuricemia (MD [95% CI]: 0.85 [0.02; 1.67], P = 0.045). Allopurinol and pegloticase did not show beneficial effects.\nCONCLUSIONS: Topiroxostat and febuxostat may have better renoprotective effects in CKD patients than other ULT medications. Further large-scale, long-term studies are required to determine whether these effects will lead, ultimately, to reductions in dialysis induction and major adverse cardiovascular events. Key Points • This study is the first network meta-analysis comparing the nephroprotective effects of ULT in CKD patients. • Topiroxostat and febuxostat showed better renoprotective effects in CKD patients than other ULT medications. • Heterogeneity was low in this study, suggesting consistency of results.",

Currently, a double-blind, placebo-controlled study (ALBINO, NCT03162653) is investigating the neuroprotective effect of allopurinol in HIE neonates.\nOBJECTIVE: The aim of the current study was to establish the pharmacokinetics (PK) of allopurinol and oxypurinol, and the pharmacodynamics (PD) of both compounds on hypoxanthine, xanthine, and uric acid in HIE neonates. The dosage used and the effect of allopurinol in this population, either or not undergoing therapeutic hypothermia (TH), were evaluated.\nMETHODS: Forty-six neonates from the ALBINO study and two historical clinical studies were included. All doses were administered on the first day of life. In the ALBINO study (n = 20), neonates received a first dose of allopurinol 20 mg\/kg, and, in the case of TH (n = 13), a second dose of allopurinol 10 mg\/kg. In the historical cohorts (n = 26), neonates (all without TH) received two doses of allopurinol 20 mg\/kg in total. Allopurinol and oxypurinol population PK, and their effects on inhibiting conversions of hypoxanthine and xanthine to uric acid, were assessed using nonlinear mixed-effects modelling.\nRESULTS: Allopurinol and oxypurinol PK were described by two sequential one-compartment models with an autoinhibition effect on allopurinol metabolism by oxypurinol. For allopurinol, clearance (CL) was 0.83 L\/h (95% confidence interval [CI] 0.62-1.09) and volume of distribution (V) was 2.43 L (95% CI 2.25-2.63). For metabolite oxypurinol, CL and V relative to a formation fraction (f) were 0.26 L\/h (95% CI 0.23-0.3) and 11 L (95% CI 9.9-12.2), respectively. No difference in allopurinol and oxypurinol CL was found between TH and non-TH patients. The effect of allopurinol and oxypurinol on XO inhibition was described by a turnover model of hypoxanthine with sequential metabolites xanthine and uric acid. The combined allopurinol and oxypurinol concentration at the half-maximal XO inhibition was 0.36 mg\/L (95% CI 0.31-0.42).\nCONCLUSION: The PK and PD of allopurinol, oxypurinol, hypoxanthine, xanthine, and uric acid in neonates with HIE were described. The dosing regimen applied in the ALBINO trial leads to the targeted XO inhibition in neonates treated with or without TH.",

Although the high prevalence and increased severity of gout in this cohort has been well documented, there has been little qualitative research undertaken in Australia into the lived experience of this group of people. It is this gap in the research that our study aimed to address.\nMETHODS: Participants were recruited from the rheumatology clinics at Westmead and Blacktown Hospitals. Those eligible to participate were Pacific Islander and Māori patients with tophaceous gout currently living in the Western Sydney Local Health District (WSLHD). Data collection took the form of 10 semi-structured interviews, which were subsequently transcribed verbatim. A thematic analysis of the data was then performed.\nRESULTS: Thematic analysis identified 6 key themes: lack of understanding of the disease and its potential effects; missed opportunities for intervention and disjointed care; chronic reliance upon corticosteroids; trivialization of gout as a nuisance illness; the substantial financial impact of chronic illness; and the all-consuming nature of severe gout.\nCONCLUSION: The human cost of severe tophaceous gout in this cohort is immense. All 10 participants exemplified the disease's devastating social effects. We propose 4 key recommendations: improved education regarding diagnosis and management; immediate prescription of ULT at first presentation; a lower threshold for out-of-hospital rheumatologist referral; and improved follow-up through a nurse- and pharmacist-led collaborative gout management program.",

This study explored whether interventional treatments for excessive SUA reduction were harmful and what constituted the optimal lowering of SUA levels for the prevention of events in patients with asymptomatic hyperuricaemia.\nMETHODS: This was a post hoc analysis of a randomized trial (Febuxostat for Cerebral and CaRdiorenovascular Events PrEvEntion StuDy [FREED]) in which 1070 older patients with asymptomatic hyperuricaemia were enrolled and allocated to febuxostat (n = 537) or non-febuxostat treatment group (n = 533). We assessed the relationship between the endpoint (withdrawal or study completion) SUA levels and clinical outcomes. Primary endpoint was defined as a composite of all-cause mortality, cerebral and cardiorenovascular events.\nRESULTS: In the febuxostat group, patients achieving SUA levels ≤4 mg\/dl (hazard ratio: 2.01 [95% CI: 1.05, 3.87]), >4 to ≤5 mg\/dl (2.12 [1.07, 4.20], >6 to ≤7 mg\/dl (2.42 [1.05, 5.60]), and >7 mg\/dl (4.73 [2.13, 10.5]) had significantly higher risks for a primary composite event than those achieving SUA levels >5 to ≤6 mg\/dl (P = 0.003 [log-rank test]). This J-shaped relationship applied to patients with renal impairment (P = 0.007 [Gray's test]) and was not significant in the non-febuxostat treatment group (P = 0.212 [log-rank test]).\nCONCLUSION: Optimal SUA level by febuxostat treatment is 5-6 mg\/dl for reducing all-cause mortality, cerebral, cardiovascular and renal events. Excessive SUA reduction may be harmful in older hyperuricaemic populations.\nTRIAL REGISTRATION: ClinicalTrial.gov, https:\/\/clinicaltrials.gov, NCT01984749.",

In gout patients, urate metabolism has had a positive balance for a time period of weeks to years before the arthritic syndrome or tophaecous disease becomes manifest. This may be due to katabolism or weight loss, enhanced dietary affluence, and overweight resulting in increased serum urate levels. Also, a decreased urate excretion results in proneness to hyperuricaemia and clinical gout. Pharmacotherapeutically, a negative urate balance should be the aim of clinicians and then the rational choice of treatment with uricosurics seems quite logical and promising, but has not had a thorough attention of pharma, researchers nor of clinicians, though most gout patients were and still are low excretors. Here, an overview on the 70-year-old journey mankind has made in a search for uricosurics resulting so far in only 1 registered uricosuric per continent.",

        "Abstract":"INTRODUCTION: Tumor lysis syndrome (TLS) is a commonly observed oncological emergency that requires prompt diagnosis and treatment. Rasburicase is a recombinant urate oxidase endorsed in TLS for the treatment of hyperuricemia. The effect of single-dose 7.5 mg rasburicase at longer follow-ups was not widely investigated.\nPATIENTS AND METHODS: Eighty-two patients included in the study with clinical TLS and laboratory TLS. The primary endpoint was the normalization of uric acid (<6mg\/dL) within 24 hours of rasburicase administration, which was described as treatment success. The secondary endpoint was defined as having sustained response at the first week. The third endpoint was defined as the reaching the baseline renal function before TLS.\nRESULTS: We found that the use of a 7.5 mg dose of rasburicase controlled uric acid in 74 of 82 (90,2%) patients at the 24th hour. In the first week, uric acid remained at normal levels in 69 of 82 (84,1%) patients. At 24 hours, the TLS risk group was the only predictor for failing uric acid normalization; at the end of the first week, no predictive factor was identified for failing uric acid normalization.\nCONCLUSION: Rasburicase at 7.5 mg dose is an important agent for controlling laboratory and clinical TLS at 24 hours and extending its effect to the first week.",

Scotland-wide data on urate-lowering therapy prescriptions and hospital admissions with gout were analysed between 2009 and 2020. Local data on urate tests were analysed between 2014 and 2015.\nRESULTS: Admissions with a primary diagnosis of gout in Lothian reduced modestly following the intervention from 111\/year in 2010-2014 to 104\/year in 2015-2019, a non-significant difference (P = 0.32). In contrast there was a significant increase in admissions to remaining NHS Scotland health boards (556\/year vs 606\/year, P < 0.01). For a secondary diagnosis of gout the number of admissions in NHS Lothian reduced significantly (58\/year vs 39\/year, P < 0.01) contrasting with a significant increase in remaining Scottish health boards (220\/year vs 290\/year, P < 0.01). The relative rate of admissions to NHS Lothian compared with remaining Scottish boards using a 2009 baseline were significantly reduced for both primary diagnosis of gout (1.06 vs 1.25, P < 0.001) and secondary diagnoses of gout (0.64 compared with 1.4, P < 0.001) after the intervention; however, there was no difference before the intervention. A relative increase in the prescription rates of allopurinol 300 mg tablets and febuxostat 120 mg tablets may have contributed to the improved outcomes seen.\nCONCLUSION: Incorporation of clinical guideline advice into routine reporting of urate results was associated with reduced rates of admission with gout in NHS Lothian, in comparison with other Scottish health boards.",

The aim of our study was to identify the characteristic dysbiosis of the gut microbiota in gout patients and the impact of a commonly used uric acid-lowering treatment, febuxostat on gut microbiota in gout. 16S ribosomal RNA sequencing and metagenomic shotgun sequencing was performed on fecal DNA isolated from 38 untreated gout patients, 38 gout patients treated with febuxostat, and 26 healthy controls. A restriction of gut microbiota biodiversity was detected in the untreated gout patients, and the alteration was partly restored by febuxostat. Biochemical metabolic indexes involved in liver and kidney metabolism were significantly associated with the gut microbiota composition in gout patients. Functional analysis revealed that the gut microbiome of gout patients had an enriched function on carbohydrate metabolism but a lower potential for purine metabolism, which was comparatively enhanced in the febuxostat treated gout patients. A classification microbial model obtained a high mean area under the curve up to 0.973. Therefore, gut dysbiosis characterizings gout could potentially serve as a noninvasive diagnostic tool for gout and may be a promising target of future preventive interventions.",

        "Abstract":"AIMS: With the high prevalence of gout and associated cardiovascular (CV) diseases, information on the comparative CV safety of individual urate-lowering drugs becomes increasingly important. However, few studies examined the CV risk of uricosuric agents. We compared CV risk among patients with gout who initiated allopurinol vs. benzbromarone.\nMETHODS AND RESULTS: Using the Korean National Health Insurance claims data (2002-17), we conducted a cohort study of 124 434 gout patients who initiated either allopurinol (n = 103 695) or benzbromarone (n = 20 739), matched on propensity score at a 5:1 ratio. The primary outcome was a composite CV endpoint of myocardial infarction, stroke\/transient ischaemic attack, or coronary revascularization. To account for competing risk of death, we used cause-specific hazard models to estimate hazard ratios (HRs) and 95% confidence intervals (CIs) for the outcomes comparing allopurinol initiators with benzbromarone. Over a mean follow-up of 1.16 years, 2258 patients developed a composite CV event. The incidence rate of the composite CV event was higher in allopurinol initiators (1.81 per 100 person-years) than benzbromarone (1.61 per 100 person-years) with a HR of 1.22 (95% CI 1.05-1.41). The HR for all-cause mortality was 1.66 (95% CI 1.43-1.93) among allopurinol initiators compared with benzbromarone.\nCONCLUSION: In this large population-based cohort of gout patients, allopurinol was associated with an increased risk of composite CV events and all-cause mortality compared to benzbromarone. Benzbromarone may reduce CV risk and mortality in patients with gout, although more studies are necessary to confirm our findings and to advance our understanding of the underlying mechanisms.",

In this context, a series of geniposide derivatives were designed and synthesized, and antihyperuricemic and nephroprotective effects of all derivatives was evaluated in vitro and in vivo. Compound 2e emerged as the most potent XOD inhibitor, with an IC value of 6.67 ± 0.46 µM. Simultaneously, cell viability, ROS generation, and SOD levels assay showed that compound 2e could repair the damage of HKC cells by inhibiting the oxidative stress response. The results of the study indicated compound 2e significantly decreased uric acid levels by inhibiting the XOD activity, and repaired kidney damage by inhibiting the expression of TLR4\/TLR2\/MyD88\/NF-κB and NALP3\/ASC\/caspase-1 signaling pathways. Enzyme inhibition kinetics suggested that compound 2e functioned via reversible mixed competitive inhibition. Moreover, a molecular docking study was performed to gain insight into the binding mode of compound 2e with XOD. These results suggest that geniposide derivatives were potential to be developed into a novel medicine to reveal healthy benefits in natural prevention and reduction risk of hyperuricemia and kidney damage.",

Any controlled clinical trial, randomised controlled trial (RCT), retrospective cohort study or open label trial (OLT) comparing febuxostat in patients with gout or hyperuricemia with allopurinol. The quality of all identified studies was assessed based on Cochrane Collaboration's risk of bias tool. Odds ratios (OR) were calculated with random effects and reported with corresponding 95% confidence intervals (CI).\nRESULTS: Eighteen studies were ultimately included in the analysis, among them 6 articles mentioned serum uric acid (sUA) level before and after treatment, 14 articles mentioned major cardiovascular events, 5 articles mentioned cardiovascular death, 6 articles mentioned skin reactions, 6 articles mentioned musculoskeletal and connective tissue signs and symptoms, 4 articles mentioned joint-related signs and symptoms, 6 articles mentioned upper respiratory infection, 5 articles mentioned gastrointestinal reaction and 7 articles mentioned all-cause mortality. The febuxostat group showed significantly lower sUA levels than allopurinol group (MD =-0.83, 95% CI: -1.22 to -0.44, P<0.0001, I2=98%). There was no markedly difference between the febuxostat and allopurinol (OR 1.01, 95% CI: 0.83 to 1.23, P=0.84, I2=95%) in the major cardiovascular events.

However, among patients with gout or hyperuricemia, treatment with febuxostat resulted in other adverse reactions, including all-causes mortality similar to those associated with allopurinol.\nDISCUSSION: The limitation of the study was the included studies show high heterogeneity in regard to their design. There was no difference in the incidence of major cardiovascular events between febuxostat and allopurinol, and febuxostat was better in lowering uric acid and has less adverse skin reactions than allopurinol, but the risk of CV death of febuxostat was higher than allopurinol.",

Therefore, finding a safe medication that does not have severe side-effects is a goal shared by most physicians. The current study aimed to evaluate the effect of lesinurad (Zurampic; ZUR) and allopurinol (ALP), both alone or in combination, on the treatment of hyperuricemic mice at the biochemical, molecular and cellular levels. &lt;b&gt;Materials and Methods:&lt;\/b&gt; Lesinurad and allopurinol were orally administered to hyperuricemic and control mice for seven consecutive days, either alone or in combination. Levels of uric acid and xanthine oxidase activity, blood urea nitrogen, creatinine, ALT and AST were measured in the serum. The mRNA expression of mouse hepatic guanine deaminase (Gda), purine nucleotide phosphorylase (PNP), renal urate anion transporter-1 (URAT-1) and OAT-1 transporters were examined. The renal tissues were examined using H and E staining and the immunoreactivity technique. &lt;b&gt;Results:&lt;\/b&gt; Lesinurad and allopurinol administration resulted in a significant decrease in serum levels of uric acid, blood urea nitrogen and xanthine oxidase activity reported in hyperuricemic mice. Both partially reversed oxonate-induced alterations in renal mURAT-1 and mOAT-1 expressions, as well as alterations in the immunoreactivity of Bcl2. All showed an increase in renal uric acid secretion and excretion. ALP and ZUT significantly decreased the increase in Gda and PNP expression reported in hyperuricemic mice. The combined administration of ZUR and ALP restored and improved renal function histopathological changes reported in hyperuricemic mice. &lt;b&gt;Conclusion:&lt;\/b&gt; The hypouricemic impact of both lesinurad and allopurinol in the treatment of hyperuricemia in mice was confirmed following hyperuricemia treatment.",

Thirty-six adults (aged 58 [55;63] years) with or without primary hypertension participated in a three-way, randomized, double-blind, crossover study in which [placebo] and [febuxostat] and [febuxostat and rasburicase] were administered. Febuxostat and rasburicase reduce the uric acid concentration by xanthine oxidoreductase inhibition and uric acid degradation into allantoin, respectively. Endothelial function was assessed in response to acetylcholine, sodium nitroprusside, heating (with and without nitric oxide synthase inhibition) using a laser Doppler imager. Arterial stiffness was determined by applanation tonometry, together with blood pressure, renin-angiotensin system activity, oxidative stress, and inflammation. Uric acid concentration was 5.1 [4.1;5.9], 1.9 [1.2;2.2] and 0.2 [0.2;0.3] mg\/dL with [placebo], [febuxostat] and [febuxostat-rasburicase] treatments, respectively (p < 0.0001). Febuxostat improved endothelial response to heat particularly when nitric oxide synthase was inhibited (p < 0.05) and reduced diastolic and mean arterial pressure (p = 0.008 and 0.02, respectively). The augmentation index decreased with febuxostat (ANOVA p < 0.04). Myeloperoxidase activity profoundly decreased with febuxostat combined with rasburicase (p < 0.0001). When uric acid dropped, plasmatic antioxidant capacity markedly decreased, while superoxide dismutase activity increased (p < 0.0001). Other inflammatory and oxidant markers did not differ.

Dotinurad is a novel uric acid-lowering drug classified as a selective urate reabsorption inhibitor. A pooled analysis was performed on the uric acid-lowering effect of dotinurad in 222 hypertensive patients with gout or asymptomatic hyperuricemia in four clinical trials (NCT02344862, NCT02416167, NCT03100318, NCT03372200). Moreover, we analyzed the long-term uric acid-lowering effect of dotinurad in 154 hypertensive patients with gout or asymptomatic hyperuricemia (NCT03006445).: In the pooled analysis, the percent change in the decrease of serum uric acid with the use of dotinurad was 42.17 ± 12.42% at a dose of 2 mg and 60.42 ± 8.03% at a dose of 4 mg; the percentage of patients who achieved a serum uric acid level of ≤6.0 mg\/dL was 82.8% and 100.0%. The long-term uric acid-lowering effect of dotinurad showed almost the same results. In this study, the concomitant use of diuretics or angiotensin II receptor blockers affected the uric acid-lowering effect of dotinurad at only a dose of 2 mg in the pooled analysis.: In the pooled analysis, dotinurad lowered serum uric acid levels. Dotinurad has an achievement rate of over 80% for serum uric acid level of ≤6.0 mg\/dL in both analyses, and will be clinically useful for the management of hyperuricemic states in hypertensive patients.",

        "Abstract":"['Background:', 'Method:', 'Results:', 'Conclusion:']\nHyperuricemia is very common in patients with chronic kidney disease (CKD); the role of hyperuricemia in the occurrence and progression of kidney disease remains an interesting and unresolved issue for nephrologists, and whether urate-lowering therapy (ULT) is warranted in CKD patients is still in controversy. To summarize and compare the clinical outcomes and adverse events (AEs) of three common ULT drugs, we performed a systematic review and network meta-analysis of randomized clinical trials (RCTs).  PubMed, MEDLINE, Clinical Trials.gov, EMBASE, and the Cochrane Central Register of Controlled Trials electronic databases were searched. The network meta-analysis was performed using the \"gemtc 0.8-7\" and its dependent packages in R software. The primary outcome was the change of renal function and uric acid; creatinine, proteinuria, blood pressure, and adverse events were assessed as the secondary outcomes.  16 RCTs involving 1,943 patients were included in the final network analysis. Febuxostat, allopurinol, and benzbromarone were not found to exert superior effects over placebo upon renoprotective effect. With respect to lowering urate, the three drugs showed to be statistically superior to placebo, while febuxostat could better lower urate than allopurinol (MD: -1.547; 95% CrI: -2.473 to -0.626). It is also indicated that febuxostat was superior to placebo at controlling blood pressure, while no differences were observed when allopurinol and benzbromarone were compared to placebo. These results are stable in subgroup analysis.  There is insufficient evidence to support the renoprotective effects of the three urate-lowering agents in CKD patients with hyperuricemia; febuxostat shows a tendency to be superior to allopurinol on lowering the decline of eGFR and increment of proteinturia, but the difference does not reach a statistical significance. Regarding its urate-lowering effect, febuxostat appears to be a satisfactory alternative to allopurinol and benzbromarone, and can control blood pressure better.",

Exclusion criteria were advanced renal failure, ongoing ULT, and presence of the HLA-B*5801 allele. Allopurinol was used on days 1 and 14 in early and late groups, respectively. Primary outcome was time to complete arthritis resolution, and secondary outcomes were time to clinical resolution; arthritis relapse; laboratory parameters; and adverse events.\nRESULTS: One hundred seventeen patients were randomized to early and late allopurinol groups (n = 59 and 58, respectively). One patient in each group was lost to follow-up; therefore, 115 patients were included in the modified intention-to-treat analysis. Baseline characteristics were comparable between the groups. The median time to complete resolution was not significantly different between the early and late allopurinol groups (6 [5-14] and 6 [5-7] days, respectively; p = 0.14). The median time to clinical resolution was 4 [3-6] days in both groups (p = 0.12). Other secondary outcomes were not significantly different. Serious adverse events did not occur in either group.\nCONCLUSIONS: Early allopurinol initiation during an acute gout flare did not lead to significant changes in time to resolution, flare recurrence, and inflammatory markers.

        "Abstract":"Microbial urate oxidase has emerged as a potential source of therapeutic properties for hyperuricemia in arthritic gout and renal disease. The thermostability and long-term thermal tolerance of the enzyme need to be established to prolong its therapeutic effects. Here, we present the biochemical and structural aspects of a hyperthermostable urate oxidase (TbUox) from the thermophilic microorganism Thermobispora bispora. Enzymatic characterization of TbUox revealed that it was active over a wide range of temperatures, from 30 to 70 °C, with optimal activity at 65 °C and pH 8.0, which suggests its applicability under physiological conditions. Moreover, TbUox exhibits high thermostability from 10 to 65 °C, with Tm of 70.3 °C and near-neutral pH stability from pH 7.0 to 8.0 and high thermal tolerance. The crystal structures of TbUox revealed a distinct feature of the C-terminal loop extensions that may help with protein stability via inter-subunit interactions. In addition, the high thermal tolerance of TbUox may be contributed by the extensive inter-subunit contacts via salt bridges, hydrogen bonds, and hydrophobic interactions. The findings in this study provide a molecular basis for the thermophilic TbUox urate oxidase for application in hyperuricemia and gout therapy.",

        "Abstract":"BACKGROUND: Patient-centered management is becoming increasingly important in gout, but there are limited studies exploring patients' perspectives and preferences. We aimed to investigate patients' perspectives and preferences regarding gout and gout management, and their impacts on adherence to urate lowering therapy (ULT).\nMETHODS: A paper-based survey was performed in patients with gout seen at the rheumatology outpatient clinics of 16 tertiary hospitals. The survey included questions regarding demographics, comorbidities, gout attacks, current treatment and adherence, and patients' perspectives and preferences regarding gout and gout management. Multivariate regression analysis was performed to determine the factors associated with ULT adherence.\nRESULTS: Of 809 surveyed patients with gout, 755 (94.5%) were using ULT. Among those using ULT, 89.1% had ≥ 80% adherence to ULT. Majority of the patients knew management strategies to some extent (94.8%), perceived gout as a life-long disease (91.2%), and were making efforts toward practicing at least one lifestyle modification (89.2%). Most patients (71.9%) obtained information about gout management during their clinic visits. Approximately half of the patients (53.6%) preferred managing their disease with both ULT and lifestyle modification, 28.4% preferred ULT only, and 17.4% preferred lifestyle modification only. Adherence was better in patients with older age (odds ratio [OR], 1.03), those with better knowledge of gout management strategies (OR, 3.56), and those who had preference for ULT (OR, 2.07).\nCONCLUSION: Patients' perspectives and management preferences had high impacts on adherence to ULT in gout. Consideration of patients' perspectives and preferences is important for achieving the desired clinical outcome in gout.",

        "Abstract":"PURPOSE: Allopurinol is a potent inhibitor of the enzyme xanthine oxidase used primarily in the treatment of hyperuricemia and gout. The aim of this study was to compare the analgesic efficacy of preanesthetic allopurinol versus placebo on postoperative pain and anxiety in patients undergoing abdominal hysterectomy.\nMETHODS: This is a prospective, double-blinded, placebo-controlled, randomized clinical trial. We investigated 54 patients scheduled to undergo elective abdominal hysterectomy. Patients were randomly assigned to receive either oral allopurinol 300 mg (n = 27) or placebo (n = 27) the night before and 1 h before surgery. Patients were submitted to evaluation of pain and anxiety before the treatment, for 24 h postoperatively, 30 and 90 days after surgery. Cerebrospinal fluid was collected at the time of the spinal anesthesia to perform the measurement of the central levels of purines.\nRESULTS: Preoperative administration of allopurinol was effective in reducing postoperative pain 2 h after surgery. Allopurinol caused a reduction of approximately 40% in pain scores measured by the visual analogue pain scale after surgery (p < 0.05). No differences were found between groups in anxiety scores after surgery. There was a significant change in the cerebrospinal fluid concentrations of xanthine and uric acid before surgery (p < 0.01).\nCONCLUSION: This study showed a short-term benefit of the use of allopurinol as a preanesthetic medication since it was related to a reduction on pain scores 2 h after surgery. The purinergic system is a potential target for new analgesic drugs. New studies investigating more selective purine derivatives in the management of pain should be performed.\nTRIAL NUMBER REGISTRATION: Brazilian Registry of Clinical Trials-ReBEC #RBR-9pw58p.",

Hyperuricemia is a metabolic disorder characterized by a high uric acid level in serum due to an imbalance between uric acid production and excretion and causes gout. Recently, the prevalence of hyperuricemia worldwide has been continuously increasing. Xanthine oxidase (XOD) inhibitors (allopurinol (ALP) and febuxostat) and uricosuric agents (benzbromarone and probenecid) are used to treat hyperuricemia clinically. However, because these drugs are poorly tolerated and cause side effects, such as kidney diseases, hepatotoxicity, gastrointestinal symptoms, and hypersensitivity syndrome, only a limited number of drugs are available. We investigated the antihyperuricemic effects of  leaf ethanol extract (DMLE) and its underlying mechanisms of action through  and  studies. We evaluated uric acid levels in serum and urine, and xanthine oxidase (XOD) inhibition activity in the serum and liver tissue of a hyperuricemic rat model of potassium oxonate (PO)-induced hyperuricemic rats. In vitro study, XOD-inhibitory activity was the lowest among the test substances at the IC50 of ALP. However, the IC50 of DMLE-70 was significantly low compared with that of other DMLEs ( < 0.05). In PO-induced hyperuricemic rats, uric acid (UA) levels in serum and urine were significantly reduced in all DMLE-70 and allopurinol-treated (ALT) groups than in the PC group ( < 0.05). UA levels in urine were lower than those in serum in all DME groups. In PO-induced hyperuricemic rats, DMEE-200 reduced UA concentration in serum and increased UA excretion in the urine. These findings suggest that DMLE exerts antihyperuricemic and uricosuric effects on promoting UA excretion by enhanced secretion and inhibition of UA reabsorption in the kidneys. Thus, DMLE may be a potential treatment for hyperuricemia and gout.",

Herein, the effects of dotinurad were compared among patient groups with different stages of renal dysfunction.\nMETHODS: Patient data from four clinical trials were pooled and divided into four groups according to the stage of renal dysfunction to compare the effects of dotinurad at different stages. The grouping (stages G1-G3b) was based on the estimated glomerular filtration rate (eGFR) of the patients. In addition, patient data from a long-term study (34 or 58 weeks) were evaluated in the same manner.\nRESULTS: In the pooled analysis, the percentage of patients achieving a serum uric acid level of ≤ 6.0 mg\/dL was 64.7-100.0% at a dose of 2 or 4 mg. In the long-term analysis, the percentage of patients achieving a serum uric acid level of ≤ 6.0 mg\/dL was 60.0-100.0% at a dose of 2 or 4 mg. Although the outcomes in stage G3b were worse due to higher baseline serum uric acid levels, satisfactory outcomes were observed in all stages. Even in stages G3a and G3b, when renal function declined, the eGFR remained constant throughout the dose period.\nCONCLUSION: The efficacy of dotinurad was confirmed in hyperuricemic patients with normal renal function (stage G1) and mild to moderate renal dysfunction (stage G2-G3b).

It has been recently reported that the change ratio in TNFR1 by SGLT2 inhibitor treatment is also related with future GFR decline in patients with diabetes. The aims of this study are to investigate the association between baseline TNFR levels and early change in TNFR levels by the non-purine selective xanthine oxidase inhibitor, febuxostat, and future eGFR decline chiefly in chronic kidney disease (CKD) patients without diabetes.  We conducted a  analysis of the FEATHER study on patients with asymptomatic hyperuricemia and CKD stage 3, who were randomly assigned febuxostat 40 mg\/day or matched placebo. This analysis included 426 patients in whom baseline stored samples were available. Serum TNFR levels at baseline were measured using enzyme-linked immunosorbent assay. Those levels were also measured using 12-week stored samples from 197 randomly selected patients.  Compared with placebo, short-term febuxostat treatment significantly decreased the median percent change from baseline in serum uric acid (-45.05, 95% CI -48.90 to -41.24 mg\/dL), TNFR1 (1.10, 95% CI-2.25 to 4.40), and TNFR2 (1.66, 95% CI -1.72 to 4.93), but not TNFR levels. Over a median follow-up of 105 weeks, 30 patients (7.0%) experienced 30% eGFR decline from baseline. In the Cox multivariate model, high levels of baseline TNFR predicted a 30% eGFR decline, even after adjusting for age, sex, systolic blood pressure, high sensitivity C-reactive protein, uric acid, and presence or absence of febuxostat treatment and diabetes, in addition to baseline albumin to creatinine ratio and eGFR.  Early change in circulating TNFR levels failed to predict future eGFR decline; however, regardless of febuxostat treatment, the elevated baseline level of TNFR was a strong predictor of 30% eGFR decline even in chiefly non-diabetic CKD patients with asymptomatic hyperuricemia.",

Four risk groups were developed: low (no items), moderate (one item), high (two items) and very high risk (three or four items). In a population with frequent (overall 34%) in-hospital gout flares, 80% of people with very high risk developed inpatient flares while 11% with low risk had inpatient flares.\nCONCLUSION: The GOUT-36 rule is simple and sensitive for classifying people with high risk for inpatient gout flares.

Studies were included if they evaluated the effectiveness and\/or implementation of interventions during hospital admissions or emergency department attendances for gout flares. Risk of bias assessments were performed for included studies.\nRESULTS: Nineteen articles were included. Most studies were small, retrospective analyses performed in single centres, with concerns for bias. Eleven studies (including five randomized controlled trials) reported improved patient outcomes following pharmacological interventions with known efficacy in gout, including allopurinol, prednisolone, NSAIDs and anakinra. Eight studies reported improved outcomes associated with non-pharmacological interventions: inpatient rheumatology consultation and a hospital gout management protocol. No studies to date have prospectively evaluated strategies designed to prevent re-admissions of patients hospitalized for gout flares.\nCONCLUSION: There is an urgent need for high-quality, prospective studies of strategies for improving uptake of urate-lowering therapies in hospitalized patients, incorporating prophylaxis against flares and treat-to-target optimization of serum urate levels.

        "Published":"2021-07-01",
        "Abstract":"Hyperuricemia is a common metabolic condition, cause by increased levels of serum urate (SUA). Reduced excretion of uric acid is reported as the key factor of primary hyperuricemia, accounting for approximately 90% of the cases. Urate transporter 1 (URAT1) is a major protein involved in uric acid reabsorption (about 90%). Therefore, URAT1 inhibitors are considered to be a highly effective and promising class of uricosuric agents for treating hyperuricemia. This review summarizes the development of URAT1 inhibitors for the treatment of hyperuricemia, including approved URAT1 inhibitors, URAT1 inhibitors under development in clinical trials, substances with URAT1 inhibitory effects from derivatives and natural products, and conventional drugs with new uses. This review provides new ideas regarding research on URAT1 inhibitors by introducing the structure, properties, and side effects of chemical drugs, as well as the sources and categories of natural drugs. We also discuss new mechanisms of classic drugs, which may provide guidance to many practicing clinicians. The research and discovery of new inhibitors remain in full swing, and tremendous developments are expected in the field.",

        "Abstract":"['Background:', 'Methods:', 'Results:', 'Conclusion:']\nHyperuricemia is a common metabolic disease and has become a public health problem because of its increasing prevalence and association with comorbidities. Allopurinol and febuxostat are recommended as the first-line treatments for hyperuricemia and gout. But cardiovascular safety between febuxostat and allopurinol is still controversial. The purpose of this study is to compare the cardiovascular safety of XOIs and placebo in hyperuricemic patients with or without gout.  PubMed, Embase via OVID, Cochrane Library, CNKI, Wanfang, and VIP were searched from their earliest records to February 8th 2021. ClinicalTrials.gov was also searched for unpublished data. The reference lists of included studies and relevant review articles investigating the cardiovascular safety of XOIs in hyperuricemia patients are screened for potentially eligible studies. Randomized controlled trials (RCTs) evaluating allopurinol (100~900 mg\/d), febuxostat (20~120 mg\/d), or placebo for hyperuricemia were included. The outcomes were incidence of MACE, non-fatal MI, non-fatal stroke, and cardiovascular death. We conducted a Bayesian random-effects network meta-analysis on the included randomized controlled trials using the Markov Chain Monte Carlo simulation method. The grading of recommendations assessment, development, and evaluation (GRADE) approach was used to assesses the certainty of the evidence.  Ten RCTs with 18,004 participants were included. The network estimates showed that there was no significant difference observed among febuxostat, allopurinol, and placebo regarding outcomes. The certainty of the evidence ranged from very low to moderate. The probabilities of rankings and SUCRA showed that compared to placebo, febuxostat, and allopurinol might prevent adverse cardiovascular events.  Febuxostat is not associated with increasing risk of adverse cardiovascular events compared to allopurinol; and compared to placebo, whether febuxostat and allopurinol reduce the risk of adverse cardiovascular events remains uncertain.",

        "Abstract":"In the present study, in silico predictions and molecular docking were performed on five clerodane diterpenes (1-5) from Polyalthia longifolia seeds to evaluate their potential as xanthine oxidase (XO) inhibitors. The initial screening was conducted by target prediction using TargetNet web server application and only compounds 3 and 4 showed a potential interaction with XO. Compounds 3 and 4 were subsequently subjected to in silico analyses on XO protein structure (PDB: 1N5X) using Schrödinger Release 2020-3 followed by structural modeling & molecular simulation studies to confirm the initial prediction result and identify the binding mode of these compounds to the XO. Molecular docking results revealed that compounds 3 (-37.3 kcal\/mol) and 4 (-32.0 kcal\/mol) binds more stably to XO than the reference drug allopurinol (-27.0 kcal\/mol). Interestingly, two residues Glu 802 and Thr 1010 were observed as the two main H-bond binding sites for both tested compounds and the allopurinol. The center scaffold of allopurinol was positioned by some π-π stacking with Phe 914 and Phe 1009, while that of compounds 3 and 4 were supported by many hydrophobic interactions mainly with Leu 648, Phe 649, Phe 1013, and Leu 1014. Additionally, the docking simulation predicted that the inhibitory effect of compounds 3 and 4 was mediated by creating H-bond with particularly Glu 802, which is a key amino acid for XO enzyme inhibition. Altogether, in vitro studies showed that compounds 3 and 4 had better inhibitory capacity against XO enzyme with IC50 values significantly (p < 0.001) lower than that of allopurinol. In short, the present study identified cleroda-4(18),13-dien-15,16-olide as novel potential XO inhibitors, which can be potentially used for the treatment of gout.",

        "Abstract":"PURPOSE: Hyperuricemia is a common disease that may lead to gout, renal damage, and cardiovascular events. Oral medication is the main treatment for hyperuricemia patients when lifestyle intervention fails. An evaluation of the safety of various urate-lowering therapies (ULTs) is integral to clinical decision-making. We constructed a network meta-analysis (NMA) to evaluate the safety of oral ULTs.\nMETHODS: MEDLINE, EMBASE, and the Cochrane Central Register of Controlled Trials were searched up to April 1, 2021, for randomized controlled trials that examined the safety of ULTs. The language restriction was English. The three outcomes used to assess the safety of uric acid lowering medications were treatment-related adverse events, liver damage, and major adverse cardiovascular events (MACE).\nRESULTS: Thirty-two trials enrolling 23,868 individuals were included in the study. In terms of treatment-related adverse events, there were no statistically significant differences between five uric acid lowering medications and placebo: allopurinol (risk ratio (RR): 1.08; 95% credible interval (CrI): 0.91, 1.29), febuxostat (RR: 1.05; 95% CrI: 0.89, 1.25), lesinurad (RR: 1.19; 95% CrI: 0.85, 1.67), lesinurad combined with xanthine oxidase inhibitor (XOI, RR: 1.05; 95% CrI: 0.83, 1.32), and topiroxostat (RR: 1.01; 95% CrI: 0.83, 1.23). Topiroxostat likely increases risk of liver damage (RR: 2.65; 95%CI: 1.24, 5.70; NNH: 33.40) as compared with placebo. With regard to MACE, there were no statistically significant differences between three uric acid lowering medications and placebo: allopurinol (RR: 0.63; 95% CrI: 0.36, 1.34), febuxostat (RR: 0.69; 95% CrI: 0.38, 1.66), and lesinurad combined with XOI (RR: 0.56; 95% CrI: 0.23, 1.85). The rankings of different interventions were depicted by cumulative ranking curve (SUCRA).\nCONCLUSIONS: Through NMA, we provide some evidence for the safety of ULTs.

        "Abstract":"OBJECTIVES: In patients with gout, treating to target serum uric acid levels (sUA) of ≤6.0 mg\/dL is universally recommended to prevent gout flare. However, there is no consensus on asymptomatic hyperuricaemia. Using Japanese health insurance claims data, we explored potential benefits of sUA control for preventing gout flare in subjects with asymptomatic hyperuricaemia.\nMETHODS: This retrospective cohort study analysed the JMDC Claims Database from April 2012 through June 2019. Subjects with sUA ≥8.0 mg\/dL were identified, and disease status (prescriptions for urate-lowering therapy (ULT), occurrence of gout flare, sUA) was investigated for 1 year. Time to first onset and incidence rate of gout flare were determined by disease status subgroups for 2 years or more. The relationship between gout flare and sUA control was assessed using multivariable analysis.\nRESULTS: The analysis population was 19 261 subjects who met eligibility criteria. We found fewer occurrences of gout flare, for both gout and asymptomatic hyperuricaemia, in patients who achieved sUA ≤6.0 mg\/dL with ULT than in patients whose sUA remained >6.0 mg\/dL or who were not receiving ULT. In particular, analysis by a Cox proportional-hazard model for time to first gout flare indicated that the HR was lowest, at 0.45 (95% CI 0.27 to 0.76), in subjects with asymptomatic hyperuricaemia on ULT (5.0<sUA ≤ 6.0 mg\/dL), compared with untreated subjects (sUA ≥8.0 mg\/dL).\nCONCLUSIONS: Occurrences of gout flare were reduced by controlling sUA at ≤6.0 mg\/dL in subjects with asymptomatic hyperuricaemia as well as in those with gout.\nTRIAL REGISTRATION NUMBER: UMIN000039985.",

        "Abstract":"BACKGROUND: International rheumatology guidelines advocate a treat to serum urate target (T2T) approach for gout management. While individual studies have reported regional and national-level gout management, global patterns in gout care have not been synthesized. This study aimed to systematically review and meta-analyze global T2T care for patients with gout.\nMETHODS: Electronic databases were searched for studies reporting medication and serum urate testing in patients with gout. Meta-analyses were conducted to determine the pooled proportion of patients with gout achieving pre-specified T2T indicators.\nRESULTS: Sixty-seven papers were included from North America (n = 31 studies), Europe (n = 22), Oceania (n = 7), Asia (n = 6), and reporting data from multiple continents (n = 1). The global pooled percentages (95% confidence interval (CI)) of patients with gout achieving T2T indicators were: 52% (45%, 59%) on urate lowering therapy (ULT), 50% (40%, 61%) on ULT receiving regular uninterrupted ULT, 53% (40%, 65%) on ULT having any serum urate testing, and 34% (28%, 41%) on ULT achieving a serum urate target.\nCONCLUSION: Outside North America and Europe, there are relatively few studies about T2T care for gout management. However, available data demonstrate that a minority of people with gout receive T2T care worldwide. For those prescribed ULT, there are low rates of continuous therapy, serum urate testing, and achievement of serum urate target.",

        "Abstract":"Xanthine oxidoreductase (XOR), a rate-limiting and catalyzing enzyme of uric acid formation in purine metabolism, is involved in reactive oxygen species generation. Plasma XOR activity has been shown to be a novel metabolic biomarker related to obesity, liver dysfunction, hyperuricemia, dyslipidemia, and insulin resistance. However, the association between plasma XOR activity and hypertension has not been fully elucidated. We investigated the association of hypertension with plasma XOR activity in 271 nondiabetic subjects (male\/female: 119\/152) who had not taken any medications in the Tanno-Sobetsu Study, a population-based cohort. Males had higher plasma XOR activity than females. Plasma XOR activity was positively correlated with mean arterial pressure (r = 0.128, P = 0.036). When the subjects were divided by the presence and absence of hypertension into an HT group (male\/female: 34\/40) and a non-HT group (male\/female: 85\/112), plasma XOR activity in the HT group was significantly higher than that in the non-HT group (median: 39 vs. 28 pmol\/h\/mL, P = 0.028). There was no significant difference in uric acid levels between the two groups. Multivariable logistic regression analysis showed that plasma XOR activity (odds ratio: 1.091 [95% confidence interval: 1.023-1.177] per 10 pmol\/h\/mL, P = 0.007) was an independent determinant of the risk for hypertension after adjustment for age, sex, current smoking and alcohol consumption, estimated glomerular filtration rate, brain natriuretic peptide, and insulin resistance index. The interaction of sex with plasma XOR activity was not significant for the risk of hypertension. In conclusion, plasma XOR activity is independently associated with hypertension in nondiabetic individuals who are not taking any medications.",

        "Abstract":"INTRODUCTION: Tumor lysis syndrome is an oncologic emergency characterized by hyperuricemia. Previous studies have demonstrated that a fixed-dose strategy of rasburicase is as effective as the FDA approved weight-based dose. Albany Medical Center employs rasburicase 1.5 mg in patients with a uric acid (UA) between 8 and 12 mg\/dL and 3 mg for UA above12 mg\/dL.We aimed to evaluate the UA lowering effectiveness and provider adherence to the institutional protocol, as well as the cost-efficiency of this dosing strategy.\nMETHODS: This is a single center, retrospective, cohort study. The electronic medical record was used to identify patients receiving rasburicase and to collect baseline demographic and laboratory data. The fixed-dose strategies of rasburicase 1.5 mg and 3 mg were compared in their degree of UA reduction and clinical outcomes. Cost-savings of fixed-dosing was compared to the FDA-approved weight-based dose.\nRESULTS: Mean UA reduction in the 1.5 mg group (n = 49) from baseline to 24 hours was 2.88 ± 0.88 mg\/dL (p < 0.0001) and 4.83 ± 1.39 mg\/dL (p < 0.0001) in the 3 mg group (n = 105). A subgroup analysis of patients who received per protocol initial doses of rasburicase showed a mean reduction in UA from baseline to 24 hours of 2.83 ± 0.62 mg\/dL in the 1.5 mg group (n = 42) and 6.12 ± 1.87 mg\/dL in the 3 mg group (n = 42). Using a low fixed-dose approach resulted in a cost-savings of $138,077.30 annually.\nCONCLUSION: Low fixed-dose rasburicase was an effective treatment, with a dose of 1.5 mg being sufficient to reach a goal UA of less than 8 mg\/dL for serum UA levels below 12 mg\/dL, while a 3 mg dose is appropriate for levels above 12 mg\/dL. Cost analysis indicates this strategy is more cost-efficient than the FDA-approved weight-based dose.",

In a prospective cohort study, we followed 5196 patients admitted for a MI between 2006 and 2018. We assessed the relationship between baseline uricemia and the incidence of all-cause death and cardiovascular mortality and the effect of long-term allopurinol treatment. Hyperuricemia was defined as serum uric acid >450 μmol\/l in men and >360 μmol\/l in women.  In the entire cohort, the 1-year all-cause and cardiovascular mortality rates were 8 and 7.4%, and the 5-year rates were 18.3 and 15.3%, respectively. Using a fully adjusted model, hyperuricemia was associated with a 70% increased risk of both all-cause death and cardiovascular mortality at 1 year, and the negative prognostic value of hyperuricemia persisted over the 5-year follow-up (for all-cause death, hazard risk ratio = 1.45 [95% CI: 1.23-1.70] and for cardiovascular mortality, hazard risk ratio = 1.52 [95% CI: 1.28-1.80], respectively). Treatment of asymptomatic hyperuricemia with allopurinol did not affect mortality rates.

The rats' serum uric acid (SUA) level was assayed, and the rats' intake and output in 24 h were recorded. The bacterial diversity in three groups' fresh stool was analyzed. The gut bacterial diversity and abundance changed in the Kunming-DY rats. More than 99% of bacteria were inhibited or killed by the combination of antibiotics. In contrast to each of the antibiotics alone, the combination of antibiotics lowered the Kunming-DY rats' SUA level; it also caused mild diarrhea, which increased uric acid excretion through stool. These results suggested that the aboriginal gut bacteria in uricase-deficient rats play a minor role in determining the SUA levels.

Adding to the diagnostic complexity, up to 50% of patients aged > 65 years present atypically, with subacute oligo- or polyarticular flares. Comorbidity and polypharmacy, common in older populations, affect real-world treatment decisions in gout management, and no specific guidelines are available to address these issues in these at-risk groups. Despite the growing public health burden posed by gout, suboptimal management has led to increased morbidity and substantial healthcare utilization and cost burden, as reflected by an increased incidence of emergency department visits and hospitalizations in recent years. Colchicine, nonsteroidal anti-inflammatory drugs, or glucocorticoids (oral, intraarticular, or intramuscular) should be considered as first-line agents for gout flare management. Urate-lowering therapy, with the goal of lowering and maintaining serum urate concentrations at < 6 mg\/dL (< 360 μmol\/L), is recommended to achieve optimal outcomes, including regression of tophi, reduction (or elimination) of flares, and reductions in total urate burden. In this review, we summarize the current burden posed by gout and discuss best practices in its diagnosis and management, focusing on best practices in the context of gout flare in older patients with comorbid conditions.",

To compare the risk of incident CKD between users and nonusers of ULT in patients with gout, we conducted a 13-year population-based retrospective cohort study. Overall incidence of CKD was compared between 7126 ULT users and 7126 matched ULT nonusers.

We first present the biochemical and structural elucidation of a urate oxidase from the extremophile microorganism  (DrUox). From enzyme characterization, DrUox showed optimal catalytic ability at 30 °C and pH 9.0 with high stability under physiological conditions. Only the Mg ion moderately elevated its activity, which indicates the characteristic of the cofactor-free urate oxidase family. Of note, DrUox is thermostable in mesophilic conditions. It retains almost 100% activity when incubated at 25 °C and 37 °C for 24 h. In this study, we characterized a thermostable urate oxidase, DrUox with high catalytic efficiency and thermal stability, which strengthens its potential for medical applications.",

        "Abstract":"['®', '®']\nWe report the case of a 77-year-old man with Parkinson's disease (PD) who experimented for the first time gout crisis after the initiation of levodopa. Levodopa was withdrawn, and colchicine and allopurinol were initiated to treat the gout crisis. Because of PD progression, levodopa was reintroduced, and the patient presented relapse of gout flare. To further explore the association between gout and levodopa, we extracted and synthetized all Individual Case Safety Reports of gout associated with levodopa in the World Health Organization pharmacovigilance database, VigiBase , up to April 2021. 43 cases of gout were reported in VigiBase with drugs from N04BA ATC class. Levodopa was suspected in fifteen cases among which improvement was noticed in six cases (two after levodopa withdrawal, two despite treatment continuation, and two cases lacking details about action taken with levodopa); three cases did not recover; in the remaining six cases, evolution was not known. \"Hyperuricemia\" was not mentioned in the Summary of Product Characteristics of medicine containing levodopa; however, \"abnormality biologics test with uric acid\" was mentioned. Despite few cases of recovery after reduced doses of levodopa, the above-described case of positive reintroduction was an argument in favor of the role of levodopa in gout flare. This study highlights a potential association between levodopa and gout through an analysis of the cases reported in the WHO pharmacovigilance database.",

In this retrospective single-center pediatric study, the outcomes of patients with hyperleukocytosis were reviewed. There were 48 patients with acute lymphoblastic leukemia (ALL) and 13 patients with acute myeloblastic leukemia (AML). The treatment strategies included hyperhydration, allopurinol administration, strict monitoring, and early initiation of induction chemotherapy (CT). No patient underwent LPh because it was not available. Rasburicase was used only in 3 ALL patients with hyperuricemia when the drug was available. Laboratory and clinical TLS developed in 54.16% and 14.58% of patients with ALL, respectively. Laboratory and clinical TLS developed in 76.92% and 15.38% of patients with AML, respectively. No patient developed grade III to V TLS requiring dialysis. Thirteen patients (21.3%) had pulmonary leukostasis on admission, but recovered with CT and nasal oxygen. During the first 14 days of presentation, cerebral leukostasis\/coagulopathy-related early death (ED) was 4.2% and 7.7% in patients with ALL and AML, respectively, and all of these patients had a white blood cell count ≥400,000\/µL. There was also 1 infection-related death. Patients with hyperleukocytosis can be treated without LPh and liberal use of rasburicase. Renal failure is no longer a cause of ED. Intracranial hemorrhage is the main cause of ED, especially in patients already presenting with this complication. LPh may be performed in patients with leukostasis, if it is not possible to start induction CT early. When resources are limited, rasburicase should be administered in patients presenting with or developing hyperuricemia and\/or renal dysfunction.",

In this systematic review and meta-analysis, we searched MEDLINE and Embase for articles published between March 1, 2000 and April 4, 2021, without any language restrictions. We did a systematic review and meta-analysis of included clinical trials to evaluate the cardiovascular safety of febuxostat compared to allopurinol for treatment of chronic gout. Two reviewers independently selected studies, assessed study quality, and extracted data. Risk ratios were calculated with random effects and were reported with corresponding 95% confidence intervals (CI). From 240 potentially relevant citations, 224 papers were excluded; 16 studies were ultimately included in the analysis. Febuxostat had a better safety outcome compared with allopurinol，which was the composite of urgent coronary revascularization (OR: 0.84, 95% CI: 0.77-0.90, p < .0001) and stroke (OR: 0.87, 95% CI: 0.79-0.97, p = .009).

        "Published":"2021-04-12",
        "Abstract":"Introduction A systematic review and meta-analysis of the available randomized controlled trials (RCTs) were conducted to investigate the efficacy and safety of dotinurad in hyperuricemic patients with or without gout. Dotinurad is a novel selective urate reabsorption inhibitor (SURI) that increases uric acid excretion by selectively inhibiting urate transporter 1 (URAT1). To the best of our knowledge, this is the first meta-analysis conducted to gauge the efficacy and safety of dotinurad.  Methods Electronic databases (PubMed, the Cochrane Library, and ClinicalTrials.gov) were searched from inception till March 2, 2021, according to the Preferred Reporting Items for Systematic Review and Meta-Analysis statement. Randomized controlled trials comparing the efficacy and safety of dotinurad with placebo- or active (febuxostat or benzbromarone) control were included. The eligible studies were analyzed with RevMan 5.3 Software (The Nordic Cochrane Centre, Cochrane Collaboration, Copenhagen). Results Four eligible studies, consisting of 684 hyperuricemic patients were included. The number of patients who achieved serum uric acid (sUA) levels ≤ 6.0 mg\/dl favoured dotinurad 1 mg group as compared to placebo group (risk ratio {RR} = 39.27, 95% onfidence interval {CI}, 5.59 to 275.65; p = 0.0002), dotinurad 2 mg group compared with placebo group (RR = 45.36, 95% CI, 6.48 to 317.38; p= 0.0001), and dotinurad 4 mg group compared with placebo group (RR = 54.16, 95% CI, 7.76 to 377.77; p < 0.0001). Conversely, there was no significant difference in the number of patients who achieved the target sUA levels between dotinurad 2 mg and active control (RR = 1.00, 95% CI, 0.92 to 1.08; p = 0.91). Moreover, the percentage change in sUA levels from baseline to final visit favoured dotinurad 1 mg vs. placebo ((RR = 36.51, 95% CI, 33.00 to 40.02; p < 0.00001), dotinurad 2 mg vs. placebo (RR = 46.70, 95% CI, 42.53 to 50.87; p < 0.00001), and dotinurad 4 mg vs. placebo (RR = 63.84, 95% CI, 60.51 to 67.16; p < 0.00001), while no significant difference was seen in dotinurad 2 mg vs. active control (RR = -0.08, 95% CI, -4.27 to 4.11; p= 0.97). Compared with active or placebo control, dotinurad 2 mg showed no significant difference in the number of events of gouty arthritis (RR= 1.31, 95% CI, 0.47 to 3.71; p = 0.60), the number patients with adverse events (RR = 1.09, 95% CI, 0.91 to 1.30; p = 0.36), and the number of patients who experienced adverse drug reactions (RR = 1.00, 95% CI, 0.68 to 1.47; p = 0.99). Conclusion Dotinurad shows significant improvement in serum uric acid levels in hyperuricemic individuals with or without gout. Its urate-lowering effect is comparable to the commonly available anti-hyperuricemic agents. Moreover, it is effective at doses 1 mg, 2 mg, and 4 mg and well-tolerated at a dose of 2 mg.",

        "Abstract":"BACKGROUND: Uric acid (UA) is the end product of purine metabolism in the liver and is excreted by the kidneys. When purine metabolism is impaired, the serum UA level will be elevated (hyperuricemia) and eventually lead to gout. During evolution, humans and some primates have lost the gene encoding uricase, which is vital in UA metabolism. With the advances of human society, the prevalence of hyperuricemia has dramatically increased because of the refined food culture. Hyperuricemia can be controlled by drugs, such as allopurinol and probenecid. However, these drugs have no preventive effect and are associated with unpleasant side effects. An increasing number of probiotic strains, which are able to regulate host metabolism and prevent chronic diseases without harmful side effects, have been characterized. The identification of probiotic strains, which are able to exert beneficial effects on UA metabolism, will provide an alternative healthcare strategy for patients with hyperuricemia, especially for those who are allergic to anti-hyperuricemia drugs.\nMETHODS: To elicit hyperuricemia, rats in the symptom control group (HP) were injected with potassium oxonate and fed a high-purine diet. Rats in the probiotic groups received the high-purine diet, oxonate injection, and supplements of probiotic strains TSR332, TSF331, or La322. Rats in the blank control group (C) received a standard diet (AIN-93G) and oxonate injection.\nRESULTS: Purine-utilizing strains of probiotics were screened using high-pressure liquid chromatography (HPLC) in vitro, and the lowering effect on serum UA levels was analyzed in hyperuricemia rats in vivo. We found that  strain TSR332 and  strain TSF331 displayed significantly strong assimilation of inosine (90%;  = 0.00003 and 59%;  = 0.00545, respectively) and guanosine (78%;  = 0.00012 and 51%;  = 0.00062, respectively) within 30 min in vitro. Further animal studies revealed that serum UA levels were significantly reduced by 60% ( = 0.00169) and 30% ( = 0.00912), respectively, in hyperuricemic rats treated with TSR332 and TSF331 for 8 days. Remarkably, TSR332 ameliorated the occurrence of hyperuricemia, and no evident side effects were observed. Overall, our study indicates that TSR332 and TSF331 are potential functional probiotic strains for controlling the development of hyperuricemia.",

        "Abstract":"Excess fructose consumption contributes to development obesity, metabolic syndrome, and nonalcoholic fatty liver disease (NAFLD). Uric acid (UA), a metabolite of fructose metabolism, may have a direct role in development of NAFLD, with unclear mechanism. This study aimed to evaluate role of fructose and UA in NAFLD and explore mechanisms of allopurinol (Allo, a UA lowering medication) on NAFLD in Otsuka Long-Evans Tokushima Fatty (OLETF) rats fed a high fructose diet (HFrD), with Long-Evans Tokushima Otsuka (LETO) rats used as a control. There were six groups: LETO, LETO-Allo, OLETF, OLETF-Allo, OLETF-HFrD, and OLETF-HFrD-Allo. HFrD significantly increased body weight, epididymal fat weight, and serum concentrations of UA, cholesterol, triglyceride, HbA1c, hepatic enzymes, HOMA-IR, fasting insulin, and two hour-glucose after intraperitoneal glucose tolerance tests, as well as NAFLD activity score of liver, compared to the OLETF group. Allopurinol treatment significantly reduced hepatic steatosis, epididymal fat, serum UA, HOMA-IR, hepatic enzyme levels, and cholesterol in the OLETF-HFrD-Allo group. Additionally, allopurinol significantly downregulated expression of lipogenic genes, upregulated lipid oxidation genes, downregulated hepatic pro-inflammatory cytokine genes, and decreased ER-stress induced protein expression, in comparison with the OLETF-HFrD group. In conclusion, allopurinol ameliorates HFrD-induced hepatic steatosis through modulation of hepatic lipid metabolism, inflammation, and ER stress pathway. UA may have a direct role in development of fructose-induced hepatic steatosis, and allopurinol could be a candidate for prevention or treatment of NAFLD.",

        "Abstract":"BACKGROUND: Rasburicase can markedly and rapidly decrease uric acid (UA) levels, thereby preventing and treating tumor lysis syndrome. However, rasburicase is expensive, especially when used as per the manufacturer's recommended dosage of 0.2 mg\/kg\/day for up to 5 days. Numerous reports have shown that lower, and even single doses are effective in lowering UA levels but prospective randomized studies comparing low doses have not been performed.\nOBJECTIVES: To prospectively determine the efficacy and safety of two single low doses of rasburicase in adult patients (pts) with acute leukemia and elevated plasma UA.\nMETHODS: Eligible pts aged ≥ 18 years old with acute leukemia and UA ≥ 7.5 mg\/dL were randomized to receive an initial single dose of rasburicase 1.5 mg (Arm A) or 3 mg (Arm B) on day 1 in an unblinded fashion. All pts received allopurinol 300 mg daily on days 1-6.\nRESULTS: Twenty-four pts (median age 69 years; 14 males and 10 females) were enrolled in this phase 2 study (12 on each arm). Twenty pts had acute myeloid leukemia while 3 had acute lymphoblastic leukemia, and 1 had acute promyelocytic leukemia. Median initial UA level was 9.8 mg\/dL. Eighty-three percent of pts in both arms achieved UA < 7.5 mg\/dL by 24 h after therapy. Five pts (21 %; 2 from Arm A and 3 from Arm B) required additional doses of rasburicase. The majority (23\/24) of pts achieved UA goals after 1-2 doses of rasburicase. None had worsening renal function. Both doses were well tolerated, and no treatment related adverse events were reported.\nCONCLUSIONS: Single doses of rasburicase (as low as 1.5-3 mg) used in addition to allopurinol were well tolerated and highly efficacious (83 % response rate) in decreasing UA levels within 24 h of administration in adult acute leukemia pts with hyperuricemia.",

        "Abstract":"INTRODUCTION: Gout is an inflammatory disease triggered by deposition of urate crystals secondary to longstanding hyperuricemia, and its management implies both the treatment of flares and management of hyperuricemia. Dotinurad is a selective urate reabsorption inhibitor (SURI), potently inhibits urate transporter 1 in the apical surface of renal proximal tubular cells, and has been approved for the treatment of gout and hyperuricemia in Japan.\nAREAS COVERED: This overview of dotinurad covers nonclinical and clinical pharmacology studies in special populations and its efficacy and safety in Japanese hyperuricemic patients with and without gout.\nEXPERT OPINION: Dotinurad, as an SURI, is expected to inhibit urate reabsorption more effectively than conventional urate-lowering agents. It is noninferior to benzbromarone or febuxostat in reducing serum urate levels in hyperuricemic patients with or without gout. Its efficacy is not attenuated in patients with mild to moderate renal impairment or with hepatic impairment. At a maintenance dose of 2 or 4 mg once daily, most patients achieved the target serum urate level of ≤6 mg\/dL in a long-term study. No findings that raised safety concerns, including liver injury, were identified. Dotinurad is expected to be a new therapeutic option in hyperuricemic patients with and without gout.",

        "Abstract":"BACKGROUND: Patients with gout have an increased risk of urolithiasis and usually need urate-lowering therapy (ULT) for the prevention of disease progression. However, there is a paucity of clinical data regarding the risk of future urolithiasis in ULT users.\nMETHODS: This nested case-control study was performed using the Taiwan National Health Insurance Research Database. The aim of this study was to examine whether ULT (xanthine oxidase inhibitors [XOIs] or uricosuric agents) is associated with risk of future urolithiasis in patients with gout. Data were collected from January 2000 to December 2012.\nRESULTS: This study included 2307 case patients and 2307 matched controls. Case patients had gout that developed into urolithiasis, and control patients had gout but were not diagnosed with urolithiasis during the study period. Patients had a mean age of 56.3 years at diagnosis of gout, and 83.2% were male patients. No association was detected between use of XOIs or uricosuric agents and risk of future urolithiasis. Furthermore, there was no significant difference in the risk of future urolithiasis in patients exposed to various cumulative days of XOI or uricosuric prescriptions.\nCONCLUSION: The present study provides evidence that neither XOIs nor uricosuric agents are associated with risk of future urolithiasis in patients with gout. Before the availability of more clinical evidence, ensuring high fluid intake and prospective monitoring of urolithiasis development are still important for uricosuric agent users.",

        "Abstract":"['Objective:', 'Methods:', 'Results:', 'Conclusions:']\n['I', 'I', 'I', 'I', 'I']\n['2', '2', '2', '2', '2']\nThis study aimed to evaluate the potential association between uric acid (UA) lowering and cardiovascular risk reduction among UA-lowering therapies in adults.  A systematic search for randomized controlled trials (RCTs) was conducted according to the protocol pre-registered in PROSPERO (No. CRD42020199259). We search for RCTs in PubMed, Embase, Web of Science, the Cochrane Library, and ClinicalTrials.gov up to July 1, 2020. A meta-analysis was performed using a fixed- or random-effects model.  In total, 30 studies involving 18,585 hyperuricaemic patients were included. Xanthine oxidase inhibitor (XOI) therapy produced a 6.0% reduction in relative risk (RR) for major adverse cardiovascular events (MACEs). The use of febuxostat was associated with a higher risk of cardiovascular events (CVEs) (RR: 1.09, 95% CI 0.998-1.19,   = 0.0%), but the difference was not statistically significant. Allopurinol treatment was associated with a lower CVE risk (RR: 0.61, 95% CI 0.46-0.80,   = 21.0%). Among the UA-lowering therapies, the drug treatments were associated with all-cause mortality (RR: 1.20, 95% CI 1.02-1.41,   = 0.0%). The subgroup with a UA endpoint <7 mg\/dl was not associated with a higher CVE risk (RR: 0.57, 95% CI 0.35-0.92,   = 0.0%), and in the subgroup with a UA endpoint <5 mg\/dl group, a lower risk of CVEs was not observed (RR: 0.99, 95% CI 0.69-1.44,   = 0.0%).  UA reduction caused by XOIs reduced the incidence of MACEs. UA-lowering medicines were associated with changes in all-cause mortality but not cardiovascular outcomes. The lower UA endpoint was not associated with reduced cardiovascular risk.",

        "Abstract":"BACKGROUND: Allopurinol is a potent inhibitor of the enzyme xanthine oxidase used in the treatment of hyperuricemia and gout. Because it is well known that purines exert multiple affects on pain transmission, we hypothesized that the inhibition of xanthine oxidase by allopurinol could be a valid strategy to treat pain in humans. This study aimed to compare the analgesic efficacy of oral allopurinol versus placebo as an adjuvant therapy in patients displaying fibromyalgia.\nMETHODS: This randomized, double-blinded, placebo-controlled study included 60 women with the diagnosis of fibromyalgia. Patients were randomly assigned to receive either oral allopurinol 300 mg (n = 31) or placebo (n = 29) twice daily during 30 days. The patients were submitted to evaluation for pain sensitivity, anxiety, depression, and functional status before treatment, and 15 and 30 days thereafter.\nRESULTS: Oral administration of allopurinol 300 mg twice daily was ineffective in improving pain scores measured by several tools up to 30 days of treatment (P > 0.05). Additionally, no significant effects of allopurinol over anxiety, depressive symptoms, and functional status of fibromyalgia patients were observed in the present study.\nCONCLUSIONS: Although previous findings indicated that allopurinol could present intrinsic analgesic effects in both animals and humans, this study showed no benefit of the use of oral allopurinol as an adjuvant strategy during 30 days in women displaying fibromyalgia. However, considering previous promising results, new prospective studies are still valid to further investigate allopurinol and more selective purine derivatives in the management of pain syndromes.",

        "Abstract":"BACKGROUND: The aim of the present study was to formulate and characterize Nano- Structured Lipid Carriers (NLCs) of Febuxostat (FB) incorporated in the gel for the treatment of Gout. FB is a Xanthine Oxidase (XO) inhibitor drug used for chronic Gout and hyperuricemia. FB is a BCS class II drug, therefore, water solubility is very poor, and due to its poor solubility and wettability, it leads to poor dissolution. The hot high-pressure homogenization technique was used in this study to improve the physicochemical property of FB.\nMETHODS: The carbopol 934 was used to prepare NLCs gel of FB. The NLCs of FB was prepared in different drug: polymer ratios w\/w (2:1), (1:1), (1:2), (1:3) and (1:4) with solid lipid (Stearic Acid) and liquid lipid (Oleic acid). The preformulation study of FB included FTIR study melting point, standard calibration curves, and drug-polymer interaction study.\nRESULTS: The NLCs (1:3) showed high entrapment and drug content. The NLCs gel formulation was 87% released within 6 hours in a controlled manner.\nCONCLUSION: NLCs gel modifies the drug release, increases the bioavailability, and reduces side effects of FB. The prepared gel is the efficient formulation for the better treatment of chronic gout and hyperuricemia. The research findings have shown the undesirable side effects associated with the oral route that can be reduced by the use of NLCs formulation through the transdermal route in an effective manner.",

        "Abstract":"Plasma xanthine oxidoreductase (XOR) activity is high in metabolic disorders such as diabetic mellitus, obesity, or overweight. Thus, this study investigated whether the XOR inhibitor, topiroxostat, affected body weight. Male db\/db mice were fed standard diets with or without topiroxostat for 4 weeks. Body weight and food intake were constantly monitored, along with monitoring plasma biochemical markers, including insulin and XOR activity. Additionally, hepatic hypoxanthine and XOR activity were also documented. Single regression analysis was performed to determine the mechanism. Topiroxostat treatment suppressed weight gain relative to the vehicle without any impact on food intake. However, the weight of fat pads and hepatic and muscle triglyceride content did not change. Topiroxostat decreased the plasma uric acid and increased hepatic hypoxanthine in response to the inhibition of XOR activity. Plasma ketone body and free fatty acid were also increased. Moreover, fat weight was weakly associated with plasma XOR activity in the diabetic state and was negatively associated with ketone body by topiroxostat. These results suggested that topiroxostat amplified the burning of lipids and the salvage pathway, resulting in predisposing the body toward catabolism. The inhibition of plasma XOR activity may contribute to weight loss.",

        "Abstract":"Gout is a common and treatable disease caused by the deposition of monosodium urate crystals in articular and non-articular structures. Increased concentration of serum urate (hyperuricaemia) is the most important risk factor for the development of gout. Serum urate is regulated by urate transporters in the kidney and gut, particularly GLUT9 (SLC2A9), URAT1 (SLC22A12), and ABCG2. Activation of the NLRP3 inflammasome by monosodium urate crystals with release of IL-1β plays a major role in the initiation of the gout flare; aggregated neutrophil extracellular traps are important in the resolution phase. Although presenting as an intermittent flaring condition, gout is a chronic disease. Long-term urate lowering therapy (eg, allopurinol) leads to the dissolution of monosodium urate crystals, ultimately resulting in the prevention of gout flares and tophi and in improved quality of life. Strategies such as nurse-led care are effective in delivering high-quality gout care and lead to major improvements in patient outcomes.",

The elementary lesions, including tophus, double-contour (DC) sign, aggregates, synovitis and bone erosion of the bilateral knee, ankle and first metatarsophalangeal joints, were evaluated repeatedly by US before and after 3, 6 and 12 mo of treatment, and the effective rates of clearance of tophus, DC sign and aggregates in different time groups were compared. A Global OMERACT-EULAR Synovitis Score (GLOESS) was calculated for these three paired joints to observe the inflammation. Bone erosion was also scored. The correlation between serum uric acid levels and tophus size changes was analyzed. Our results indicated that the decrease in serum uric acid levels was not completely parallel to the decrease in tophus size. For tophus, there was no significant difference in the clearance rate between different time groups (χ = 1.76, p = 0.392), while for DC sign and aggregates, there were significant differences (χ = 21.48, p < 0.001, χ = 7.75, p = 0.018). Meanwhile, GLOESS was significantly lower after 6 mo of therapy (χ = 32.316, p < 0.001). Additionally, bone erosion had not improved after 1 y of treatment (Z = -1.633, p = 0.102).

All patients were assessed with tight controls at baseline, 1, 2, 3, 6, 9 and 12 months including clinical examination, information on demographics, lifestyle, self-efficacy and beliefs about medicines. The treatment target was sUA <360 µmol\/L and multivariable logistic regression was used to identify predictors of target attainment with ORs and 95% CIs.\nRESULTS: Of 211 patients (mean age 56.4 years, disease duration 7.8 years, 95% males), 186 completed the 12-month study. Mean sUA levels decreased from baseline mean 500 to 311 µmol\/L at 12 months with 85.5% achieving the treatment target. Alcohol consumption at least weekly versus less frequently (OR 0.14; 95% CI 0.04 to 0.55) as well as beliefs in overuse of medicines (OR per unit 0.77; 95 CI 0.62 to 0.94) decreased the chance of reaching the treatment target, while higher self-efficacy for arthritis symptoms (OR 1.49 per 10 units; 95% CI 1.09 to 2.05) increased the likelihood.\nCONCLUSIONS: This study shows that target sUA can be achieved with ULT in most patients. Less self-reported alcohol consumption, low beliefs in overuse of medicines and higher self-efficacy are associated with treatment success.",

Adults ages 18-40 years with baseline systolic BP ≥120 and <160 mm Hg or diastolic BP ≥80 and <100 mm Hg, and serum urate ≥5.0 mg\/dl for men or ≥4.0 mg\/dl for women were enrolled. Main exclusion criteria included chronic kidney disease, gout, or past use of urate-lowering therapies. Participants received oral allopurinol (300 mg daily) or placebo for 1 month followed by a 2-4 week washout and then were crossed over. Study outcome measures were change in systolic BP from baseline, endothelial function estimated as flow-mediated dilation (FMD), and high-sensitivity C-reactive protein (hsCRP) levels. Adverse events were assessed.\nRESULTS: Ninety-nine participants were randomized, and 82 completed all visits. The mean ± SD age was 28.0 ± 7.0 years, 62.6% were men, and 40.4% were African American. In the primary intent-to-treat analysis, systolic BP did not change during the allopurinol treatment phase (mean ± SEM -1.39 ± 1.16 mm Hg) or placebo treatment phase (-1.06 ± 1.08 mm Hg).

We hypothesized that UA has a different impact on clinical outcomes according to the underlying disease causing CKD.\nMETHODS: This study prospectively investigated the associations between UA and renal and non-renal outcomes according to the underlying disease causing CKD in 2,797 Japanese patients under the care of nephrologists. The patients were categorized into four groups: primary renal disease (n = 1306), hypertensive nephropathy (n = 467), diabetic nephropathy (n = 275), and other nephropathy (n = 749). The renal outcome was defined as end-stage renal disease (ESRD), and the non-renal outcome was defined as a composite endpoint of cardiovascular events (CVEs) and all-cause mortality.\nRESULTS: During a median 4.8-year follow-up, 359 (12.8%) patients reached the renal outcome, and 260 (9.3%) reached the non-renal outcome. In the all-patient analysis, hyperuricemia was not associated with the risks for renal and non-renal outcomes, but in primary renal disease (PRD) and hypertensive renal disease (HTN) patients, hyperuricemia was significantly associated with non-renal outcomes. Per 1 mg\/dl higher UA level, multivariable adjusted hazard ratio was 1.248 (95% CI: 1.003 to 1.553) for PRD, and 1.250 (1.035 to 1.510) for HTN. Allopurinol did not reduce the risks for renal and non-renal outcomes, both in all patients and in the subgroup analysis.\nCONCLUSIONS: The effect of hyperuricemia on clinical outcomes in CKD patients varies according to the underlying disease causing CKD. Hyperuricemia is an independent risk factor for non-renal outcomes in primary renal disease and hypertensive renal disease patients.

        "Abstract":"Verinurad, a uric acid transporter 1 (URAT1) inhibitor, lowers serum uric acid by promoting its urinary excretion. Co-administration with a xanthine oxidase inhibitor (XOI) to simultaneously reduce uric acid production rate reduces the potential for renal tubular precipitation of uric acid, which can lead to acute kidney injury. The combination is currently in development for chronic kidney disease and heart failure. The aim of this work was to apply and extend a previously developed semi-mechanistic exposure-response model for uric acid kinetics to include between-subject variability to verinurad and its combinations with XOIs, and to provide predictions to support future treatment strategies. The model was developed using data from 12 clinical studies from a total of 434 individuals, including healthy volunteers, patients with hyperuricemia, and renally impaired subjects. The model described the data well, taking into account the impact of various patient characteristics such as renal function, baseline fractional excretion of uric acid, and race. The potencies (EC50s) of verinurad (reducing uric acid reuptake), febuxostat (reducing uric acid production), and oxypurinol (reducing uric acid production) were: 29, 128, and 13,030 ng\/mL, respectively. For verinurad, symptomatic hyperuricemic (gout) subjects showed a higher EC50 compared with healthy volunteers (37 ng\/mL versus 29 ng\/mL); while no significant difference was found for asymptomatic hyperuricemic patients. Simulations based on the uric acid model were performed to assess dose-response of verinurad in combination with XOI, and to investigate the impact of covariates. The simulations demonstrated application of the model to support dose selection for verinurad.",

Common causes of hyperuricemia, in addition to hereditary reduced renal excretion of urate, include purine over-nutrition, aging, comorbidities and associated medications, some of which increase serum urate levels. The first gout flare represents the signal for deposited urate crystals. If hyperuricemia remains untreated, crystal deposition proceeds and can cause recurrent gout flares, joint destruction and tophi. There is evidence that silent inflammation is ongoing even during asymptomatic stages. Gout patients often exhibit other metabolic, renal and cardiovascular co-morbidities and have higher (cardiovascular) mortality. Therefore, guidelines call for consequent urate lowering strategies to bring serum urate levels to a target at least below 360 µmol\/l.

Group C was administered allopurinol (5 mg\/kg body weight) intraperitoneally, and Group D, E, and F were given berberine in doses of 0.75 mg\/kg, 1.25 mg\/kg, and 2.5 mg\/kg body weight respectively intraperitoneally for seven consecutive days, one hour after the potassium oxonate injection. On zero, first, third, and seventh day of the experiment, blood and urine samples were taken to estimate the serum and urinary uric acid levels. On days zero and 7, serum uric acid was measured by cardiac puncture, while on days 1 and 3, it was measured by the tail prick method. The uric acid was measured by an enzymatic colorimetric method and creatinine by the Jaffe method. Fractional excretion of urate was also calculated. Results Berberine lowered serum uric acid levels in rats with potassium oxonate-induced hyperuricemia with highly significant results (p-value <0.001) in all three dosages. Berberine increased the urinary uric acid level and the fractional excretion of urate in a time-dependent manner in all three dosages. This effect was maximally shown by low dose berberine with a highly significant result (p-value <0.001). Conclusion Berberine successfully decreased the serum uric acid level of hyperuricemic rats by increasing the urinary uric acid level and fractional excretion of urate.",

Subjects whose serum uric acid (sUA) levels were ≥480 µmol\/l with gout, ≥480 µmol\/l without gout but with comorbidities, or ≥540 µmol\/l were enrolled. Subjects were randomly assigned (1:1:1:1:1) to receive once daily 2.5 mg, 5 mg, 10 mg of SHR4640, 50 mg of benzbromarone or placebo, respectively. The primary end point was the proportion of subjects who achieved target sUA level of ≤360 µmol\/l at week 5.\nRESULTS: 99.5% of subjects (n = 197) were male and 95.9% of subjects had gout history. The proportions of subjects who achieved target sUA at week 5 were 32.5%, 72.5% and 61.5% in the 5 mg, 10 mg SHR4640 and benzbromarone groups, respectively, significantly higher than the placebo group (0%; P < 0.05 for 5 mg and 10 mg SHR4640 group). The sUA was reduced by 32.7%, 46.8% and 41.8% at week 5 with 5 mg, 10 mg SHR4640 and benzbromarone, respectively, vs placebo (5.9%; P < 0.001 for each comparison). The incidences of gout flares requiring intervention were similar among all groups. Occurrences of treatment-emergent adverse events (TEAEs) were comparable across all groups, and serious TEAEs were not reported.\nCONCLUSIONS: The present study indicated a superior sUA-lowering effect and well tolerated safety profile after 5-week treatment with once-daily 5 mg\/10 mg of SHR4640 as compared with placebo in Chinese subjects with hyperuricaemia.\nTRIAL REGISTRATION: ClinicalTrials.gov number, NCT03185793.",

Hyperuricemia, the laboratory abnormality associated with the development of gout, also occurs in a significant number of patients with chronic kidney disease (CKD), a condition that affects approximately 14% of the US population. Several recent studies have attempted to provide a definitive link between the presence of hyperuricemia and progression of CKD; however, the treatment of asymptomatic hyperuricemia in CKD is not supported by recent randomized controlled trials. The pharmacology of acute gout flares and urate lowering is complicated in patients who also have evidence of CKD, primarily because of an increased risk of medication toxicity. Recipients of kidney transplants are particularly at risk of debilitating gout and medication toxicity. We review the available data linking CKD, gout, and hyperuricemia, providing practice guidelines on managing gout in CKD patients and kidney transplant recipients. We advocate for much greater involvement of nephrologists in the management of gout in renal patients.",

        "Abstract":"OBJECTIVE: The treatment of gout with allopurinol is effective at reducing urate levels and the frequency of flares. Several observational studies have shown important reductions in mortality with allopurinol use, with wide variations in results. We undertook this review to assess the extent of bias in these studies, particularly time-related biases such as immortal time bias.\nMETHODS: We searched the literature to identify all observational studies describing the effect of allopurinol use versus nonuse on all-cause mortality.\nRESULTS: We identified 12 observational studies, of which 3 were affected by immortal time bias and 3 by immeasurable time bias, while the remaining 6 studies avoided these time-related biases. Reductions in all-cause mortality with allopurinol use were observed among the studies with immortal time bias, with a pooled hazard ratio (HR) of death associated with allopurinol of 0.71 (95% confidence interval [95% CI] 0.50-1.01), as well as in those with immeasurable time bias (pooled HR 0.62 [95% CI 0.56-0.67]). The 6 studies that avoided these biases demonstrated a null effect of allopurinol on mortality (pooled HR 0.99 [95% CI 0.87-1.11]), though the lack of an analysis based on treatment adherence may have attenuated the effect.\nCONCLUSION: Observational studies are important to provide real-world data on medication effects. The observational studies showing significantly decreased mortality with allopurinol treatment cannot be used as evidence, however, mainly due to time-related biases that tend to greatly exaggerate the potential benefit of treatments. The ALL-HEART randomized trial, which is currently underway and evaluates the effect of adding allopurinol to usual care (compared to no added treatment), will provide reliable evidence on mortality.",

        "Abstract":"OBJECTIVE: Management of hyperuricemia is crucial to controlling tumor lysis syndrome (TLS) during cancer therapy. Urate oxidase (UOX) that catalyzes the enzymatic oxidation of uric acid into allantoin, is effective in lowering plasma uric acid levels and controlling hyperuricemia. Recently, we developed a new recombinant conjugate variant of UOX therapeutic drug using PASylation technology. This study was designed to evaluate the stability, plasma half-life and immunogencity of PASylated UOX.\nMETHODS: A recombinant variant of PASylated UOX from the Aspergillus flavus was manufactured using bioinformatics and experimental techniques. Ex vivo evaluation of stability of PASylated UOX was done in 50% human serum. For half-life test, recombinant PASylated UOX and rasburicase were administered at 1.5 mg\/kg to 10 rats in two different groups and samples were collected after injection Production of antibodies against PASylated drug was also assayed.\nRESULTS: Residual activity of PASylated UOX in 50% human serum was higher than rasburicase and native UOX. Stability of PASylated UOX at 25°C and 37°C was also higher than rasburicase and native UOX. The PASylated half-life was ~32.1 hours, whereas half-life for rasburicase and native UOX was ~25.1 and ~22.8 hours, respectively. In immunogenicity examination, there is 33% and 36% decrease in the absorbance of native UOX and rasburicase, respectively when compared with that of PASylated UOX.\nCONCLUSION: Our data confirmed the efficacy and stability of PASylated UOX in comparison to the rasburicase. In summary, the results indicated that PASylated UOX drug is effective at lowering plasma uric acid levels with prolonged plasma half-life and decreased cost.<br \/>.",

He was hospitalized due to fever, malaise, and respiratory symptoms. A diagnosis of RSV upper respiratory tract infection complicated by secondary pneumonia was made, and oral ribavirin (600 mg in 3 divided doses daily) and intravenous levofloxacin (750 mg once daily) were initiated. On day 2 of the hospital admission, the patient's uric acid levels had increased from a baseline of 4 to 6 mg\/dL to 19.3 and 22.2 mg\/dL after the fourth and fifth doses of ribavirin, respectively, and his serum creatinine steadily had increased from a baseline of 0.7 to 0.8 mg\/dL to 1.6 mg\/dL. Ribavirin was discontinued after the sixth dose, and a single dose of intravenous rasburicase (7.5 mg) was administered. On day 3, the patient's serum uric and creatinine concentrations had decreased to 4.7 mg\/dL and 1.1 mg\/dL, respectively. He continued to recover on antibiotics and was discharged with normal uric acid and serum creatinine levels.\nCONCLUSION: We report a case of severe hyperuricemia and acute kidney injury that developed early after initiation of ribavirin for RSV infection and suspected bacterial pneumonia in an immunocompromised patient without hepatitis C, requiring ribavirin discontinuation and rasburicase administration. To our knowledge, this is the first reported case of severe hyperuricemia in a patient treated with ribavirin for RSV infection rather than chronic hepatitis C. Clinicians should be aware of the possibility of acute and severe hyperuricemia following ribavirin administration.",

        "Abstract":"INTRODUCTION: Pegloticase is a recombinant PEGylated uricase that converts relatively insoluble urate to highly water-soluble allantoin, which is readily excreted by the kidneys. It is the first and only biologic treatment indicated for refractory or uncontrolled gout. Clinical trials showed a 6-month pegloticase responder rate of 42%, with the non-responder rate largely being attributed to the development of high-titer anti-drug antibodies (ADAs) against pegloticase. Immunomodulation attenuates ADA formation to biologics in a number of autoimmune conditions, but their use with pegloticase for uncontrolled gout is less established. This systematic review examined published cases of refractory gout patients treated with immunomodulation in combination with pegloticase.\nMETHODS: Published cases of immunomodulation with pegloticase were identified in a PubMed search and in abstract databases of major rheumatology society meetings (2012-2020). Duplicate and review articles were excluded, as were those that did not include cases of pegloticase use with immunomodulation. Cases with off-label pegloticase administration schedules were also excluded. Pegloticase response was defined according to each study's specified standard.\nRESULTS: Ten publications describing 82 cases of pegloticase use in the setting of immunomodulation were identified. Overall pegloticase response rate was 82.9%. Patients co-treated with an individual immunomodulator had the following response rates: methotrexate: 87.5% (35 of 40 patients), mycophenolate mofetil: 86.4% (19 of 22 patients vs. pegloticase monotherapy [placebo]: 40% [4 of 10 patients]), azathioprine: 63.6% (7 of 11 patients), and leflunomide: 66.7% (4 of 6 patients). A single patient was co-treated with cyclosporin and was a responder. The two patients treated with more than one immunomodulator were both responders.\nCONCLUSION: Published reports suggest that immunomodulation co-therapy has the potential to markedly improve pegloticase responder rates in patients with uncontrolled gout.",

We analyzed plasma samples collected at baseline and 24 weeks in the Xanthine Oxidase Inhibition for Hyperuricemic Heart Failure Patients (EXACT-HF) study, which randomized patients with heart failure with reduced ejection fraction to allopurinol or placebo. Associations between plasma levels of SAM, SAH, SAM\/SAH ratio, and outcomes, including laboratory markers and clinical events, were assessed. Despite randomization, median SAM levels were significantly lower at baseline in the allopurinol group. SAH levels at 24 weeks, and change in SAM from baseline to week 24, were significantly higher in the group of patients randomized to allopurinol compared to the placebo group. A significant correlation was observed between change in SAH levels and change in plasma uric acid (baseline to 24-week changes) in the allopurinol group. There were no significant associations between levels of SAM, SAH, and SAM\/SAH ratio and clinical outcomes. Our results demonstrate significant biological variability in SAM and SAH levels at baseline and during treatment with an anti-oxidant and suggest a potential mechanism for the lack of efficacy observed in trials of anti-oxidant therapy.

        "Abstract":"Hyperuricemia is associated with insulin resistance, pancreatic β-cell dysfunction and consequently with development of type 2 diabetes. Although a direct relationship between high levels of uric acid (UA) and the development of diabetes is still a controversial issue, there is some evidence that strongly points to pancreatic β-cells damage as a result of high serum UA levels. Here, the mechanisms underlying UA-induced β-cell damage are discussed. Available literature indicates that UA can decrease glucose-stimulated insulin secretion and cause β-cell death. The mechanisms underlying these effects are UA-induced oxidative stress and inflammation within the β-cells. UA also stimulates inducible nitric oxide (NO) synthase (iNOS) gene expression leading to NO-induced β-cell dysfunction. Thus hyperuricemia may potentially cause β-cell dysfunction, leading to diabetes. It may be hypothesized that in hyperuricemic subjects, UA-lowering drugs may be beneficial in preventing diabetes.",

XOR also enhances the production of reactive oxygen species and causes endothelial dysfunction. In this study, we evaluated the association of XOR and its substrate with the vascular complications in 94 Japanese inpatients with type 2 diabetes (T2DM). The plasma XOR activity and plasma xanthine levels were positively correlated with the body mass index, aspartate aminotransferase (AST), alanine aminotransferase (ALT), γ-GTP, fasting plasma insulin, and the homeostasis model of assessment of insulin resistance (HOMA-IR), and negatively correlated with the high density lipoprotein cholesterol. The plasma XOR activity also showed a positive correlation with the serum triglyceride. Multivariate analyses identified AST, ALT, fasting plasma insulin and HOMA-IR as being independently associated with the plasma XOR activity. The plasma XOR activity negatively correlated with the duration of diabetes, and positively correlated with the coefficient of variation of the R-R interval and sensory nerve conduction velocity. Furthermore, the plasma XOR activity was significantly decreased in patients with coronary artery disease. Thus, the plasma XOR activity might be a surrogate marker for the development of vascular complications, as well as liver dysfunction and insulin resistance, in T2DM.Trial registration: This study is registered at the UMIN Clinical Trials Registry (UMIN000029970; https:\/\/www.umin.ac.jp\/ctr\/index-j.htm ).

        "Abstract":"OBJECTIVES: The objective was to identify the comorbidities of gout, to compare gender difference and independent factors of frequent gout attacks (> 20 times).\nMETHOD: Demographic, clinical variables, self-reported comorbidities, and biochemical variables (i.e., initial serum uric acid (UA) and UA at visit) were collected in this cross-sectional study. Gout attack times were recorded as ≤ 5, 6-10, 11-20, and > 20. Adjusted odds ratio (OR) and corresponding 95% confidence interval (CI) were calculated to explore the association between selected risk factors and frequent gout attacks.\nRESULTS: Six hundred fifty-three gout patients with a mean age of 48.3 ± 15.8 years were included, 84.7% of whom were males. The median gout duration was 6.0 (3.0-12.0) years. The most common comorbidities involved hypertension (166, 25.4%), coronary artery disease (CAD) (67, 10.3%), chronic kidney disease (66, 10.1%), and hyperlipidemia (57, 8.7%). Abnormalities including nephrolithiasis (29.4%), hydronephrosis (3.2%), and gallstones (11.9%) were also found. Although female patients had a longer disease duration and more CAD, they had a lower level of UA, creatine, and C-reactive protein (CRP) but higher high-density lipoprotein cholesterol (HDL-C) (p < 0.05). A positive correlation between UA and triglycerides was found in females (p = 0.039). Patients with renal insufficiency or nephrolithiasis had longer disease duration and more gout attacks (p < 0.001). In multivariable regression analysis, only gout duration (OR = 7.89, p < 0.001) and UA (OR = 1.48, p < 0.001) was independent factors of frequent gout attacks.\nCONCLUSIONS: Comorbidity screening involving dyslipidemia is often neglected in gout patients. Gout duration and UA are the risk factors of frequent gout attacks. Key Points • Comorbidities can be overlooked if the screening for lipid levels, cardiovascular disease, and kidney disease is not completed. • There are differences in comorbidities and biochemical findings between male and female patients with gout. • Gout duration and serum uric acid level are independent risk factors of frequent gout attacks.",

Enzymatic assay revealed that the recombinant urate oxidases expressed in HL-7702 cells were functionally active. Electron microscopy study showed that the recombinant enzymes were localized to peroxisome and formed distinct crystalloid core structures as in other mammal cells. Although similar rate of uric acid degradation was observed for all recombinant urate oxidases, HL-7702-pLVX-UOX cells and HL-7702-pLVX-UOX cells retained more cell viability compared with HL-7702-pLVX-UOX at high uric acid level. This study provides a new direction for the treatment of gout and hyperuricemia.",

During our study, 130 men (mean age 55.5 ± 9.4 years) with gout (duration 7.7 ± 7.1 years) were examined. All patients were divided into two treatment groups. The main group (n = 68) was taking allopurinol at 300 mg per day dose and additionally a synbiotic. The comparison group (n = 62) received allopurinol monotherapy without synbiotic intake. The therapy duration was 3 months. Evaluation of therapy efficiency was marked by blood uric acid changes, cytokine levels, CRP and fecal microbiota condition. After treatment, stabilization of the gut microbiota parameters was observed, which was leading to normalization uricemia levels (40.3% vs. 21%, p <0.01) in the main group patients. Addition of synbiotic to allopurinol leads to a blood uric acid lowering (18.7% vs. 13.3%, p <0.01), CRP reduction (75% vs. 26.3%, p <0.01) as well as decrease of cytokines level: IL-1β, IL-6, IL-8, IL-10 and TNFα (all p <0.001). After a 3-month gout treatment, a group of patients who received complex therapy with synbiotic inclusion showed signs of disease remission characterized by inflammation activity reducing, fecal microbiota condition normalization and a more pronounced decrease in laboratory markers comparing to control group.",

        "Abstract":"BACKGROUND: Various optimal medical therapies have been established to treat heart failure (HF) with reduced ejection fraction (HFrEF). Both HFrEF and HF with preserved ejection fraction (HFpEF) are associated with poor outcomes. We investigated the effect of topiroxostat, an oral xanthine oxidoreductase inhibitor, for HFpEF patients with hyperuricemia or gout.\nMETHODS: In this nonrandomized, open-label, single-arm trial, we administered topiroxostat 40-160 mg\/day to HFpEF patients with hyperuricemia or gout to achieve a target uric acid level of 6.0 mg\/dL. The primary outcome was rate of change in log-transformed brain natriuretic peptide (BNP) level from baseline to 24 weeks after topiroxostat treatment. The secondary outcomes included amount of change in BNP level, uric acid evaluation values, and oxidative stress marker levels after 24 weeks of topiroxostat treatment. Thirty-six patients were enrolled; three were excluded before study initiation.\nRESULTS: Change in log-transformed BNP level was -3.4 ± 8.9% (p = 0.043) after 24 weeks of topiroxostat treatment. The rate of change for the decrease in BNP level was -18.0 (-57.7, 4.0 pg\/mL; p = 0.041). Levels of uric acid and 8-hydroxy-2'-deoxyguanosine\/creatinine, an oxidative stress marker, also significantly decreased (-2.8 ± 1.6 mg\/dL, p < 0.001, and -2.3 ± 3.7 ng\/mgCr, p = 0.009, respectively).\nCONCLUSIONS: BNP level was significantly lower in HFpEF patients with hyperuricemia or gout after topiroxostat administration; however, the rate of decrease was low.

Therefore, our aim is to investigate the possible associations between hyperuricaemia, gout, prescription of allopurinol and renal outcomes in patients with CKD.\nMETHODS: The retrospective cohort study involved 1123 Royal Brisbane and Women's Hospital (RBWH) patients, enrolled in the CKD.QLD registry from May 2011 to August 2017. Patients were divided into two uric acid categories, with uric acid ≤ 0.36 mmol\/L and > 0.36 mmol\/L. Association of delta estimated glomerular filtration rate (eGFR) with gout, allopurinol treatment and hyperuricaemia were analysed.\nRESULTS: Patients with an entry urate > 0.36 mmol\/L were older, had higher body mass index (BMI) and worse baseline kidney function. Proportion of patients with gout, hyperuricaemia and allopurinol treatment increased with advanced CKD stages. Age-adjusted analysis revealed a significant association between serum urate level and delta eGFR, with no significant association between gout, treatment with allopurinol and delta eGFR. Furthermore, neither gout nor the prescription of allopurinol had a significant effect on the time to renal death (composite end point of kidney replacement therapy or death).\nCONCLUSION: Hyperuricaemia seemed to be independently associated with faster CKD progression or renal death. This was not observed with gout or prescription of allopurinol. Furthermore, allopurinol was not associated with decreased incidence of cardiovascular events. These data suggest that hyperuricaemia is likely the effect and not the cause of CKD or CKD progression.",

Responders had persistent urate lowering (<6mg\/dL) whereas, non-responders had transient urate lowering during the 6-month RCTs. Gout flares (self-reported) were defined as acute joint pain and swelling requiring treatment. Gout flare prophylaxis (colchicine, 0.6 mg once or twice daily, or a non-steroidal anti-inflammatory drug) was initiated 1 week before the first infusion and continued throughout the study. Plasma urate at the time of flare and the change in urate preceding a flare were analysed.\nRESULTS: Mean flare rates increased with pegloticase versus placebo during the first 3 months followed by marked reductions during months 4-6. The increase in flares with pegloticase during the first 3 months was most evident (p=0.0006) and the decrease during the second 3 months was least marked (p=0.0006) in subjects receiving monthly pegloticase. Fluctuation in urate levels was highest in monthly responders (p=0.002) and was associated with flare occurrence. Multivariate linear regression analysis indicated the only variables significantly associated with flares were treatment group and absolute change in plasma urate before flares.\nCONCLUSIONS: Pegloticase treatment increased flares during the first 3 months of treatment in all groups when plasma urate was significantly lowered and was followed by a decline in months 4-6 in patients maintaining a low plasma urate.

However, fewer studies have investigated how CoTOL impacts the intestinal flora in reducing uric acid. In the present, we analyze the bacteria targeted by ingredients of CoTOL and evaluate the effects of CoTOL on uric acid and intestinal flora in a mice model of obese hyperuricemia inoculated with xanthine dehydrogenase- (XOD-) producing bacteria, . Firstly, ingredients of herbs in CoTOL and gene target by these ingredients were retrieved from TCMID 2.0, and these genes were screened by DAVID Bioinformatics Resources 6.8, deciphered to retrieve the bacteria. Then, 3-4-week-old male C57bl\/6j mice were randomly divided into 6 groups and fed with high fat diet for 8 weeks up to obesity standard. The mice were inoculated intragastrically with 5 × 10 CFU  3 times at the 5, 6, and 7 week and intragastrically administrated with uricase inhibitor, potassium-oxonate (PO, 250 mg\/kg), to induce hyperuricemia at the 8 week, once a day for 7 consecutive days, respectively (IB model). IB model plus CoTOL (0.4 ml\/20g) and allopurinol (40 mg\/kg) were administrated by gavage at the 5 week, once a day for 4 weeks. The feces and blood in each group were sampled at the 4 and 8 week. With no bacteria inoculation, CoTOL, allopurinol, and blank group were treated with CoTOL and allopurinol or water, respectively. 44 species of bacteria (i.e.,  etc.) genes were targeted by 6 ingredients of 6 herbs in CoTOL. Inoculation with  significantly caused the elevation of uric acid and the change of intestinal flora structure, whereas treatment with CoTOL signiﬁcantly increased the abundance of  and those of  and  decreased. Furthermore, CoTOL exhibited a unique effect on reducing weight unobserved in allopurinol intervention. The present study, for the first time, demonstrated that CoTOL has beneficial effects on hyperuricemia and overweight, which may be attributed to regulating material metabolism and improving the structure or function of intestinal flora. Thus, CoTOL may be a promising therapy for hyperuricemia and overweight in chronic gout management and can be integrated with conventional treatments.",

This study aimed to assess whether febuxostat and allopurinol could differently influence carotid-femoral pulse wave velocity (cfPWV) in patients with gout and elevated serum uric acid (SUA) levels.\nMETHODS AND RESULTS: A multi-centre, multinational, phase IV, randomized, parallel-group, active-controlled, open-label trial with blind endpoints evaluation. One hundred and ninety-seven adults with gout and SUA levels ≥8 mg\/dL were randomized to febuxostat or allopurinol in a 1:1 ratio for 36 weeks. The primary outcome was the comparison of the effects of febuxostat and allopurinol on changes in cfPWV.

We discuss the prescribing of drugs for the treatment of gout in patients with CKD.\nRECENT FINDINGS: There is a lack of consensus from expert guidelines, and prescribers have concerns regarding the risk of adverse reactions from medicines used to treat gout. These situations appear to contribute to suboptimal management of gout in this cohort. Recent data have challenged the role of urate lowering therapy (ULT) in the management of asymptomatic hyperuricemia in CKD.\nSUMMARY: ULT should be commenced in all patients with severe, recurrent disease, tophaceous gout and evidence of joint damage. Most international guidelines recommend a treat-to-target approach for the management of gout. In CKD, ULT should be started at low dose with up titration adjusted to serum urate levels, rather than being based on the creatinine clearance. If patients fail first-line therapy, alternative agents are utilized, the specific agent depending on ease of access, burden of disease and other comorbidities. This approach should be incorporated into routine practice to ensure optimal treatment of gout in CKD.

        "Abstract":"The increasing incidence of gout poses a very challenging management problem. However, the currently available drugs often have various toxic side effects. As a traditional edible and medicinal macrofungus, Sanghuangporus vaninii presents high medical research value. Therefore, to improve fermentation efficiency and identify novel anti-gout drugs, we optimized the culture medium of S. vaninii with lignin and further investigated its anti-gout effects. The results indicated that 0.06 g\/L of lignin was most favorable for S. vaninii growth. In the hyperuricemia cell model, we found that S. vaninii could significantly induce the downregulation of xanthine oxidoreductase and the upregulation of hypoxanthine-guanine phosphoribosyltransferase. Furthermore, following oral administration of the extracts, the serum uric acid levels of mice with hyperuricemia were effectively reduced. In a gouty arthritis rat model, S. vaninii also achieved strong suppression of synovial swelling, indicating its anti-inflammatory activity. In addition, the antioxidant assays suggested that S. vaninii shows a strong free radical scavenging capacity and can effectively alleviate cellular oxidative stress. This activity further enhances its anti-inflammatory activity and reduces the incidence of comorbidities. In summary, our results provide the basis for the utilization of S. vaninii to develop anti-gout drugs.",

        "Published":"2020-09-16",
        "Abstract":"Hyperuricaemia is frequent in chronic kidney disease (CKD). Observational studies have shown an association with adverse outcomes and acquired hyperuricaemia (meaning serum urate levels as low as 1.0 mg\/dL) in animal models induces kidney injury. This evidence does not justify the widespread use of urate-lowering drugs for asymptomatic hyperuricaemia in CKD. However, promising results from small, open-label studies led some physicians to prescribe urate-lowering drugs to slow CKD progression. Two recent, large, placebo-controlled trials (CKD-FIX and PERL) showed no benefit from urate lowering with allopurinol on the primary endpoint of CKD progression, confirming prior negative results. Despite these negative findings, it was still argued that the study population could be optimized by enrolling younger non-proteinuric CKD patients with better preserved glomerular filtration rate (GFR). However, in these low-risk patients, GFR may be stable under placebo conditions. Additionally, the increased mortality trends already identified in gout trials of urate-lowering therapy were also observed in CKD-FIX and PERL, sending a strong safety signal: 21\/449 (4.7%) and 10\/444 (2.2%) patients died in the combined allopurinol and placebo groups, respectively [chi-squared P-value 0.048; relative risk 2.07 (95% CI 0.98-4.34); P = 0.06]. Given the absent evidence of benefit in multiple clinical trials and the potentially serious safety issues, the clear message should be that urate-lowering therapy should not be prescribed for the indication of slowing CKD progression. Additionally, regulatory agencies should urgently reassess the safety of chronic prescription of urate-lowering drugs for any indication.",

Among these,  showed the most potent inhibitory activity with a half-maximal inhibitory concentration (IC) value of 6.3 µM, similar to that of allopurinol (IC = 5.7 µM) and better than that of oxypurinol (IC = 43.1 µM), which are XO inhibitors. A comparative activity screen indicated that the acetyl group at C3 and C3' is crucial for XO inhibition. For example,  showed nearly 4-fold higher efficacy than  (IC = 20.9 µM). Representative inhibitors (-) in the rhizomes of  showed reversible and noncompetitive inhibition toward XO.

        "Abstract":"AIM: To evaluate a 12-week course of combined alloturinol-lowering therapy with a prophylactic anti-inflammatory dose of movalis for the frequency of exacerbations and the quality of life of patients with gout.\nMATERIALS AND METHODS: Allopurinol was administered orally, 1 time per day. Every 3 weeks, the dosage of the drug was increased by 50 mg to 300 mg per day under the control of the level of serum uric acid (sUA). The total daily dose of the drug movalis, used in the form of different dosage forms, was 7.515 mg. The clinical effectiveness of the treatment was evaluated after 3, 6, 9 and 12 weeks according to physical examination, the dynamics of joint pain at rest, during movement and palpation, according to the visual analogue scale (VAS) in millimeters, Likert scale, EuroQol-5D-5L questionnaire, care for oneself, habitual daily activities, the presence of anxiety and depression, assessment of satisfaction with treatment (on a scale of 1 to 5, where 1 is the complete absence of improvement or worsening, and 5 is a very good result); took into account the period of remission, as well as the time before the onset of relapse of gouty arthritis. An adverse event (AE) was recorded.\nRESULTS AND DISCUSSION: On the background of treatment with movalis 7.5 mg per day more than two-thirds of patients showed no worsening of the articular syndrome with an increase in the dose of allopurinol to 300 mg per day. By the 12th week of observation, a significant difference was found between the severity of gouty arthritis characteristics in the direction of improving mobility, self-care, normal daily activities, reducing soreness, reducing anxiety and depression (p0.05). In addition, the ESR and sUA levels were significantly different initially and at the final observation point (p0.05), which indicates a positive effect on the inflammatory process. A 3-month course of combination therapy was not accompanied by significant increases in blood pressure, changes in creatinine clearance in blood serum. There were no adverse events from the gastrointestinal tract. 90.9% of patients rated the treatment result as very good. AE in the form of a skin allergic rash was observed in one patient; it did not require interruption of treatment and completely stopped without consequences after completion of the course.\nCONCLUSION: 12 a week-long combined therapy of the allopurinol-reducing drug with the anti-inflammatory dose movalis prevents the exacerbation of the articular syndrome and improves the quality of life of patients with gout.",

        "Abstract":"rd\nSerum uric acid (UA) is taken up by endothelial cells and reduces the level of nitric oxide (NO) by inhibiting its production and accelerating its degradation. Cytosolic and plasma xanthine oxidase (XO) generates superoxide and also decreases the NO level. Thus, hyperuricemia is associated with impaired endothelial function. Hyperuricemia is often associated with vascular diseases such as chronic kidney disease (CKD) and cardiovascular disease (CVD). It has long been debated whether hyperuricemia is causally related to the development of these diseases. The 2020 American College of Rheumatology Guideline for the Management of Gout (ACR2020) does not recommend pharmacological treatment of hyperuricemia in patients with CKD\/CVD. In contrast, the Japanese Guideline on Management of Hyperuricemia and Gout (JGMHG), 3edition, recommends pharmacological treatment of hyperuricemia in patients with CKD. In a FREED study on Japanese hyperuricemic patients with CVD, an XO inhibitor, febuxostat, improved the primary composite endpoint of cerebro-cardio-renovascular events, providing a rationale for the use of urate-lowering agents (ULAs). Since a CARES study on American gout patients with CVD treated with febuxostat revealed increased mortality, ACR2020 recommends switching to different ULAs. However, there was no difference in the mortality of Japanese patients between the febuxostat-treated group and the placebo or allopurinol-treated groups in either the FEATHER or FREED studies.",

        "Abstract":"PURPOSE OF REVIEW: Although gout is a common, well-recognized, and extensively researched rheumatologic disease, it continues to be underappreciated and undertreated. Although the prevalence of gout has been rising over the past several decades, adherence to urate lowering therapy continues to be suboptimal. Recent studies have underscored the potential success of guideline-directed therapy.\nRECENT FINDINGS: Adherence to gout treatment continues to be suboptimal according to multinational metaanalyses. Moreover, studies measuring adherence are prone to overestimation and each methodologic approach has intrinsic limitations. Adherence may be analyzed from the perspective of patient adherence to taking a medication, or provider adherence to treatment guidelines. In addition to considering traditional risk factors, adherence should be viewed through the lens of healthcare disparities. The RAmP-Up trial and Nottingham Gout Treatment trial demonstrate the success of protocolized gout treatment using existing guidelines for reference.\nSUMMARY: Standardized gout treatment protocols should be established for all primary care and specialty practices. Two successful methods of improving adherence include using nonphysician providers to coordinate urate lowering therapy titration and monitoring serum urate. Having more frequent outpatient visits to focus on direct patient care and education has also been successful.",

        "Abstract":"The Bayesian decision-analytic approach to trial design uses prior distributions for treatment effects, updated with likelihoods for proposed trial data. Prior distributions for treatment effects based on previous trial results risks sample selection bias and difficulties when a proposed trial differs in terms of patient characteristics, medication adherence, or treatment doses and regimens. The aim of this study was to demonstrate the utility of using pharmacometric-based clinical trial simulation (CTS) to generate prior distributions for use in Bayesian decision-theoretic trial design. The methods consisted of four principal stages: a CTS to predict the distribution of treatment response for a range of trial designs; Bayesian updating for a proposed sample size; a pharmacoeconomic model to represent the perspective of a reimbursement authority in which price is contingent on trial outcome; and a model of the pharmaceutical company return on investment linking drug prices to sales revenue. We used a case study of febuxostat versus allopurinol for the treatment of hyperuricemia in patients with gout. Trial design scenarios studied included alternative treatment doses, inclusion criteria, input uncertainty, and sample size. Optimal trial sample sizes varied depending on the uncertainty of model inputs, trial inclusion criteria, and treatment doses. This interdisciplinary framework for trial design and sample size calculation may have value in supporting decisions during later phases of drug development and in identifying costly sources of uncertainty, and thus inform future research and development strategies.",

After rigorous evaluation on quality, the data was extracted from included publications.\nRESULTS: A total of 10 articles involving 6989 subjects were included, with 4841 receiving febuxostat and 2148 using allopurinol. The pooled analysis showed that the febuxostat group (40, 80, or 120 mg QD) was greater in reducing serum urate levels than the allopurinol group (200 or 300 mg) (RR=1.56, 95% CI=1.37-1.78, P<0.00001).

Blood samples were collected within 15 min of admission (Day 1), after 48-72 h (Day 3), and between Days 7 and 21 (Day 14). The AHF patients were divided into two groups according to the XOR activity on Day 1: the high-XOR group (≥100 pmol\/h\/mL, n = 85) and the low-XOR group (<100 pmol\/h\/mL, n = 102).

        "Abstract":"Patients with gout are at a higher risk of cardiovascular disease, which is associated with hyperlipidemia. Management of gout in Taiwan is poor, and the association between urate-lowering therapy (ULT) among gout patients and hyperlipidemia is unclear. We conducted a retrospective cohort study using data from the Longitudinal Health Insurance Database (LHID) of Taiwan on new-onset gout patients and a comparison cohort without gout. A Cox proportional hazards model was used to analyze differences in the risk of hyperlipidemia between patients with and without gout after considering related comorbidities. We also examined the ULT medications on the hepatic expression of lipogenesis-related genes. After adjusting for potential confounders, the case group (44,413 patients) was found to have a higher risk of hyperlipidemia than the control cohort (177,652 patients) [adjusted hazards ratio (aHR) = 2.55]. Gout patients without antigout treatment had significantly higher risk of hyperlipidemia than the control cohort (aHR = 3.10). Among gout patients receiving ULT, except those receiving probenecid (aHR = 0.80), all had significantly lower risk of hyperlipidemia than gout patients without ULT (all aHR < 0.90). Using real-time polymerase chain reaction, we found that most of the antigout drugs decreased the expression of hepatic genes related to lipogenesis in differentiated HepaRG cells. These data indicate that these antigout drugs reduce hyperlipidemia in gout patients, partly via the reduction in expression of lipogenesis-related genes, leading to improved blood lipid profiles. We provide evidence of the strong association between gout and hyperlipidemia and highlight the need for appropriate treatment guidelines.",

        "Abstract":"BACKGROUND: Gout, inflammatory arthritis caused by the deposition of monosodium urate crystals into affected joints and other tissues, has become one of the major health problems of today's world. The main risk factor for gout is hyperuricemia, which may be caused by excessive or insufficient excretion of uric acid. The incidence is usually in the age group of 30- 50 years, commonly in males. In developed countries, the incidence of gout ranges from 1 to 4%. Despite effective treatments, there has been an increase in the number of cases over the past few decades.\nOBJECTIVE: In recent years, the development of targeted drugs in gout has made significant achievements. The global impact of gout continues to increase, and as a result, the focus of disease-modifying therapies remains elusive. In addition, the characterization of available instrumental compounds is urgently needed to explore the use of novel selective and key protein-ligand interactions for the effective treatment of gout. Xanthine oxidase (XO) is a key target in gout to consider the use of XO inhibitors in patients with mild to moderate condition, however, the costs are high, and no other direct progress has been made. Despite many XO inhibitors, a selective potent inhibitor for XO is limited. Likewise, in recent years, attention has been focused on different strategies for the discovery and development of new selectivity ligands against transforming growth factor beta- activated kinase 1 (TAK1), a potential therapeutic target for gout. Therefore, the insight on human XO structure and TAK1 provides a clue into protein-ligand interactions and provides the basis for molecular modeling and structure-based drug design.\nCONCLUSION: In this review, we briefly introduce the clinical characteristics, the development of crystal, inhibitors, and crystal structure of XO and TAK1 protein.",

A recent publication suggested that surgery in gout is more prevalent than previously reported. This revelation led us to review what is known about surgical treatment of gout.\nRECENT FINDINGS: The Google Scholar database (January 1, 2014-January 1, 2020) found 104 publications with a total of 169 gout patients, with an average disease duration of 6.7 years. Most (68%) were not on ULT. The mean pre-operative serum urate levels were 9.19 mg\/dL. One hundred thirteen patients underwent tophi excision, while in 33 patients, tophi were found during surgery. The majority of the surgeries were performed in Asia and Europe. Most patients were not taking ULT at the time of surgery, leading to hyperuricemia. This can result in tophi reformation post-surgery. The role of surgery should be a last-line treatment and until recently has only been demonstrated through case reports.",

        "Published":"2020-11-20",
        "Abstract":"['4mm', '4mm']\nElevated serum uric acid level was reportedly associated with greater coronary lipid plaque. Xanthine oxidoreductase (XOR) is a rate-limiting enzyme in purine metabolism and believed to play an important role in coronary atherosclerosis. However, the relation of XOR to coronary lipid plaque and its mechanism are unclear. Patients with stable coronary artery disease undergoing elective percutaneous coronary intervention under near-infrared spectroscopy intravascular ultrasound (NIRS-IVUS) guidance were prospectively enrolled. They were divided into three groups according to serum XOR activities: low, normal, and high. Coronary lipid core plaques in non-target vessels were evaluated by NIRS-IVUS with lipid core burden index (LCBI) and a maximum LCBI in 4 mm (maxLCBI). Systemic endothelial function and inflammation were assessed with reactive hyperemia index (RHI) and high-sensitivity C-reactive protein, neutrophil-to-lymphocyte ratio, and platelet-to-lymphocyte ratio. Of 68 patients, 26, 31, and 11 were classified as low, normal, and high XOR activity groups. LCBI (474.4 ± 171.6 vs. 347.4 ± 181.6 vs. 294.0 ± 155.9, p = 0.04) and maxLCBI (102.1 ± 56.5 vs. 65.6 ± 48.5 vs. 55.6 ± 37.8, p = 0.04) were significantly higher in high XOR group than in normal and low XOR groups. Although RHI was significantly correlated with body mass index, diabetes, current smoking, and high-density lipoprotein cholesterol, no relation was found between XOR activity and RHI. There were also no relations between XOR activity and C-reactive protein, neutrophil-to-lymphocyte ratio, or platelet-to-lymphocyte ratio. In conclusion, elevated XOR activity was associated with greater coronary lipid core plaque in patients with stable coronary artery disease, without significant relations to systemic endothelial function and inflammation.",

        "Abstract":"OBJECTIVE: This ancillary study examined the impact of depressive symptoms on the effectiveness of a urate-lowering therapy in the context of a clinical trial.\nMETHODS: Participants included 67 adults (ages 18-40) with elevated blood pressure who were enrolled in a double-blind, randomized, crossover clinical trial evaluating the effectiveness of allopurinol (300 mg\/d) versus placebo to decrease blood pressure. Depressive symptoms were measured at the beginning of each 4-week phase with the Center for Epidemiological Studies Depression scale (CESD-10). Serum urate (sUA) was assessed at the beginning and end of each treatment phase. Compliance to treatment was measured by having detectable oxypurinol levels. Linear regressions tested associations between depressive symptoms and change in sUA in each phase, adjusting for sex and race. Logistic regression predicted compliance from depressive symptoms.\nRESULTS: Participants had a mean age of 27 years and were 64% male and 39% African American. sUA levels decreased during the allopurinol treatment period but did not change during the placebo period. Higher depressive symptoms at pretreatment were associated with an attenuated urate-lowering response during the allopurinol phase (β = 0.24, p < 0.05), but had no effect on sUA changes during the placebo phase. Depressive symptoms were not associated with treatment compliance assessed by oxypurinol levels.\nCONCLUSION: Depressive symptoms were associated with reduced efficacy of allopurinol treatment for hyperuricemia in a clinical trial targeting hypertension. Studies evaluating the efficacy of urate-lowering therapies may benefit from screening for depressive symptoms.",

        "Published":"2020-11-09",
        "Abstract":"BACKGROUND: Febuxostat and allopurinol are urate-lowering therapies used to treat patients with gout. Following concerns about the cardiovascular safety of febuxostat, the European Medicines Agency recommended a post-licensing study assessing the cardiovascular safety of febuxostat compared with allopurinol.\nMETHODS: We did a prospective, randomised, open-label, blinded-endpoint, non-inferiority trial of febuxostat versus allopurinol in patients with gout in the UK, Denmark, and Sweden. Eligible patients were 60 years or older, already receiving allopurinol, and had at least one additional cardiovascular risk factor. Those who had myocardial infarction or stroke in the previous 6 months or who had severe congestive heart failure or severe renal impairment were excluded. After a lead-in phase in which allopurinol dose was optimised towards achieving a serum urate concentration of less than 0·357 mmol\/L (<6 mg\/dL), patients were randomly assigned (1:1, with stratification according to previous cardiovascular events) to continue allopurinol (at the optimised dose) or start febuxostat at 80 mg\/day, increasing to 120 mg\/day if necessary to achieve the target serum urate concentration. The primary outcome was a composite of hospitalisation for non-fatal myocardial infarction or biomarker-positive acute coronary syndrome; non-fatal stroke; or cardiovascular death. The hazard ratio (HR) for febuxostat versus allopurinol in a Cox proportional hazards model (adjusted for the stratification variable and country) was assessed for non-inferiority (HR limit 1·3) in an on-treatment analysis. This study is registered with the EU Clinical Trials Register (EudraCT 2011-001883-23) and ISRCTN (ISRCTN72443728) and is now closed.\nFINDINGS: From Dec 20, 2011, to Jan 26, 2018, 6128 patients (mean age 71·0 years [SD 6·4], 5225 [85·3%] men, 903 [14·7%] women, 2046 [33·4%] with previous cardiovascular disease) were enrolled and randomly allocated to receive allopurinol (n=3065) or febuxostat (n=3063). By the study end date (Dec 31, 2019), 189 (6·2%) patients in the febuxostat group and 169 (5·5%) in the allopurinol group withdrew from all follow-up. Median follow-up time was 1467 days (IQR 1029-2052) and median on-treatment follow-up was 1324 days (IQR 870-1919). For incidence of the primary endpoint, on-treatment, febuxostat (172 patients [1·72 events per 100 patient-years]) was non-inferior to allopurinol (241 patients [2·05 events per 100 patient-years]; adjusted HR 0·85 [95% CI 0·70-1·03], p<0·0001). In the febuxostat group, 222 (7·2%) of 3063 patients died and 1720 (57·3%) of 3001 in the safety analysis set had at least one serious adverse event (with 23 events in 19 [0·6%] patients related to treatment). In the allopurinol group, 263 (8·6%) of 3065 patients died and 1812 (59·4%) of 3050 had one or more serious adverse events (with five events in five [0·2%] patients related to treatment). Randomised therapy was discontinued in 973 (32·4%) patients in the febuxostat group and 503 (16·5%) patients in the allopurinol group.\nINTERPRETATION: Febuxostat is non-inferior to allopurinol therapy with respect to the primary cardiovascular endpoint, and its long-term use is not associated with an increased risk of death or serious adverse events compared with allopurinol.\nFUNDING: Menarini, Ipsen, and Teijin Pharma Ltd.",

To our knowledge, ixazomib has not been associated with TLS in MM.\nPATIENT CONCERNS: The patient developed TLS after 10 days of treatment with ixazomib, accompanied by renal failure of hyperuricemia, hyperkalemia, and hyperphosphatemia.\nDIAGNOSES: MM (type IgG λ) was diagnosed according to the diagnostic criteria established by the International Myeloma Working Group and classified stage IIA by the International Staging System. TLS was diagnosed after the patient met all three criteria of the Cairo-Bishop TLS scoring system.\nINTERVENTIONS: From April 8, 2017, the patient was treated with 3 courses of bortezomib, cyclophosphamide, and dexamethasone chemotherapy. From August 18, she received five courses of bortezomib combined with DCEP chemotherapy. On May 21, 2018 treatment was switched to lenalidomide, bortezomib, and dexamethasone for four courses.

        "Abstract":"®\nIn Jan 2020, dotinurad (URECE tablets) was approved for gout and hyperuricemia therapy in Japan. We developed a novel hypouricemic agent because benzbromarone, a commercially available uricosuric agent, has several problems, such as drug-induced liver injury or drug-drug interaction caused by CYP2C9 inhibition. In transporter-overexpressing cells, dotinurad potently inhibited URAT1 which is localized in the renal proximal tubules and functions as a urate reabsorption. On the contrary, dotinurad hardly inhibited urate secretion transporters, ABCG2 or OAT1\/3. In Cebus monkeys, dotinurad dose-dependently decreased plasma urate levels at low doses compared with benzbromarone. Inhibitory effect of dotinurad on mitochondria was weaker than that of benzbromarone and there was no observation suggesting a risk of drug-induced liver injury taking into consideration the clinical dose or exposure. Dotinurad weakly inhibited CYPs and further analysis indicated there was no drug-drug interaction risk in the clinical dose. In clinical pharmacology studies, there was no difference among sex and age. Furthermore, dosage and administration are equal even in hepatic impairment patients (mild to severe) and renal impairment patients (mild to moderate). In confirmatory phase II and long-term studies, dotinurad decreased serum urate levels at low doses and almost patients using maintenance dose (2 or 4 mg) achieved a serum urate level ≤ 6.0 mg\/dL. Moreover, there was no finding to raise safety concern including liver injury. In conclusion, dotinurad, a selective urate reabsorption inhibitor (SURI) could be a therapeutic option because of its more effective hypouricemic action at low doses than those of commercially available uricosuric agents.",

Verinurad is a novel, potent, specific urate reabsorption inhibitor. We evaluated the effects on albuminuria of intensive urate-lowering therapy with verinurad combined with the xanthine oxidase inhibitor febuxostat in patients with hyperuricemia and type 2 diabetes mellitus (T2DM).\nSTUDY DESIGN: Phase 2, multicenter, prospective, randomized, double-blind, parallel-group, placebo-controlled trial.\nSETTING & PARTICIPANTS: Patients 18 years or older with hyperuricemia, albuminuria, and T2DM.\nINTERVENTION: Patients randomly assigned 1:1 to verinurad (9mg) plus febuxostat (80mg) or matched placebo once daily for 24 weeks.\nOUTCOMES: The primary end point was change in urinary albumin-creatinine ratio (UACR) from baseline after 12 weeks' treatment. Secondary end points included safety and tolerability and effect on glomerular filtration.\nRESULTS: 60 patients were enrolled (n=32, verinurad and febuxostat; n=28, placebo). UACRs after treatment with verinurad plus febuxostat were lower than after placebo at 1, 12, and 24 weeks: -38.6% (90% CI, -60.9% to-3.6%), -39.4% (90% CI, -61.8% to-3.8%), and-49.3% (90% CI, -68.2% to-19.0%), respectively. Serum urate levels after treatment with verinurad plus febuxostat were 59.6% and 63.7% lower than after placebo at 12 and 24 weeks, respectively. No clinically meaningful changes were observed in estimated glomerular filtration rate or serum creatinine or serum cystatin C concentrations.

However, in addition to CKD, hyperuricemia is frequently associated with a number of other conditions such as hypertension, type 2 diabetes, obesity, and heart failure, overweight, and cardiovascular disease.\nRECENT FINDINGS: It is now becoming increasingly clear that, in many clinical conditions, elevated levels of uric acid have a much greater role beyond just causing gout. The present review will summarize current knowledge on the relation between hyperuricemia, CKD, and existing comorbidities, as well as the mechanisms of uric acid-related renal damage. In addition, the role and evidence for urate-lowering therapy in prevention and cardiovascular protection in CKD patients is discussed with a focus on allopurinol and febuxostat. To date, several clinical studies have provided evidence that urate-lowering therapy may help to prevent and delay the decline of renal function in patients with CKD. Use of a xanthine oxidase inhibitor should be considered in patients who are at high renal risk and\/or with declining renal function in the presence of hyperuricemia with and without deposition, although additional studies are warranted to define treatment targets.

Gout is characterized by swelling, pain, or tenderness in a peripheral joint or bursa, including the development of a tophus. Diagnosis of gout can be made using several validated clinical prediction rules. Arthrocentesis should be performed when suspicion for an underlying septic joint is present; synovial fluid or tophus analysis should be performed if the diagnosis is uncertain. Colchicine, nonsteroidal anti-inflammatory drugs, and corticosteroids relieve pain in adults with acute gout episodes. Indications for long-term urate-lowering therapy include chronic kidney disease, two or more flare-ups per year, urolithiasis, the presence of tophus, chronic gouty arthritis, and joint damage.

        "Abstract":"PURPOSE: This network meta-analysis aimed to assess the current efficacy of decreasing the uric acid (UA) level with drugs to reduce mortality in patients with heart failure (HF).\nMETHODS: Electronic literature searches using EMBASE and MEDLINE of studies published from 1 Jan 1950 to 26 Dec 2019 were conducted for randomized controlled trials or non-randomized cohort studies that included at least one group of patients who took UA-lowering drugs and with a study outcome of all-cause mortality. A random-effects network meta-analysis was performed within a frequentist framework. Hierarchy of treatments was expressed as the surface under the cumulative ranking curve (SUCRA) value, which is in proportion to mean rank (best is 100%).\nRESULTS: Nine studies, which included seven different types of groups, were eligible for analysis. The \"untreated uricemia\" group in which patients had hyperuricemia but without treatment had a significantly higher risk of mortality than the \"no uricemia\" group in which patients had no hyperuricemia (relative risk (RR)(95% confidence interval (CI), 1.43 (1.08-1.89)). The \"start-allo\" group wherein patients started to take allopurinol did not have a significantly lower risk of mortality than the \"untreated uricemia\" group (RR (95% CI), 0.68 (0.45-1.01)). However, in the \"start-allo\" group the SUCRA value was comparable to that in the \"no uricemia\" group (SUCRA: 65.4% for \"start-allo\"; 64.1% for \"no uricemia\").\nCONCLUSIONS: Results suggested that allopurinol therapy was not associated with a significantly improved prognosis in terms of mortality but could potentially counteract the adverse effects associated with longstanding hyperuricemia in HF patients.",

        "Abstract":"INTRODUCTION: In the general population, hyperuricemia is associated with increased morbidity and mortality. Data on this association in hemodialysis patients is controversial. Moreover, it remains elusive whether serum uric acid (SUA) lowering therapy is associated with mortality.\nMETHODS: Retrospective analysis of 601 patients on chronic hemodialysis therapy in five outpatient centers with a maximum follow-up of 100 and a mean follow-up of 41 months. Death was defined as primary endpoint. Cumulative survival was analyzed by Kaplan-Meier analysis and Cox regressions adjusted for age.\nFINDINGS: Cumulative survival rates were higher for those subjects with a higher than median SUA concentration both based on mean annual and baseline measurements ( < 0.05 each). There was no survival difference anymore after adjustment for age ( > 0.05 each). Stratification for SUA lowering therapy (allopurinol\/febuxostat) had no impact on cumulative survival, neither in Kaplan Meier nor in Cox regression analyses ( > 0.05 each). Furthermore, Cox regression analysis excluded an increased cardiovascular mortality in subjects with hyperuricemia.\nDISCUSSION: In contrast to the general population, hyperuricemia is not associated with increased mortality in patients undergoing hemodialysis. Moreover, xanthine oxidase inhibition was not associated with a survival benefit in this analysis. These data do not support the use of SUA lowering medication in hemodialysis patients with asymptomatic hyperuricemia.",

        "Abstract":"CONTEXT: Combining a sodium-glucose cotransporter 2 inhibitor with a xanthine oxidase inhibitor (XOI) and a urate transporter 1 (URAT1) inhibitor may enhance serum uric acid (sUA) lowering. However, concerns exist regarding high urinary UA (uUA) excretion rates and subsequent crystallization in renal tubules.\nOBJECTIVE: To assess whether dapagliflozin added to verinurad, a selective URAT1 inhibitor, and febuxostat, an XOI, increases uUA excretion.\nDESIGN: Randomized, placebo-controlled, 2-way crossover study (NCT03316131).\nPATIENTS: Adults with asymptomatic hyperuricemia.\nINTERVENTIONS: Subjects (N = 36) were randomized to oral once-daily 9 mg verinurad plus 80 mg febuxostat plus 10 mg dapagliflozin for 7 days and 7 days of oral once-daily 9 mg verinurad plus 80 mg febuxostat plus placebo with an intervening 7- to 21-day washout period.\nMAIN OUTCOME MEASURE: Difference in peak uUA excretion between groups from baseline to day 7. Secondary outcomes included changes in sUA levels and 24-h uUA excretion.\nRESULTS: Both regimens lowered mean peak uUA excretion (least squares mean changes from baseline: -12.9 mg\/h [95% confidence interval (CI): -21.0 to -4.7], dapagliflozin; -13.2 mg\/h [95% CI -21.3 to -5.0], placebo). sUA concentrations were lower with dapagliflozin (mean treatment difference -62.3 µmol\/L [95% CI -82.8 to -41.8]). Dapagliflozin did not impact verinurad pharmacokinetics, its main metabolites, or febuxostat or fasting plasma glucose levels vs verinurad plus febuxostat. There were no clinically relevant changes in safety parameters.\nCONCLUSIONS: Dapagliflozin further reduced sUA without influencing uUA excretion, suggesting that its combination with verinurad and febuxostat at the doses tested does not adversely affect kidney function.\nCLINICAL TRIAL REGISTRATION NUMBER: NCT03316131.",

        "Abstract":"BACKGROUND AND OBJECTIVES: Several clinical practice guidelines noted the potential benefits of urate-lowering therapy on cardiovascular disease and CKD progression; however, the effect of this regimen remains uncertain. In this systematic review, we aimed to evaluate the efficacy of urate-lowering therapy on major adverse cardiovascular events, all-cause mortality, kidney failure events, BP, and GFR.\nDESIGN, SETTING, PARTICIPANTS, & MEASUREMENTS: We systematically searched MEDLINE, Embase, and the Cochrane databases for trials published through July 2020. We included prospective, randomized, controlled trials assessing the effects of urate-lowering therapy for at least 6 months on cardiovascular or kidney outcomes. Relevant information was extracted into a spreadsheet by two authors independently. Treatment effects were summarized using random effects meta-analysis.\nRESULTS: We identified 28 trials including a total of 6458 participants with 506 major adverse cardiovascular events and 266 kidney failure events. Overall urate-lowering therapy did not show benefits on major adverse cardiovascular events (risk ratio, 0.93; 95% confidence interval, 0.74 to 1.18) and all-cause mortality (risk ratio, 1.04; 95% confidence interval, 0.78 to 1.39) or kidney failure (risk ratio, 0.97; 95% confidence interval, 0.61 to 1.54). Nevertheless, urate-lowering therapy attenuated the decline in the slope of GFR (weighted mean difference, 1.18 ml\/min per 1.73 m per year; 95% confidence interval, 0.44 to 1.91) and lowered the mean BP (systolic BP: weighted mean difference, -3.45 mm Hg; 95% confidence interval, -6.10 to -0.80; diastolic BP: weighted mean difference, -2.02 mm Hg; 95% confidence interval, -3.25 to -0.78). There was no significant difference (risk ratio, 1.01; 95% confidence interval, 0.94 to 1.08) in the risk of adverse events between the participants receiving urate-lowering therapy and the control group.\nCONCLUSIONS: Urate-lowering therapy did not produce benefits on the clinical outcomes, including major adverse cardiovascular events, all-cause mortality, and kidney failure. Thus, there is insufficient evidence to support urate lowering in patients to improve kidney and cardiovascular outcomes.",

        "Abstract":"Previous research has investigated whether hyperuricemia serves as an independent risk factor for cardiovascular and renal diseases. Hyperuricemia is defined as an abnormally high level of uric acid (UA; i.e., serum urate level > 6.8 mg\/dL). Hyperuricemia has been considered a complication of chronic kidney disease (CKD). However, it seems to play a pathogenic role in the progression of renal diseases. There has been increasing focus on the link between hyperuricemia and CKD. The results of randomized controlled trials have implied independent associations between hyperuricemia and the progression of cardiovascular and renal morbidities. These associations may be mediated by renin-angiotensin system activation, nitric oxide synthase inhibition, and macrovascular\/microvascular disease development. There remains controversy regarding the use of serum UA level as an indirect index of renal vascular disease. This literature review focuses on the role of asymptomatic hyperuricemia in the progression of CKD, as well as the association between hyperuricemia and cardiovascular disease. It also provides a general overview of the physiological metabolism of UA.",

        "Abstract":"BACKGROUND\/OBJECTIVE: Pegloticase is used for treatment of refractory gout, which has failed maximal medical management, but only 42% of patients respond completely to treatment because of the presumed development of antidrug antibodies, which rapidly clear the pegloticase molecule. Immunomodulatory medications temper antidrug antibody development in other diseases. The aim of this case series was to investigate the utility of adding methotrexate to a pegloticase regimen to increase the response durability in a real-world practice setting.\nMETHODS: In this multicenter, proof-of-concept, observational case series, refractory tophaceous gouty arthropathy patients being started on pegloticase 8 mg every 2 weeks were identified. The patients began oral methotrexate 15 mg\/wk and folic acid 1 mg\/d, 1 month prior to the initial pegloticase administration, and continued throughout pegloticase treatment. Responders were defined by demonstrating ≥80% of preinfusion serum uric acid (sUA) levels <6.0 mg\/dL between months 3 and 6.\nRESULTS: Ten sequential patients, aged 35 to 80 years, identified between May 2017 and June 2018, from 3 separate infusion centers were followed for up to 10 months. All patients maintained methotrexate 15 mg\/wk without dose adjustments. There were 143 total pegloticase infusions. All 10 patients completed a full course of pegloticase treatment with 100% response and no infusion reactions. No patients stopped pegloticase therapy because of increased sUA, loss of response, or gout flares.\nCONCLUSIONS: Pretreatment and coadministration of methotrexate with pegloticase resulted in 100% maintenance of pegloticase sUA response with no infusion reactions. These data support the potential use of immunomodulation with methotrexate to improve durability of pegloticase response in the treatment of refractory gout.",

For this reason, the studies published on uric acid (UA)-lowering drugs in the English language from 2000 to August 2019 have been carefully reviewed. The terms \"serum uric acid,\" \"xanthine oxidase,\" \"allopurinol,\" \"febuxostat,\" and \"topiroxostat\" were incorporated into an electronic search strategy, alone and in combinations, in both MEDLINE (National Library of Medicine, Bethesda, MD) and the Cochrane Register of Controlled Trials (The Cochrane Collaboration, Oxford, UK). Even if new urate-lowering drugs seem of particular efficacy for acute treatment of refractory hyperuricemia, their use is supported by relatively small clinical evidence. On the contrary, large long-term clinical trials have demonstrated that xanthine oxidase inhibitors (XOIs, namely, allopurinol and febuxostat) are effective, safe, and relatively well-tolerated in most of the patients. They have mainly been tested in the elderly, in patients affected by chronic diseases such as heart failure and cancer, and in patients taking a large number of drugs, confirming their safety profile. Recent data also show that they could exert some positive effects on vascular health, renal function, and glucose metabolism. Their cost is also low. In conclusion, XOIs remain the first choice of UA-lowering drug for chronic treatment.",

        "Abstract":"BACKGROUND: Tumor lysis syndrome (TLS) is a metabolic emergency in hematology patients. The recommended dose of rasburicase for the management of TLS is 0.2 mg\/kg per day for 5 days, which is cost prohibitive for many patients. We sought to determine the efficacy of single low-dose rasburicase in the prevention and treatment of hyperuricemia in TLS.\nPATIENTS AND METHODS: We planned a prospective study for the safety and efficacy of fixed (weight based) dose of rasburicase to manage TLS. Patients diagnosed with leukemia\/lymphoma with laboratory or clinically confirmed TLS or presence of ≥ 2 high-risk factors and serum uric acid > 7.5 mg\/dL were included. The primary endpoint was uric acid normalization (< 7.5 mg\/dL) within 24 hours of rasburicase administration.\nRESULTS: Fifty-five patients were recruited for this study. Pediatric patients (< 18 years) accounted for 43.6% of cases. Rasburicase was provided prophylactically to 43 patients (78.2%) and for treating TLS to 12 (21.8%). Mean ± standard deviation serum uric acid at baseline and 24 hours was 9.2 ± 1.8 mg\/dL and 3.2 ± 2.1 mg\/dL, respectively. There was significant reduction in the serum uric acid and creatinine (P < .001) within 24 hours of rasburicase administration. The response was maintained up to 72 hours. A single dose of rasburicase was effective in 94.5% of patients. Single low-dose rasburicase led to 95% direct cost savings compared to the recommended dose.\nCONCLUSION: Single-dose rasburicase with frequent laboratory monitoring is effective in the management of TLS and offers significant cost reductions.",

Those with frequent gout attacks had significantly longer gout duration, a higher serum urate level, and more urate deposition shown by US than those with infrequent gout attacks (P < 0.05). In both univariate and logistic regression analyses, frequent gout attacks were correlated with gout duration, serum urate level, and urate deposition as shown by US (P < 0.05).\nCONCLUSION: These findings indicate that urate deposition shown by US is independently associated with frequent gout attacks.

The first phase of the study was a 6-month US follow-up after starting urate-lowering therapy (ULT) with gout flare prophylaxis. After 6 months of ULT, gout flare prophylaxis was stopped, followed by a clinical follow-up (M6 to 12) and ULT was maintained. Outcomes were the proportion of relapsing patients between M6 and M12 according to changes of US features of gout and determining a threshold decrease in tophus size according to the probability of relapse.\nRESULTS: We included 79 gouty patients [mean (±SD) age 61.8±14 years, 91% males, median disease duration 4 (IQR 1.5;10) years]. Among the 49 completers at M12, 23 (47%) experienced relapse. Decrease in tophus size ≥50% at M6 was more frequent without than with relapse (54% vs. 26%, P=0.049).

While the clinical implication of hyperuricemia in renal disease has been a contemporary topic of debate, growing body of bench and clinical evidences certainly suggest a causative role of high uric acid in renal abnormalities by implicating diverse pathologic and molecular mechanisms. Urate crystals after having deposited in the kidney could cause hyperuricemia nephropathy leading to glomerular hypertrophy and tubulointerstitial fibrosis, while high serum uric acid might predict progressive renal damage and dysfunction. Hyperuricemia could be associated with manifestation of tubular injury and macrophage infiltration as well as an increased expression of inflammatory mediators. This review sheds light on the mechanistic aspects pertaining to hyperuricemia-associated renal abnormalities. Besides, the renal detrimental actions of high uric acid possibly mediated through its potential role on oxidative stress, renal inflammation, endothelial dysfunction, glycocalyx shedding, endothelial-to-mesenchymal transition and more specifically on the renal epithelial-to-mesenchymal transition have been addressed. Moreover, this review discusses a number of potential targets such as endothelin-1, TLR4\/NF-kB, PI3K\/p-Akt, Wnt5a\/Ror2, NLRP3 inflammasome, NADPH oxidase, ERK1\/2, enhancer of zeste homolog 2, serum response factor and Smad3\/TGF-β signalling pathways, among others, implicated in hyperuricemia-associated renal abnormalities. This review finally apprises a number of bench and clinical studies which supporting a notion that the pharmacologic reduction of high uric acid might have a therapeutic value in the management of renal abnormalities, with an emphasis on febuxostat and its renal pleiotropic actions.",

        "Abstract":"Background The recommended dose of rasburicase is quite expensive, thus limiting its use. Whether a lower dose of rasburicase would be equally effective for critically ill children, who often have more complicated situations and a higher risk of hospital death, is still unknown. Objective To explore the safety and efficacy of low-dose rasburicase in critically ill children with haematological malignancies who are at high risk of tumour lysis syndrome. Setting A single-centre retrospective cohort study. Method Children with haematological malignancies who had a history of rasburicase exposure during an intensive care unit stay were enrolled. Patients were divided into two groups according to the initial dosage of rasburicase: the standard-dose group (> 0.1 mg\/kg\/day) and the low-dose group (≤ 0.1 mg\/kg\/day). The adverse events and short-term prognosis of the two groups were compared. Results Thirty-seven children were selected, 22 in the standard-dose group and 15 in the low-dose group. The most common tumour type was Burkitt's lymphoma (81%), followed by acute lymphoblastic leukaemia (11%). All patients were at high risk of tumour lysis syndrome, and 73% of them had 3 or more tumour lysis syndrome risk factors. The uric acid levels of 90% of patients with hyperuricaemia returned to the normal range within 12 h (100% in the standard-dose group and 75% in the low-dose group, P = 0.083). Eighty-four percent of patients presented serious complications, including tumour lysis syndrome (73%), acute kidney injury (59%), renal replacement treatment (24%), respiratory failure (24%), disseminated intravascular coagulation (16%) and heart failure (11%). There was no significant difference in the incidence of serious complications between the two groups. The overall 7-day and 28-day survival rates after intensive care unit admission were 86% and 84%, respectively. The average length of stay in the intensive care unit was 9.92 ± 5.13 days. Neither the short-term mortality nor the length of stay in the intensive care unit were significantly different between the two groups. Conclusion Low-dose rasburicase is effective and may be an acceptable choice for critically ill children with haematological malignancies.",

We evaluated whether lowering serum uric acid levels improves levels of biomarkers of kidney damage.\nSTUDY DESIGN: Post hoc analysis of clinical trial participants.\nSETTING & PARTICIPANTS: A double-blind randomized placebo-controlled study designed to lower serum uric acid levels. 80 patients with stage 3 CKD and asymptomatic hyperuricemia were randomly assigned to allopurinol treatment or placebo (300 mg\/d) for 12 weeks.\nEXPOSURE\/PREDICTOR: Allopurinol treatment versus placebo.\nOUTCOMES & MEASURES: We evaluated the change from baseline for the following urinary biomarkers of kidney damage: albumin-creatinine ratio (ACR), neutrophil gelatinase-associated lipocalin (NGAL), kidney injury molecule 1 (KIM-1), and transforming growth factor β1 (TGF-β1). Additionally, we evaluated CKD Epidemiology Collaboration (CKD-EPI)-estimated glomerular filtration rate (eGFR) and cystatin C eGFR.\nANALYTICAL APPROACH: Generalized linear mixed modeling was used.\nRESULTS: After 12 weeks, allopurinol (compared to placebo) significantly lowered serum uric acid levels with an estimate of -3.3 mg\/dL (95% CI, -4.1 to -2.5 mg\/dL;  < 0.001).

        "Abstract":"BACKGROUND AND OBJECTIVE: Febuxostat is a xanthine oxidase inhibitor indicated for gout and hyperuricemia. This work investigates potential clinically relevant covariates for febuxostat pharmacokinetics with a special focus on Asian race and bodyweight.\nMETHODS: Febuxostat plasma concentrations from 141 male subjects were obtained from two phase II studies in patients with hyperuricemia\/gout (NCT02246673, NCT02317861) and one study in healthy volunteers (NCT01883167). Subjects were administered febuxostat oral doses from 10 to 80 mg. The pharmacokinetics of febuxostat was analyzed using non-linear mixed-effects modeling as implemented in NONMEM 7.3.0. The dataset consisted of racially diverse subjects, 40% being Japanese, 10% of unknown Asian origin, 39% Caucasian, and 10% Black. Most subjects (n = 92, 63%) had normal creatinine clearance (90 mL\/min), while 52 subjects (36%) had mild renal impairment (creatinine clearance > 60 to < 90) at baseline. The effect of disease state, body weight, and creatinine clearance on febuxostat pharmacokinetics was investigated using stepwise covariate modeling.\nRESULTS: Febuxostat pharmacokinetics was well described by a two-compartment disposition model. Asian race was the only covariate resulting in a potentially clinically important increase in febuxostat area under the curve (1.64-fold, 90% confidence interval 1.48-1.79) compared with Caucasian individuals. The difference in body weight between Asian and Caucasian subjects did not explain the difference in febuxostat exposure. Absorption was modeled as a sequential zero- to first-order process with lag-time.\nCONCLUSIONS: In this pooled analysis of three studies, we show that Asian individuals have a 1.64-fold higher febuxostat exposure than Caucasians, independent of bodyweight or other investigated covariates. These findings may be of importance when selecting starting febuxostat doses in Asian patients.",

Dissolution rate had a stronger correlation with SU if calculated by compound method (Pearson's correlation coefficient = -0.77,  = .00) and was independent of baseline MSU load. The ensuing dissolution model was logarithmic and explained real-life scenarios. When SU > 0.43 mmol\/l, dissolution time approached infinity. It improved to 10-19 months at SU = 0.24 mmol\/l. When SU approximated zero (as with pegloticase), dissolution flattened and still took 4-8 months.\nCONCLUSION: MSU dissolution is better described as a logarithmic function of SU, which explains, predicts, and facilitates understanding of the dissolution process.",

        "Abstract":"PURPOSE: This study assessed factors associated with achieving target serum uric acid (sUA) level and occurrence of gouty arthritis in Japanese clinical practice.\nMETHODS: Japanese health insurance claims and medical check-up data from October 2015 to March 2017 were analyzed to assess factors associated with target sUA achievement in gout and asymptomatic hyperuricemia and gouty arthritis in gout. Target sUA was further assessed by subgroup analysis of urate-lowering therapy (ULT) prescriptions and outcomes, stratified by renal function.\nRESULTS: Patients achieving target sUA tended toward older, female, higher ULT dose, higher adherence, more comorbidities, and\/or antidiabetic drugs prescribed. Renal dysfunction and\/or diuretic prescriptions were associated with reduced achievement of target sUA. Severe renal dysfunction was particularly influential (odds ratio [OR] = 0.22 [95% confidence interval (CI): 0.10-0.48] for <15, 0.15 [0.10-0.23] for ≥15 to <30, compared with eGFR ≥90 mL\/min\/1.73 m ). Across all renal function categories, mean prescribed ULT dose was low (febuxostat 17.0-21.0 mg\/day, allopurinol 123.1-139.6 mg\/day), and target sUA achievement was reduced among renal dysfunction patients. Gouty arthritis was more likely in patients with a prior history of such occurrences, and less likely for higher ULT adherence, sUA monitored regularly at medical facilities, and\/or more comorbidities.\nCONCLUSION: In a real-world setting, severe renal dysfunction is the most important risk factor for failure to achieve the target sUA, suggesting suboptimal disease management in patients with gout or hyperuricemia complicated by this condition. Findings associated with gouty arthritis suggest that these occurrences could be successfully managed by regular monitoring of sUA and closer adherence to ULT.",

Patients were administered oral MTX (15 mg\/week) and folic acid (1 mg\/day) 4 weeks prior to and throughout pegloticase treatment. The primary study outcome was the proportion of responders, defined as serum uric acid (sUA) < 6 mg\/dL for ≥ 80% of the time during Month 6 (Weeks 20, 22, and 24). All analyses were performed on a modified intent-to-treat population, defined as patients who received ≥ 1 pegloticase infusion.\nRESULTS: Seventeen patients were screened and 14 patients (all men, average age 49.3 ± 8.7 years) were enrolled. On Day 1, mean sUA was 9.2 ± 2.5 mg\/dL, and 12 of the 14 patients had visible tophi.

All patients tolerated MTX. No new safety concerns were identified.\nCONCLUSION: In this study, an increased proportion of patients maintained therapeutic response at 6 months when treated concomitantly with MTX and pegloticase as compared to the previously reported 42% using pegloticase alone.

        "Abstract":"BACKGROUND: Hyperuricemia is an independent risk factor in chronic kidney disease (CKD). Allopurinol and febuxostat are prescription medicines used to treat hyperuricemia but suffer side-effects. Earlier clinical study has shown that an aqueous extract of Terminalia bellerica (TBE), significantly reduced uric acid levels with no serious adverse effects in hyperuricemic subjects. The objective of this study is to determine the efficacy and tolerability of TB in reducing uric acid and creatinine levels in CKD subjects.\nMETHODS: 59-subjects were randomized to three groups-40 mg-once-daily febuxostat, 500 mg-twice-daily and 1000 mg-twice-daily of TBE. Serum uric acid, creatinine levels and estimated-glometular-filtration-rate were measured at baseline, 4, 8, 12, 16, 20, 24-weeks. Biomarkers of oxidative-stress, endothelial function, systemic inflammation, and platelet-aggregation were evaluated at baseline, 4, 8, 12, 24-weeks. Adverse drug reactions were recorded. Statistical analysis evaluated using GraphPadPrism4.\nRESULTS: 55-subjects completed 24-week study. Starting at 4-weeks, all treatment groups showed a significant decrease in serum uric acid levels from baseline (p ≤ 0.0001). At 24-weeks, febuxostat, T.bellerica 500 mg-twice-daily, and T.bellerica 1000 mg-twice-daily doses decreased mean-percentage serum uric acid by 63.70 ± 4.62, 19.84 ± 6.43 and 33.88% ± 4.95% respectively (p ≤ 0.0001). Significant decrease in serum creatinine with all the groups starting at 16-weeks was seen (p ≤ 0.005-p ≤ 0.0001). At 24-weeks, the mean-percentage change in creatinine levels was 23.71 ± 12.50, 11.70 ± 9.0, and 24.42 ± 8.14, respectively with febuxostat, T.bellerica 500 mg-twice-daily and T.bellerica 1000 mg-twice-daily. Statistically significant (p ≤ 0.05) increase in estimated glomerular filtration rate-(eGFR) was seen at 20 (p ≤ 0.05) and 24-weeks (p ≤ 0.01) for both febuxostat vs T.bellerica 500 mg-twice-daily and T.bellerica 1000 mg-twice-daily vs T.bellerica 500 mg-twice-daily. There was no statistically significant difference between febuxostat and T.bellerica 1000 mg-twice-daily, with an increase of eGFR of 41.38 and 40.39 ml\/min\/1.73m respectively, with the inference that T.bellerica at 1000 mg-twice-daily dose is as good as febuxostat 40 mg-once-daily. Positive improvements were made by all the groups in endothelial function and the related biomarkers and high-sensitivity C-reactive protein. None of the products showed effect on platelet aggregation.\nCONCLUSION: In this 24-week study Febuxostat 40 mg, T. bellerica 500 mg-twice-daily and 1000 mg-twice-daily, significantly decreased the serum uric acid and creatinine levels, increased eGFR in CKD subjects. T. bellerica 500 mg-twice-daily and 1000 mg-twice-daily were one-third and more than half as effective at 24-weeks, respectively.

        "Abstract":"Uric acid is generated with reactive oxygen species via xanthine oxidase (XO), and hyperuricemia, which is identified as the excess of uric acid in the blood, has been associated with vascular endothelial dysfunction. However, the effects of urate-lowering medicines on endothelial function have not been fully elucidated. Thus this study determined and compared the effects of benzbromarone (urate transporter 1 inhibitor) and febuxostat (XO inhibitor) on endothelial function.This randomized, cross-over, open-label study initially recruited 30 patients with hyperuricemia. They were divided into two groups, treated initially with benzbromarone or febuxostat for three months and then were switched for the next three months. Endothelial function was defined as reactive hyperemia indexes (RHI) determined using Endo-PAT 2000 before and at three and six months after medication using the two agents. Blood levels of asymmetric dimethylarginine (ADMA) and high-molecular-weight (HMW) adiponectin were also compared. We finally analyzed data from 24 patients whose endothelial function was assessed as described above.Our findings show that levels of uric acid significantly decreased, whereas those of HMW adiponectin and the RHI have significantly increased after treatment with benzbromarone. Meanwhile, in patients administered with febuxostat, uric acid levels tended to decrease and RHI significantly decreased. Neither of the two agents altered ADMA levels. The changes in RHI (P = 0.026) and HMW adiponectin levels (P = 0.001) were found to be significantly greater in patients treated with benzbromarone than febuxostat. Changes in the levels of HMW adiponectin and of uric acid were significantly correlated (r = -0.424, P = 0.039).Benzbromarone has increased adiponectin besides reducing uric acid levels, and thus, this might confer more benefits on endothelial function than febuxostat.",

        "Published":"2020-09-03",
        "Abstract":"Hyperuricemia increases the risk of heart failure, and higher levels of serum uric acid are seen in patients who have worse ventricular function, functional capacity, and prognosis. Heart failure is also accompanied by an upregulation of xanthine oxidase, the enzyme that catalyzes the formation of uric acid and a purported source of reactive oxygen species. However, the available evidence does not support the premise that either uric acid or the activation of xanthine oxidase has direct injurious effects on the heart in the clinical setting. Xanthine oxidase inhibitors (allopurinol and oxypurinol) have had little benefit and may exert detrimental effects in patients with chronic heart failure in randomized controlled trials, and the more selective and potent inhibitor febuxostat increases the risk of cardiovascular death more than allopurinol. Instead, the available evidence indicates that changes in xanthine oxidase and uric acid are biomarkers of oxidative stress (particularly in heart failure) and that xanthine oxidase may provide an important source of nitric oxide that quenches the injurious effects of reactive oxygen species. A primary determinant of the cellular redox state is nicotinamide adenine dinucleotide, whose levels drive an inverse relationship between xanthine oxidase and sirtuin-1, a nutrient deprivation sensor that exerts important antioxidant and cardioprotective effects. Interestingly, sodium-glucose cotransporter 2 inhibitors induce a state of nutrient deprivation that includes activation of sirtuin-1, suppression of xanthine oxidase, and lowering of serum uric acid. The intermediary role of sirtuin-1 in both uric acid-lowering and cardioprotection may explain why, in mediation analyses of large-scale cardiovascular trials, the effect of sodium-glucose cotransporter 2 inhibitors to decrease serum uric acid is a major predictor of the ability of these drugs to decrease serious heart failure events.",

        "Abstract":"OBJECTIVE: To determine the incidence and prevalence of gout in the general population and the utilisation of urate-lowering therapy (ULT) among patients with gout in Hong Kong.\nMETHODS: A total of 2,741,862 subjects who attended any outpatient clinics or accident and emergency department (with or without hospitalisation) in 2005 and did not die before 2006 were identified from the Clinical Data Analysis and Reporting System (CDARS) of the Hospital Authority in Hong Kong. All subjects were followed until the end of 2016 or death. Demographics, diagnosis of gout, serum urate levels, and ULT prescriptions were retrieved from CDARS. Gout was defined by the diagnosis codes in CDARS. The serum urate levels achieved after prescribing ULT were the means of all serum urate levels measured 6 months after prescriptions. Results were analysed by R version 3.3.3 with package 'prevalence' version 0.4.0.\nRESULTS: The crude incidence of gout increased from 113.05\/100,000 person-years (PY) in 2006 to 211.62\/100,000 PY in 2016. The crude prevalence of gout increased from 1.56% in 2006 to 2.92% in 2016. Only 25.55% of patients with gout were prescribed ULT in 2016. 35.8% of patients treated with ULT were able to achieve the target serum urate level of < 6 mg\/dL.\nCONCLUSIONS: Population ageing as well as other risk factors contributed to an increase in the incidence and prevalence of gout in Hong Kong. In 2016, the crude prevalence of gout in Hong Kong was comparable to that in many western countries. However, only one in four patients with gout in Hong Kong was prescribed ULT.",

        "Abstract":"BACKGROUND: This is the second update of this systematic review. High blood pressure represents a major public health problem. Worldwide, approximately one-fourth of the adult population has hypertension. Epidemiological and experimental studies suggest a link between hyperuricaemia and hypertension. Hyperuricaemia affects 25% to 40% of those with untreated hypertension; a much lower prevalence has been reported in those with normotension or in the general population. However, whether lowering serum uric acid (UA) might lower blood pressure (BP), is an unanswered question.\nOBJECTIVES: To determine whether UA-lowering agents reduce BP in people with primary hypertension or prehypertension, compared with placebo.\nSEARCH METHODS: The Cochrane Hypertension Information Specialist searched the following databases for randomised controlled trials up to May 2020: the Cochrane Hypertension Specialised Register, CENTRAL 2018, Issue 12, MEDLINE (from 1946), Embase (from 1974), the World Health Organization International Clinical Trials Registry Platform, and ClinicalTrials.gov. We also searched LILACS (1982 to May 2020), and contacted authors of relevant papers regarding further published and unpublished work. The searches had no language or date restrictions.\nSELECTION CRITERIA: To be included in this updated review, the studies had to meet the following criteria: 1) randomised or quasi-randomised, with a group assigned to receive a UA-lowering agent and another group assigned to receive placebo; 2) double-blind, single-blind, or open-label; 3) parallel or cross-over trial design; 4) cross-over trials had to have a washout period of at least two weeks; 5) minimum treatment duration of four weeks; 6) participants had to have a diagnosis of essential hypertension or prehypertension plus hyperuricaemia (serum UA greater than 6 mg\/dL in women, 7 mg\/dL in men, and 5.5 mg\/dL in children or adolescents); 7) outcome measures included change in 24-hour ambulatory systolic or diastolic BP, or both; or clinic-measured systolic or diastolic BP, or both.\nDATA COLLECTION AND ANALYSIS: The two review authors independently collected the data using a data extraction form, and resolved any disagreements via discussion. We assessed risk of bias using the Cochrane 'Risk of bias' tool. We assessed the certainty of the evidence using the GRADE approach.\nMAIN RESULTS: In this review update, we screened 722 records, selected 26 full-text reports for evaluation. We identified no ongoing studies and did not add any new studies. We included three randomised controlled trials (RCTs), enrolling 211 people with hypertension or prehypertension, plus hyperuricaemia. Low-certainty evidence from three RCTs found inconclusive results between those who received UA-lowering drugs and placebo, in 24-hour ambulatory systolic (MD -6.2 mmHg, 95% CI -12.8 to 0.5) or diastolic BP (-3.9 mmHg, 95% CI -9.2 to 1.4). Low-certainty evidence from two RCTs found that UA-lowering drugs reduced clinic-measured systolic BP (-8.43 mmHg, 95% CI -15.24 to -1.62) but results for clinic-measured diastolic BP were inconclusive (-6.45 mmHg, 95% CI -13.60 to 0.70). High-certainty evidence from three RCTs found that serum UA levels were reduced by 3.1 mg\/dL (95% CI 2.4 to 3.8) in the participants that received UA-lowering drugs. Low-certainty evidence from three RCTs found inconclusive results regarding the occurrence of adverse events between those who received UA-lowering drugs and placebo (RR 1.86, 95% CI 0.43 to 8.10).\nAUTHORS' CONCLUSIONS: In this updated Cochrane Review, the current RCT data are insufficient to know whether UA-lowering therapy lowers BP. More studies are needed.",

Serum uric acid (UA) is a terminal metabolite of purine compound, while hyperuricemia (HU) and UA crystals are recognized causes of gout. Several studies have investigated the correlations between HU, gout and OA, but the findings are inconclusive. We are also concerned whether the urate lowering therapy (ULT) can become a potential treatment for OA and intend to undertake this meta-analysis to clarify the related hypotheses.\nMETHODS: Systematic literature search will be conducted on PubMed, Embase, and Web of Science to identify relevant studies up to February 2020 using appropriate search strategies. All citations and abstracts retrieved from literature search will be assessed by two reviewers independently. The Newcastle-Ottawa Scale or the Cochrane risk of bias assessment tool will be used as appropriate to assess the quality and the risk of bias of the included studies. The heterogeneity and the publication bias of the studies will be investigated accordingly.\nRESULTS: We propose to undertake this meta-analysis as a feasible approach to clarify the associations between HU, gout or ULT, and OA.\nDISCUSSIONS: This meta-analysis will help to strengthen our knowledge of the pathogenesis of OA and promote the development of preventive or treatment strategies.\nREGISTRATION: PROSPERO registration number CRD42020168769.",

Patients were divided into subgroups based on >30 continuous days of allopurinol, versus no allopurinol. New diagnoses of diabetes, defined according to American Diabetes Association diagnostic criteria or clinical documentation explicitly stating a new diagnosis of diabetes, were identified during an observation period from January 1, 2000 through December 31, 2015.Six hundred six gout patients used allopurinol >30 continuous days, and 478 patients never used allopurinol. Over an average 7.9 ± 4.8 years of follow-up, there was no significant difference in diabetes incidence between the allopurinol and non-allopurinol groups (11.7\/1000 person-years vs 10.0\/1000 person-years, P = .27). A lower diabetes incidence in the longest versus shortest quartiles of allopurinol use (6.3 per 1000 person-years vs 19.4 per 1000 person-years, P<.0001) was attributable to longer duration of medical follow-up.In this study, allopurinol use was not associated with decreased diabetes incidence. Prospective studies may further elucidate the relationship between hyperuricemia, gout, xanthine oxidase activity, and diabetes, and the potential impact of gout treatments on diabetes incidence.",

        "Abstract":"Hyperuricemia is mainly the result of relative underexcretion of urate. Urate is mainly eliminated by kidney and several important transporters expressed on the membrane of renal tubular cells involved in urate excretion. Olsalazine sodium was screened from 3167 authorized small compounds\/drugs, targeting xanthine oxidoreductase. In previous study, we reported that olsalazine sodium significantly reduced the serum urate levels, and the anti-hyperuricemic activity linked with inhibiting urate formation by reducing the activity of xanthine oxidoreductase. The current research aimed to assess olsalazine sodium renal urate excretion and likely molecular mechanism. The results showed that administration of olsalazine sodium 5.0 mg\/kg decreased the levels of serum urate in hyperuricemic rats, and noticeably improved the fractional excretion of urate and urate clearance, exhibiting an uricosuric action. Moreover, olsalazine sodium (2.5, 5.0, 10.0 mg\/kg) reduced the level of blood urea nitrogen in rats. Further study showed that olsalazine sodium reduced the mRNA expression of urate reabsorptive transporter glucose transporter 9 (GLUT9), increased the mRNA expression of urate secretory transporters, organic anion transporter 1 (OAT1), OAT3 and type 1 sodium-dependent phosphate transporter (NPT1) as well as the protein expression of OAT3 in the kidney in hyperuricemic mice. In conclusion, olsalazine sodium exhibited a promotion of urate excretion in kidney by increasing the expression of OAT3.",

NSAID\/cox-inhibitors, colchicine and glucocorticoids are all valid short-term treatments of gout attacks.

In the present study, the effects of LC-treated water (LC water) on the concentration of serum uric acid (SUA) and the hemorheological parameters in male rats with hyperuricemia (HUA) was assessed. To prepare LC water, distilled water was mixed with LC particles. HUA was induced in rats by daily potassium oxonate (PO) injection (250 mg\/kg). The PO-injected rats were separated into three different groups and were administered distilled water (PO rats), allopurinol [a xanthine oxidase (XOD) inhibitor] solution [PO + allopurinol (AP) rats] or LC water (PO+LC rats) by gavage. Control rats were intraperitoneally injected with sodium carboxymethyl cellulose solution and administered untreated distilled water by gavage. After injection and gavage for 5 weeks, the SUA concentration, hemorheology index and antioxidant index were measured. The SUA concentration and blood deformation index of the PO rats were significantly higher and lower, respectively, compared with the control rats. However, in the PO+LC rats, the SUA concentration and blood deformation index decreased and increased, respectively, to a level similar to that of the control as well as that in the PO+AP rats. Furthermore, the PO-induced increase in XOD activity was suppressed by combined treatment with LC water, resulting in a decrease in malondialdehyde concentration. These results suggest that LC water can reduce the SUA concentration, increase serum antioxidant activity and improve hemorheological activity in hyperuricemic rats.",

        "Abstract":"OBJECTIVE: To determine the feasibility and validity of using wearable activity trackers to test associations between gout flares with physical activity and sleep.\nMETHODS: Participants with physician-diagnosed gout, hyperuricemia (≥ 6.8 mg\/dl), current smartphone use, and ≥ 2 self-reported flares in the previous 6 months were enrolled. Physical activity, heart rate, and sleep data were obtained from wearable activity trackers (Fitbit Charge HR2). Daily compliance was defined by the availability of sufficiently complete activity data at least 80% of the day. Associations of weekly gout flares with sleep and activity were measured by comparing flare-related values to average sleep and steps per day. We used mixed linear models to account for repeated observations.\nRESULTS: Forty-four participants enrolled; 33 met the criteria for minimal wear time and flare reporting, with activity tracker data available for 60.5% of all total study days. Mean ± SD age was 48.8 ± 14.9 years; 85% were men; 15% were black; 88% were on allopurinol or febuxostat, and 30% reported ≥ 6 flares in the prior 6 months. Activity trackers captured 204 (38%) person-weeks with flares and 340 (62%) person-weeks without flares. Mean ± SD daily step count was significantly lower (p < 0.0001) during weeks with gout flares (5900 ± 4071) than during non-flare periods (6972 ± 5214); sleep however did not differ.\nCONCLUSION: The pattern of wear in this study illustrates reasonable feasibility of using such devices in future arthritis research. The use of these devices to passively measure changes in physical activity patterns may provide an estimate of gout flare occurrence and duration.\nTRIAL REGISTRATION: NCT, NCT02855437 .

        "Abstract":"INTRODUCTION: Uric acid is the final byproduct of purine metabolism. The loss of the enzyme that hydrolyzes uric acid to allantoin was lost, leading to a decrease in uric acid excretion and its further accumulation. The buildup of uric acid leads to damage in different organ systems, including the cardiovascular system. With the increasing burden of cardiovascular disease worldwide, a growing body of evidence has addressed the relationship between urate, cardiovascular outcomes, and gout medication cardiovascular safety.  We discuss the most common gout therapies used for the reduction of serum urate and management of gout flares in different observational and clinical trials and their effects on different aspects of cardiovascular disease. We selected the most representative clinical studies that evaluated cardiovascular outcomes with each gout therapy as well as recommendation given by the most representative guidelines from Rheumatology societies for the management of gout.\nEXPERT OPINION: The treatment of gout reduces joint damage and it can also lessen CV morbidity. Allopurinol shows CV safety profile when compared to other ULTs. Evidence supporting CV safety with the use of colchicine and IL-1 agents is promising and research needs to be conducted to further assess this outcome.",

        "Abstract":"INTRODUCTION: At Wake Forest Baptist Health, an adult tumor lysis syndrome pocket card was created in order to optimize management of tumor lysis syndrome and outline specific recommendations for the use of rasburicase. Due to the increased use of rasburicase at our institution and its cost, the purpose of this study was to evaluate the utilization of rasburicase for the management of tumor lysis syndrome in pediatric and adult patients in the inpatient and outpatient settings.\nMETHODS: This was an observational, single-center, non-randomized, retrospective chart review conducted between September 2018 and August 2019. The primary objective was to evaluate the utilization of rasburicase and appropriateness for the management of tumor lysis syndrome in pediatric and adult patients based on the Wake Forest Baptist Health tumor lysis syndrome pocket card. The secondary objectives were to assess response to prophylactic and treatment doses of rasburicase and to quantify drug cost versus expense of rasburicase utilization.\nRESULTS: Overall, 64 patients (57 adults and 7 pediatric patients) were included in the study. Rasburicase use for tumor lysis syndrome indication adhered to the pocket card 64% of the time. Appropriate fluids and\/or allopurinol were initiated in only 34% of patients. For monitoring, 80% of patients had all necessary tumor lysis syndrome laboratory values collected after rasburicase administration. All 11 patients (17%) who received rasburicase in the outpatient setting did not have follow-up labs collected. Of the patients who had tumor lysis syndrome laboratory values collected post rasburicase, 39% were appropriately timed to accurately assess efficacy of rasburicase with the median time of laboratory monitoring after rasburicase being 6.5 h. Response was observed with rasburicase 3 mg (92%), 6 mg (100%), and weight-based dosing (100%). The wholesale acquisition cost per patient was $5203 (1101-10,406). The potential cost savings of using the 3 mg dose versus the 6 mg dose for the patients who did not meet tumor lysis syndrome treatment recommendations based on the Wake Forest Baptist Health pocket card was estimated to be $36,419.46.\nCONCLUSION: There are several opportunities for improvement in tumor lysis syndrome management and rasburicase utilization at our institution. This study will lead to the implementation of formal restrictions for rasburicase use and selection of rasburicase dose. Updating the rasburicase order panel to include appropriate prophylaxis and require input of uric acid level, populating pertinent tumor lysis syndrome laboratory values on the order verification screen for pharmacists to appropriately assess if rasburicase meets the institution restriction criteria, and providing education to providers on the appropriate ordering and timing of labs.",

        "Published":null,
        "Abstract":"Xanthine oxidase (EC 1.17.3.2) (XO) is one of the main enzymatic sources that create reactive oxygen species (ROS) in the living system. It is a dehydrogenase enzyme that performs electron transfer to nicotinamide adenine dinucleotide (NAD+), while oxidizing hypoxanthin, which is an intermediate compound in purine catabolism, first to xanthine and then to uric acid. XO turns into an oxidant enzyme that oxidizes thiol groups under certain stress conditions in the tissue. The last metabolic step, in which hypoxanthin turns into uric acid, is catalyzed by XO. Uric acid, considered a waste product, can cause kidney stones and gouty-type arthritis as it is crystallized, when present in high concentrations. Thus, XO inhibitors are one of the drug classes used against gout, a purine metabolism disease that causes urate crystal storage in the joint and its surroundings caused by hyperuricemia. Urate-lowering therapy includes XO inhibitors that reduce uric acid production as well as uricosuric drugs that increase urea excretion. Current drugs that obstruct uric acid synthesis through XO inhibition are allopurinol, febuxostat, and uricase. However, since the side effects, safety and tolerability problems of some current gout medications still exist, intensive research is ongoing to look for new, effective, and safer XO inhibitors of natural or synthetic origins for the treatment of the disease. In the present review, we aimed to assess in detail XO inhibitory capacities of pure natural compounds along with the extracts from plants and other natural sources via screening Pubmed, Web of Science (WoS), Scopus, and Google Academic. The data pointed out to the fact that natural products, particularly phenolics such as flavonoids (quercetin, apigenin, and scutellarein), tannins (agrimoniin and ellagitannin), chalcones (melanoxethin), triterpenes (ginsenoside Rd and ursolic acid), stilbenes (resveratrol and piceatannol), alkaloids (berberin and palmatin) have a great potential for new XO inhibitors capable of use against gout disease. In addition, not only plants but other biological sources such as microfungi, macrofungi, lichens, insects (silk worms, ants, etc) seem to be the promising sources of novel XO inhibitors.",

        "Published":null,
        "Abstract":"Spontaneous tumor lysis syndrome (SPTLS) is a rare phenomenon that can manifest in rapidly proliferating hematological malignancies and solid tumors prior to initiating cytotoxic therapy. We encountered a patient who originally presented with diffuse lymphadenopathy, abdominal distention, and dyspnea, who had laboratory abnormalities suggestive of SPTLS. His peripheral flow cytometry and lymph node biopsy revealed blastoid-variant mantle cell lymphoma. Prior to initiating chemotherapy, acute kidney injury (AKI) and uric acid had improved with intravenous fluids and the initiation of allopurinol. However, after beginning chemotherapy, the patient developed a second AKI concerning for tumor lysis syndrome (TLS). He went on to have renal recovery and did not require renal replacement therapy. With the exception of case reports, there is limited evidence to guide general medicine clinicians who encounter cases of SPTLS. Expert-based guidelines are available to guide use of rasburicase, an uricase enzyme, before initiation of chemotherapy for certain malignancies when risk for TLS is considered high. Despite these guidelines, the role of rasburicase in preventing AKI remains controversial after inconclusive results in a meta-analysis. The causative relationship between uric acid and AKI in TLS is based on a mechanism of tubular obstruction. There are also mechanisms by which uric acid may cause AKI without tubular obstruction related to acute hyperuricemic nephropathy. Further characterization of the role of uric acid in causing AKI in patients without tubular obstruction may identify new mechanisms of injury and offer insight into new treatment strategies.",

Patients were then divided into treatment group and control group according to the random number table method. All the patients received low purine diet, renin-angiotensin-aldosterone system (RAAS) inhibitors, and adequate routine hypoglycemic treatment. Febuxostat was employed only in the treatment group. The levels of blood uric acid (sUA), serum creatinine (Scr), cystatin C (cys-c), eGFR, 24-hour urine protein quantification, albuminuria, and creatinine ratio (ACR) were evaluated in all patients before and after treatment at 4, 8, 12, and 24 week.\nRESULTS: No difference was found before treatment between the two groups. After treatment at 4, 8, 12, and 24 week, the levels of sUA, SCr, cys-c, and eGFR between the two groups were significant different (P<0.05). There was no difference in 24-hour urine protein quantification, albuminuria, and creatinine ratio between two groups before treatment, and significant differences were observed after treatment. Fifty percent of patients from the treatment group achieved the treatment goal with 20 mg febuxostat at 4 weeks. Tubular markers were also decreased with the treatment.\nCONCLUSIONS: Febuxostat can reduce uric acid and improve renal function effectively in patients with CKD stage 3 diabetic nephropathy, while being well tolerated.

        "Abstract":"Increased uric acid levels have been known to be associated with different cardiovascular and renal diseases. Over the past few years, several studies have examined the role of urate-lowering therapy (ULT) in hypertension and major adverse cardiac events (MACE) and suggest a potential role of elevated serum uric acid as an independent cardiovascular risk factor. This meta-analysis was done to determine the association of 2 ULTs commonly used in clinical practice (febuxostat vs. allopurinol) on hypertension and MACE and resolve the conflicting results of the outcomes of earlier studies. Randomized controlled trials comparing febuxostat versus allopurinol published with outcomes on blood pressure, all-cause mortality, myocardial infarction (MI), and stroke were searched through PubMed, Google Scholar, and Cochrane database. A total of 10 studies were subsequently included in the meta-analysis. Pooled analysis of the mean differences (MD) were done for the outcomes on blood pressure (systolic and diastolic) and risk ratios (RRs) for the outcomes on MACE with corresponding 95% confidence intervals (CIs). Pooled analysis of studies on hyperuricemic patients showed that febuxostat 40 mg has no significant difference compared with allopurinol 100\/300 mg with respect to diastolic (MD, -0.56 with 95% CI of -4.28 to 3.15) and systolic blood pressure (MD, 0.30 with 95% CI of -3.33 to 3.93). No significant differences were also noted on all-cause mortality (RR, 1.18 with 95% CI of 0.99-1.41), MI (RR, 0.92 with 95% CI of 0.72-1.18), and stroke (RR, 1.05 with 95% CI of 0.77-1.43). The results of this meta-analysis showed that the 2 ULTs (febuxostat vs. allopurinol) have no significant association with respect to blood pressure among adult patients with hyperuricemia.

        "Published":"2020-07-13",
        "Abstract":"Gout is the most common form of inflammatory arthritis in men, yet both patients and the public often do not recognise gout as a form of arthritis. Instead, due to historical misconceptions, gout is typically seen as a lifestyle disease caused by poor diet. In reality, there are a number of risk factors that contribute to gout, including genetic factors. Views of gout as precipitated by lifestyle alone can lead to stigma, and maladaptive beliefs that it should be treated primarily through dietary changes. This is thought to contribute to poor uptake of, and adherence to, effective pharmaceutical treatments. Gout has some of the poorest medication adherence rates of any chronic disease, contributing to suboptimal health outcomes for patients. Recent research suggests that when gout is referred to as 'urate crystal arthritis' (a rarely used name for gout), the perception of the disease by members of the public was more accurate. It was viewed as being less under personal control (i.e. less appropriately managed by behaviours such as dietary intake), and more appropriately managed by long-term medical treatment. This finding raises the possibility that patients themselves might also benefit from gout being explicitly labelled as arthritis. Indeed, parallels can be drawn between this case and other diseases that have recently had their names changed to improve outcomes, namely primary biliary cirrhosis and schizophrenia. A movement away from the term gout may benefit those living with the disease by changing illness perceptions and increasing uptake of, and adherence to, guideline-recommended treatment(s).",

        "Abstract":"OBJECTIVES: To assess the efficacy and safety of the commonly used urate-lowering therapies (ULTs): febuxostat, allopurinol, and lesinurad in hyperuricemic patients with gout.\nMETHODS: We included all randomized controlled trials (RCTs) that compared ULTs with placebo or head to head. The primary efficacy endpoint was the proportion of subjects achieving the target serum urate (SU) level at month 6. Safety outcomes included total adverse events (AEs), serious AEs, withdrawals due to AEs, and AEs per organ system. A Bayesian network model was used to compare all ULTs with placebo and among themselves.\nRESULTS: Fifteen RCTs were included for the analysis, in which 7968 patients were randomly assigned to take either placebo or one of 11 ULTs: allopurinol, febuxostat 40\/80\/120\/240 mg\/day, lesinurad 400 mg\/day, lesinurad 200\/400\/600 mg\/day plus allopurinol, and lesinurad 200\/400 mg\/day plus febuxostat. All ULTs were effective in achieving the target SU level at month 6 compared with placebo (ORs between 26.81 and 1928). Febuxostat 80\/120\/240 mg\/day was superior to allopurinol and well tolerated for urate reduction. And as febuxostat dosage increased, more patients achieved the target SU level. Furthermore, the lesinurad combination with xanthine oxidase inhibitor (XOI) groups had a higher proportion of patients achieving the target SU level than the febuxostat 40 mg\/day group (ORs between 2.89 and 9.17), the allopurinol group (ORs between 3.56 and 11.27), or the lesinurad 400 mg\/day monotherapy group (ORs between 12.30 and 39.17) but might have a high risk of AEs.\nCONCLUSIONS: All ULTs are effective in achieving the target SU level compared with placebo in hyperuricemic patients with gout. Lesinurad in combination with febuxostat or allopurinol is effective in urate lowering, especially for patients with inadequate response to XOI monotherapy. Key Points • All urate-lowering therapies (ULTs) were effective in achieving the target serum urate (SU) level at month 6 compared with placebo in hyperuricemic patients with gout. • Febuxostat 80\/120\/240 mg\/day was superior to allopurinol and well tolerated for urate reduction.

        "Abstract":"BACKGROUND: Patients with gout have arterial dysfunction and systemic inflammation, even during intercritical episodes, which may be markers of future adverse cardiovascular outcomes. We conducted a prospective observational study to assess whether initiating guideline-concordant gout therapy with colchicine and a urate-lowering xanthine oxidase inhibitor (XOI) improves arterial function and reduces inflammation.\nMETHODS: Thirty-eight untreated gout patients meeting American College of Rheumatology (ACR)\/European League Against Rheumatism classification criteria for gout and ACR guidelines for initiating urate-lowering therapy (ULT) received colchicine (0.6 mg twice daily, or once daily for tolerance) and an XOI (allopurinol or febuxostat) titrated to ACR guideline-defined serum urate (sU) target. Treatment was begun during intercritical periods. The initiation of colchicine and XOI was staggered to permit assessment of a potential independent effect of colchicine. Brachial artery flow-mediated dilation (FMD) and nitrate-mediated dilation (NMD) assessed endothelium-dependent and endothelium-independent (smooth muscle) arterial responsiveness, respectively. High-sensitivity C-reactive protein (hsCRP), IL-1β, IL-6, myeloperoxidase (MPO) concentrations, and erythrocyte sedimentation rate (ESR) assessed systemic inflammation.\nRESULTS: Four weeks after achieving target sU concentration on colchicine plus an XOI, FMD was significantly improved (58% increase, p = 0.03). hsCRP, ESR, IL-1β, and IL-6 also all significantly improved (30%, 27%, 19.5%, and 18.8% decrease respectively; all p ≤ 0.03). Prior to addition of XOI, treatment with colchicine alone resulted in smaller numerical improvements in FMD, hsCRP, and ESR (20.7%, 8.9%, 13% reductions, respectively; all non-significant), but not IL-1β or IL-6. MPO and NMD did not change with therapy. We observed a moderate inverse correlation between hsCRP concentration and FMD responsiveness (R = - 0.41, p = 0.01). Subgroup analyses demonstrated improvement in FMD after achieving target sU concentration in patients without but not with established cardiovascular risk factors and comorbidities, particularly hypertension and hyperlipidemia.\nCONCLUSIONS: Initiating guideline-concordant gout treatment reduces intercritical systemic inflammation and improves endothelial-dependent arterial function, particularly in patients without established cardiovascular comorbidities.",

        "Abstract":"The improvement and maintenance of enzymatic activities represent major challenges. However, to address these we developed novel biomimetic polysaccharide hyaluronan (Hn)-cloaked lipidic nanovesicles (BHLN) and microassemblies (BHLNM) as enzyme carriers that function by entrapping enzymes in the core or by tethering them to the inner\/outer surfaces via covalent interactions. The effectiveness of these enzyme carriers was demonstrated through an evaluation of the enzymatic activity and anti-hyperuricemia bioactivity of urate oxidase (also called uricase, Uase). We showed that Uase was effectively loaded within the BHLN\/BHLNM (UHLN\/UHLNM) and maintained good enzymatic bioactivity through a range of effects, including isolation from the external environment due to the vesicle-carrying (shielding effect), avoidance of recognition by the reticuloendothelial system due to Hn-cloaking (long-term effect), production of beneficial conformational changes (allosteric effect) due to a favorable internal microenvironment of construction and vesicle loading, and stabilization due to the reversible conjugation of Uase or vesicle and serum albumin (deposit effect). UHLN\/UHLNM had significantly increased bioavailability (∼533% and ∼331% compared to Uase) and demonstrated greatly improved efficacy, whereby the time required for UHLN\/UHLNM to lower the plasma uric acid concentration to a normal level was much shorter than that for free Uase. The interactions of the therapeutic enzyme (Uase), biomimetic membrane components (Hn and phospholipid), and serum albumin were investigated with a fluorescent probe and computational simulations to help understand the superior properties of UHLN\/UHLNM.",

        "Abstract":"BACKGROUND AND OBJECTIVES: Topiroxostat, a selective xanthine oxidoreductase inhibitor, is used for the management of hyperuricemic patients with or without gout in Japan. Accumulating evidence has demonstrated the efficacy of topiroxostat for the treatment of hyperuricemia with or without gout. However, the safety and efficacy of topiroxostat in the clinical setting remain unclear, and there is little large-scale clinical evidence. We conducted a post-marketing observational study over 54 weeks.\nPATIENTS AND METHODS: Patients were centrally enrolled, and case report forms of 4491 patients were collected between April 2014 and March 2019 from 825 medical sites.\nRESULTS: Overall, 4329 patients were assessed for safety and 4253 patients for effectiveness. The overall incidence of adverse drug reactions was 6.95%, and the incidence rates of adverse drug reactions of gouty arthritis, hepatic dysfunction, and skin disorders, which are of special interest in this study, were 0.79%, 1.73%, and 0.95%, respectively. No case of serious gouty arthritis was observed. Serum urate levels decreased stably over time and showed a significant reduction rate at 54 weeks (21.19% ± 22.07%) and on the final visit (19.91% ± 23.35%) compared to the baseline. The rates for subjects who achieved serum uric acid levels ≤ 6.0 mg\/dL at 18 and 54 weeks after administration were 43.80% and 48.28%, respectively.\nCONCLUSIONS: This study suggests that there is no particular concern about adverse drug reactions or the efficacy of topiroxostat for hyperuricemic patients with or without gout in a post-marketing setting in Japan.",

        "Published":null,
        "Abstract":"Gout is currently the most frequent cause of inflammatory arthritis worldwide. It results from elevated serum urate and subsequent deposition of monosodium urate crystals in joints and other tissues. While many patients with gout can be managed with conventional agents (e.g., allopurinol, febuxostat), those with chronic refractory gout often fail to achieve treatment goals with these agents. Pegloticase is a recombinant, pegylated mammalian uricase developed for treatment of chronic refractory gout. Pegloticase is different than other urate lowering therapies in that it enzymatically degrades urate. Pegloticase has been evaluated in multiple studies, most importantly in two randomized controlled trials and a follow-up open-label extension. Extensive analysis of results from these studies has shown that pegloticase profoundly lowers serum urate, resolves tophi, reduces tender and swollen joint counts, decreases pain, and improves both patients' global assessments and quality of life. Pegloticase also significantly decreases blood pressure in patients with chronic refractory gout, but has no significant effect on renal function. Post hoc analyses of clinical results also indicated that chronic refractory gout patients not achieving sustained urate lowering still have significant clinical benefits with pegloticase treatment. The major limitation of pegloticase is immunogenicity and the emergence of anti-drug antibodies that result in increased drug clearance, loss of efficacy, and infusion reactions. However, these reactions can be avoided by stopping pegloticase when there is a loss of serum urate lowering. New dosing regimens and co-administration of immunosuppressive agents are also being employed to overcome this limitation and extend the benefits of pegloticase to a larger number of patients.",

AHF patients were divided into 3 groups according to the plasma XOR quartiles (Q1 = low-XOR group [n = 57], Q2\/Q3 = middle-XOR group [n = 115], and Q4 = high-XOR group [n = 57]). The prognostic nutritional index (PNI) and the controlling nutritional status (CONUT) score were evaluated.\nRESULTS: The multivariate logistic regression model showed that the nutritional status (PNI: OR 1.044, 95% CI 1.000-1.088; CONUT: OR 3.805, 95% CI 1.158-12.498), age, and serum creatinine level were independently associated with a low plasma XOR activity. The Kaplan-Meier curve showed a significantly lower incidence of heart failure events in the low-XOR group than in the middle + high-XOR group (hazard ratio, HR 1.648, 95% CI 1.061-2.559). In particular, a low XOR activity with an increased serum creatinine level (>1.21 mg\/dL) was independently associated with heart failure events (HR 1.937, 95% CI 1.199-3.130).\nCONCLUSION: A low plasma XOR activity was associated with malnutrition, renal dysfunction, and aging in AHF.

This study aimed to compare febuxostat with allopurinol for uric acid reduction and renal protection in patients with CKD. Adult CKD patients newly treated with ULT were identified using electronic health records from 2010 to 2015 from a large healthcare delivery system in Taiwan. Patients with renal replacement therapy or undergoing ULT for <3 months were excluded. Propensity score-matched cohort study design was conducted to compare outcomes between patients initiated with febuxostat or allopurinol therapy. Cox regression analyses were employed to compare the adjusted hazards ratio (aHR) of incident event of estimated glomerular filtration rate (eGFR) ≥ 30% decrease, and the difference in longitudinal changes in serum uric acid (SUA) and eGFR between groups was analyzed using linear mixed model. Overall, 1050 CKD patients who initiated febuxostat (n = 525) or allopurinol (n = 525) treatment were observed for 2.5 years. Compared with allopurinol, febuxostat use was associated with higher rate of patients maintaining SUA target <6 mg\/dL in >80% of follow-up time with a reduction in mean SUA change. There were no significant differences in the mean eGFR changes over time between the febuxostat and allopurinol groups or in the risk of eGFR decline ≥30% of baseline. Febuxostat was associated with greater reduction in SUA level than allopurinol in patients with CKD. However, febuxostat and allopurinol showed no difference in renal function changes during study follow-up. These findings require further investigation with long-term follow up in CKD patients with hyperuricemia.",

The patients were categorized according to prescription of allopurinol or febuxostat. Demographic data, comorbidities, concomitant medications, gout-related clinical parameters, and the laboratory results were collected. The serial serum urate (sUA) levels were recorded at the beginning of the treatment (baseline), and after treatment at 12 weeks, 18 weeks, and 27 weeks. The primary efficacy endpoint was the achievement of target urate of < 6 mg\/dl in people taking febuxostat, compared with those taking allopurinol. The secondary endpoints were the predictive factors of achieving target urate level and adverse drug reactions in patients taking febuxostat. Multivariable regression analysis was used to determine factors associated with achieving target serum urate.\nRESULTS: After the treatment, the febuxostat groups had significantly lower mean sUA compared with the allopurinol groups across all follow-up periods. The proportion of people who achieved target serum urate was also higher in the febuxostat groups compared with the allopurinol groups throughout the follow-up periods. The multivariable regression analysis showed that febuxostat 40 mg (OR = 10.96 (95% CI 4.32-27.80); p value < 0.001), febuxostat 80 mg (OR = 9.54 (95% CI 3.91-23.28), smoking (OR = 2.35 (95% CI 1.13-4.91); p value = 0.023), and low baseline serum urate (OR = 0.62 (95% CI 0.52-0.74); p value < 0.001) were associated with the achievement of target serum urate. No adverse drug reaction from febuxostat was observed even among people with renal insufficiency.\nCONCLUSION: In a Thai cohort, people receiving febuxostat are more likely to achieve target serum urate level, compared with people receiving allopurinol. Febuxostat (40 or 80 mg), smoking, and low baseline serum urate were associated with the achievement of target serum urate.\nKEY POINTS: • Febuxostat showed superior urate-lowering efficacy compared with allopurinol in an Asian population. • In addition to febuxostat, lower baseline serum urate level and history of smoking were associated with achieving target serum urate in gout patients.",

A composite means to assess the impact of therapy on numerous aspects of gout could be useful.\nMETHODS: Results from patients treated with pegloticase or placebo in two randomized clinical trials and their open-label extension were assessed using a novel evidence-based Gout Multivariable Improvement Measure (GMIM) derived from previously reported criteria for remission and complete response. Improvement was defined as serum urate (sU) < 6 mg\/dL and absence of flares during the preceding 3 months plus 20, 50, and 70% improvement in tophus size, patient global assessment, pain, and swollen and tender joints.\nRESULTS: Patients treated with pegloticase manifested a significantly greater GMIM20, 50, and 70 response vs those treated with placebo (GMIM20 at 6 months 37.1% vs 0%, respectively). Higher response rates were significantly more frequent in subjects with persistent urate lowering (GMIM 58.1% at 6 months) in response to pegloticase versus those with only transient urate lowering (GMIM 7.1% at 6 months). However, when the requirement for a decrease in sU to < 6 mg\/dL was omitted, a substantial percentage of subjects with transient urate lowering met the GMIM clinical criteria. A sensitivity analysis indicated that gout flares contributed minimally to the model. The response measured by GMIM persisted into the open-level extension for as long as 2 years. Finally, subjects who received placebo in the randomized control trials, but pegloticase in the open-label extension, manifested GMIM responses comparable to that noted with pegloticase-treated subjects in the randomized controlled trials.\nCONCLUSIONS: GMIM captures changes in disease activity in response to treatment with pegloticase and may serve as an evidence-based tool for assessment of responses to other urate-lowering therapies in gout patients.",

This study aimed to determine a formula that predicts the effective dose of febuxostat in patients with an estimated glomerular filtration rate (eGFR) < 60 mL\/min and asymptomatic hyperuricemia.\nMATERIALS AND METHODS: This is a retrospective analysis of 100 CKD patients treated with febuxostat for asymptomatic hyperuricemia in two private Lebanese clinics. Patients with gout were excluded. Collected variables were age, sex, weight, serum creatinine, serum uric acid (sUA) before and after febuxostat, dose of febuxostat used, and diuretic use. Multiple regression analysis was used to derive a formula predicting the dose of febuxostat based on eGFR (2009 Chronic Kidney Disease Epidemiology Collaboration equation), baseline sUA, and sUA reduction ratio. A prospective cohort of 24 patients was then used to validate the derived model.\nRESULTS: 100 patients were included with a median age of 71.5 years (interquartile range (IQR), 64.2 - 79.0); 69% were men. Median baseline sUA was 9.1 mg\/dL (IQR, 8.4 - 10.1). Mean eGFR was 31.80 ± 12.96 mL\/min\/1.73m. Of the included patients, 18% had CKD stage 3a, 36% had CKD stage 3b, 38% had CKD stage 4, and 8% had non-dialysis CKD stage 5. A formula was computed to predict febuxostat dosing. Variables that were predictive of febuxostat dose and used in the final equation were eGFR, diuretic use, baseline sUA, and sUA reduction ratio. The validation cohort showed no significant difference between the expected sUA and the measured one (p = 0.16).\nCONCLUSION: With this new formula, physicians can initiate febuxostat in CKD patients at an effective dose for any desired sUA reduction ratio.",

Whether urate-lowering treatment with allopurinol can attenuate the decline of the estimated glomerular filtration rate (eGFR) in patients with chronic kidney disease who are at risk for progression is not known.\nMETHODS: In this randomized, controlled trial, we randomly assigned adults with stage 3 or 4 chronic kidney disease and no history of gout who had a urinary albumin:creatinine ratio of 265 or higher (with albumin measured in milligrams and creatinine in grams) or an eGFR decrease of at least 3.0 ml per minute per 1.73 m of body-surface area in the preceding year to receive allopurinol (100 to 300 mg daily) or placebo. The primary outcome was the change in eGFR from randomization to week 104, calculated with the Chronic Kidney Disease Epidemiology Collaboration creatinine equation.\nRESULTS: Enrollment was stopped because of slow recruitment after 369 of 620 intended patients were randomly assigned to receive allopurinol (185 patients) or placebo (184 patients). Three patients per group withdrew immediately after randomization. The remaining 363 patients (mean eGFR, 31.7 ml per minute per 1.73 m; median urine albumin:creatinine ratio, 716.9; mean serum urate level, 8.2 mg per deciliter) were included in the assessment of the primary outcome. The change in eGFR did not differ significantly between the allopurinol group and the placebo group (-3.33 ml per minute per 1.73 m per year [95% confidence interval {CI}, -4.11 to -2.55] and -3.23 ml per minute per 1.73 m per year [95% CI, -3.98 to -2.47], respectively; mean difference, -0.10 ml per minute per 1.73 m per year [95% CI, -1.18 to 0.97]; P = 0.85).

        "Abstract":"BACKGROUND: Higher serum urate levels are associated with an increased risk of diabetic kidney disease. Lowering of the serum urate level with allopurinol may slow the decrease in the glomerular filtration rate (GFR) in persons with type 1 diabetes and early-to-moderate diabetic kidney disease.\nMETHODS: In a double-blind trial, we randomly assigned participants with type 1 diabetes, a serum urate level of at least 4.5 mg per deciliter, an estimated GFR of 40.0 to 99.9 ml per minute per 1.73 m of body-surface area, and evidence of diabetic kidney disease to receive allopurinol or placebo. The primary outcome was the baseline-adjusted GFR, as measured with iohexol, after 3 years plus a 2-month washout period. Secondary outcomes included the decrease in the iohexol-based GFR per year and the urinary albumin excretion rate after washout. Safety was also assessed.\nRESULTS: A total of 267 patients were assigned to receive allopurinol and 263 to receive placebo. The mean age was 51.1 years, the mean duration of diabetes 34.6 years, and the mean glycated hemoglobin level 8.2%. The mean baseline iohexol-based GFR was 68.7 ml per minute per 1.73 m in the allopurinol group and 67.3 ml per minute per 1.73 m in the placebo group. During the intervention period, the mean serum urate level decreased from 6.1 to 3.9 mg per deciliter with allopurinol and remained at 6.1 mg per deciliter with placebo. After washout, the between-group difference in the mean iohexol-based GFR was 0.001 ml per minute per 1.73 m (95% confidence interval [CI], -1.9 to 1.9; P = 0.99). The mean decrease in the iohexol-based GFR was -3.0 ml per minute per 1.73 m per year with allopurinol and -2.5 ml per minute per 1.73 m per year with placebo (between-group difference, -0.6 ml per minute per 1.73 m per year; 95% CI, -1.5 to 0.4). The mean urinary albumin excretion rate after washout was 40% (95% CI, 0 to 80) higher with allopurinol than with placebo. The frequency of serious adverse events was similar in the two groups.\nCONCLUSIONS: We found no evidence of clinically meaningful benefits of serum urate reduction with allopurinol on kidney outcomes among patients with type 1 diabetes and early-to-moderate diabetic kidney disease.

Therefore, we compared the risks of hospitalized coronary artery disease (CAD), stroke, heart failure (HF), and all-cause mortality between ULT users and nonusers among patients with gout.\nMETHODS: We performed this retrospective cohort study using Taiwan's population-based National Health Insurance Research Database. In total, 5218 patients with gout were included from 2000 to 2012. We compared the incidence rates (IRs) of hospitalized CAD, stroke, HF, and all-cause mortality between ULT users and matched nonusers.\nRESULTS: The IRs of hospitalized stroke were 0.6 and 1.0 per 100 person-years for ULT users and nonusers, respectively, after adjusting for age, sex, residence, comorbidities, and medications. ULT users showed lower adjusted hazard ratios (aHR) for hospitalized stroke (aHR: 0.52, p < 0.001) and all-cause mortality (aHR: 0.6, p = 0.02) than nonusers. Subgroup analyses revealed that uricosuric agents and xanthine oxidase inhibitors were significantly associated with lower risks of hospitalized stroke and all-cause mortality, respectively. The effect of uricosuric agents on the decrease in hospitalized stroke risk indicated a dose-response relationship.\nCONCLUSIONS: Our study showed lower risks of hospitalized stroke and all-cause mortality in ULT users than in nonusers among patients with gout.

        "Abstract":"OBJECTIVES: The need of maintaining serum urate (SU)-lowering agents in hemodialysis (HD) patients is an understudied area that requires a review, as it is a common practice. The aims were to assess the SU reduction achieved under HD and to analyze the kinetics of SU in a week of intermittent HD.\nMETHODS: The serum urate levels were determined before and after HD sessions in 96 consecutive patients with end-stage renal disease, and the average SU reduction was assessed. Variables related to HD were analyzed whether they were associated with SU reductions of 80% greater. In addition, a kinetics study was performed on 10 selected patients with hyperuricemia (SU before HD >6.8 mg\/dL) throughout intermittent HD sessions in a 1-week period.\nRESULTS: The mean ± SD age of the patients was 66.5 ± 13.8 years, and 62 of them were male (64.6%). The mean ± SD time on HD replacement was 7.1 ± 7.2 years, and 16 (16.4%) continued with urate-lowering agents. The mean SU reduction immediately after HD was 80.2% (95% confidence interval, 78.4-82.0); 51 patients (56.7%) showed SU reduction of 80% or greater. In the SU kinetics study, SU levels significantly reduced all over the period and persisted below hyperuricemia threshold (p = 0.015). Noteworthy, 6 patients (60%) were hyperuricemic before session 1, but only 1 (10%) before session 2 and none before session 3.\nCONCLUSIONS: Under HD replacement therapy, the SU levels effectively reduced and persisted below saturation point, suggesting that the SU-lowering therapy would be unnecessary for patients on HD, but necessary in selected cases. The definition of hyperuricemia under HD needs to be revised.",

        "Abstract":"The incidence and prevalence of gout have increased, as have comorbid obesity, diabetes mellitus, hypertension, chronic kidney and cardiovascular disease. Gout is now the commonest type of inflammatory arthritis despite availability of safe, effective and potentially 'curative' urate-lowering drugs. Modern imaging studies show that gout is a chronic inflammatory crystal deposition disorder even at the first acute attack and they illuminate the need to eliminate urate crystals by continuing reduction of the serum urate below its solubility threshold. Clinical outcomes, adherence to therapy and quality of gout care in primary care and hospital practice can be greatly improved by better use of allopurinol and flare prophylaxis, greater patient engagement, education and follow-up, and by nurse-led models of care that employ a 'treat-to-target' principle (SUA< 360 or 300µmol\/l). Advances in understanding the physiology and genetic control of urate transport in the kidney and gut have led to novel, more selective uricosuric drugs, and basic research on mediators of urate crystal-induced inflammation has pointed to alternative therapeutic targets for treating and preventing gout flares. Current guidelines for the management of gout and indications for the use of some more recently introduced drugs; febuxostat, lesinurad, pegloticase and interleukin-1 antagonists are also briefly reviewed.",

        "Abstract":"Mental disorders comprise diverse human pathologies, including depression, bipolar affective disorder, schizophrenia, and dementia that affect millions of people around the world. The causes of mental disorders are unclear, but growing evidence suggests that oxidative stress and the purine\/adenosine system play a key role in their development and progression. Xanthine oxidase (XO) is a flavoprotein enzyme essential for the catalysis of the oxidative hydroxylation of purines -hypoxanthine and xanthine- to generate uric acid. As a consequence of the oxidative reaction of XO, reactive oxygen species (ROS) such as superoxide and hydrogen peroxide are produced and, further, contribute to the pathogenesis of mental disorders. Altered XO activity has been associated with free radical-mediated neurotoxicity inducing cell damage and inflammation. Diverse studies reported a direct association between an increased activity of XO and diverse mental diseases including depression or schizophrenia. Small-molecule inhibitors, such as the well-known allopurinol, and dietary flavonoids, can modulate the XO activity and subsequent ROS production. In the present work, we review the available literature on XO inhibition by small molecules and their potential therapeutic application in mental disorders. In addition, we discuss the chemistry and molecular mechanism of XO inhibitors, as well as the use of structure-based and computational methods to design specific inhibitors with the capability of modulating XO activity.",

        "Abstract":"BACKGROUND: Gout is a common chronic disease with a high recurrence rate. To date, the debate continues about the best time for using urate lowering therapy (ULT) during an acute gout attack.\nOBJECTIVE: This updated meta-analysis is designed to assess the clinical efficacy of ULT in the management of acute exacerbations of gout. Through the results, we hope to determine whether uric acid lowering agents should be used to manage acute exacerbations of gout.\nMETHODS: A comprehensive search of six databases without language restrictions includes PubMed, Cochrane Library, Web of Science, EMBASE, CNKI, and WanFang data. The literature used was published before October 2019. Six randomized controlled trials (RCTs) with 557 patients met the inclusion criteria. Standardized mean difference (SMD), weighted mean difference (WMD), risk ratio (RR), and 95% confidence interval (CI) were used for estimating the clinical efficacy of ULT in acute gout.\nRESULTS: Data results showed no statistical difference in the pain visual analogue score (VAS) by day 3 (weighted mean difference (WMD), 0.06; 95% CI, - 0.13 to 0.25; I 0%; P = 0.55), erythrocyte sedimentation rate (ESR) and C-reactive protein (CRP) between the group using uric acid lowering agents and the group that was not using such agents. Moreover, the patients using ULT agents had lower serum uric acid level (standardized mean difference (SMD), - 0.73; 95% CI, -0.92 to -0.54; I 23%; P < 0.00001) and showed better adherence to medication (risk ratio (RR), 1.40; 95% CI, 1.18 to 1.65; I 0%; P < 0.0001) as compared with the patients not that were not using such agents. However, there was no substantial difference in the recurrence rate of acute gout attacks (RR, 0.84; 95% CI, 0.59 to 1.19; I 0%; P = 0.33).The evidence for this is, however, very moderate.\nCONCLUSION: Our finding shows that it is beneficial in many aspects to use uric-acid-lowering drugs at the initial stage of an acute gout attack. However, larger sample size studies are still needed to prove our results.\nTRIAL REGISTRATION: Registration number: PROSPERO (CRD42020153924). Key Points • This is a first meta-analysis about the clinical efficacy of urate-lowering therapy (ULT) in acute gout without language restrictions. • ULT in acute gout may not aggravate the pain (WMD, 0.06; 95% CI, - 0.13 to 0.25). • ULT at the initial stage of an acute gout attack can reduce serum uric acid level (SMD, -0.73; 95% CI, - 0.92 to - 0.54) and improve medication compliance in patients (RR, 1.40; 95% CI, 1.18 to 1.65). • ULT in acute gout is not associated with the risk of gout flares (RR, 0.84; 95% CI, 0.59 to 1.19).",

        "Abstract":"BACKGROUND: Typical hemolytic uremic syndrome (HUS) causes acute kidney injury (AKI) and serious sequelae of chronic kidney disease (CKD) in some. Hyperuricemia is a common finding in typical HUS that may contribute to kidney damage. We explored whether aggressive management of hyperuricemia with rasburicase could improve outcomes in AKI patients with typical HUS.\nMETHODS: We retrospectively analyzed medical records of children with typical HUS admitted to a tertiary center between 2005 and 2017. We compared clinical outcomes of hospitalization and 1-year post-discharge between those with rasburicase treatment (n = 13) and those without (controls, n = 29).\nRESULTS: With rasburicase treatment, hyperuricemia corrected more rapidly (median 36 vs. 120 h, p < 0.001), and hospital stays were shorter (median 9 vs. 12 days, p = 0.003) than in the controls. There was no difference in dialysis requirement. At 1-year post-discharge, the proportion of patients with impaired kidney function (estimated glomerular filtration rate < 90 mL\/min\/1.73 m) was lower in the rasburicase group (7.7% vs. 41.4%, p = 0.036) than in the controls. Hypertension and proteinuria tended to be more common in the controls than in the rasburicase group. Collectively, long-term renal sequelae of impaired kidney function, proteinuria, or hypertension at a 1-year follow-up was less common in the rasburicase group than in the controls (7.7% vs. 62.1%; p = 0.001).\nCONCLUSIONS: Children with typical HUS treated with rasburicase had shorter hospital stays and less long-term sequelae at 1-year post-discharge than those who were not treated with rasburicase. These results support the use of rasburicase to prevent CKD in pediatric patients with typical HUS-associated AKI. Graphical Abstract.",

        "Published":null,
        "Abstract":"Hyperuricaemia (HUA) significantly increases the risk of metabolic syndrome and is strongly associated with the increased prevalence of high serum free fatty acids (FFAs) and insulin resistance. However, the underlying mechanisms are not well established, especially the effect of uric acid (UA) on adipose tissue, a vital organ in regulating whole-body energy and FFA homeostasis. In the present study, we noticed that adipocytes from the white adipose tissue of patients with HUA were hypertrophied and had decreased UCP1 expression. To test the effects of UA on adipose tissue, we built both in vitro and in vivo HUA models and elucidated that a high level of UA could induce hypertrophy of adipocytes, inhibit their hyperplasia and reduce their beige-like characteristics. According to mRNA-sequencing analysis, UA significantly decreased the expression of leptin in adipocytes, which was closely related to fatty acid metabolism and the AMPK signalling pathway, as indicated by KEGG pathway analysis. Moreover, lowering UA using benzbromarone (a uricosuric agent) or metformin-induced activation of AMPK expression significantly attenuated UA-induced FFA metabolism impairment and adipose beiging suppression, which subsequently alleviated serum FFA elevation and insulin resistance in HUA mice. Taken together, these observations confirm that UA is involved in the aetiology of metabolic abnormalities in adipose tissue by regulating leptin-AMPK pathway, and metformin could lessen HUA-induced serum FFA elevation and insulin resistance by improving adipose tissue function via AMPK activation. Therefore, metformin could represent a novel treatment strategy for HUA-related metabolic disorders.",

Medical check-ups showed 13.4% (19.6%, 1.0%) of patients with hyperuricemia (serum uric acid [sUA] > 7.0 mg\/dL). Urate-lowering therapy (ULT) was prescribed for 80.7% of patients identified with gout and 72.4% identified with asymptomatic hyperuricemia. ULT adherence was satisfactory, but most patients were treated with low-dose ULT. Less than half of patients receiving ULT achieved the sUA target (≤6.0 mg\/dL). In gout patients, the incidence of gout flare was 47.8% (0.74 flares\/person-year).\nCONCLUSIONS: Although hyperuricemia prevalence is similar in Japan and worldwide, gout is comparatively rare in Japan. Gout and asymptomatic hyperuricemia are often treated with low-dose ULT, and many patients fail to reach target sUA, suggesting that gout management is suboptimal in Japan.

Gout is more prevalent in men than in women, with increasing age, and in some ethnic groups. Despite rising prevalence and incidence, suboptimal management of gout continues in many countries. Typically, only a third to half of patients with gout receive urate-lowering therapy, which is a definitive, curative treatment, and fewer than a half of patients adhere to treatment. Many gout risk factors exist, including obesity, dietary factors and comorbid conditions. As well as a firmly established increased risk of cardiovascular disease and chronic kidney disease in those with gout, novel associations of gout with other comorbidities have been reported, including erectile dysfunction, atrial fibrillation, obstructive sleep apnoea, osteoporosis and venous thromboembolism. Discrete patterns of comorbidity clustering in individuals with gout have been described. Increasing prevalence and incidence of obesity and comorbidities are likely to contribute substantially to the rising burden of gout.",

        "Abstract":"BACKGROUND: Increasing evidence connects serum uric acid (sUA) with hypertension. Previous studies on the efficacy of febuxostat on blood pressure (BP) in hyperuricemic patients have provided conflicting results. Thus, we aim to perform a systematic review and meta-analysis to investigate the efficacy of febuxostat on BP.\nMETHODS: Five electronic databases (included The Cochrane Library, MEDLINE, Embase, Web of Science, and Cochrane Central Register of Controlled Trials) will be searched. Randomized controlled trials will be included if they recruited hyperuricemic participants for assessing the effect of febuxostat on BP versus control (placebo, no treatment, and other therapeutic agents). The primary outcome will be BP, secondary outcomes will be sUA, serum creatinine, and estimated glomerular filtration rate. Relevant literature search, data extraction, and quality assessment will be performed by 2 researchers independently, and the third researcher will be involved in a discussion for any disagreements. All analyses will be performed based on the Cochrane Handbook for Systematic Reviews of Interventions. Stata 12.0 software will be used for statistical analysis. The effect size of dichotomous data will be measured using the odds ratio , and the effect size of continuous data will be measured using the standardized mean difference. And 95% confidence intervals will be calculated. Heterogeneity will be tested by χ-based Cochran Q statistic and I statistic. Sensitivity analysis and subgroup analysis will be used to observe changes in the pooled effect size and heterogeneity between included studies, to assess the reliability and stability of the pooled results. The funnel plot and Egger's and Begg's tests will be used to judge publication bias, and the trim and fill method will be used to correct the funnel asymmetry caused by publication bias. P < .05 will be considered to indicate a statistically significant result.\nRESULTS: This systematic review and meta-analysis will be to assess the efficacy of febuxostat on BP.\nCONCLUSIONS: Our findings will show the effect of febuxostat on BP in hyperuricemic patients. And such a study may find a new therapeutic option for hypertensive patients and assist clinicians and health professionals make clinical decisions.\nETHICS AND DISSEMINATION: This study is a protocol for systematic review and meta-analysis of the effect of febuxostat on BP in hypertensive patients. This systematic review and meta-analysis will be published in a journal and disseminated in print by peer-review.\nINPLASY REGISTRATION NUMBER: INPLASY202050031.",

        "Abstract":"Tumor lysis syndrome (TLS) is a severe metabolic complication that usually occurs in patients with aggressive tumors who undergo treatment with chemotherapy. Traditionally, it was mainly associated with hematologic malignancies. However, over the past 4 decades, there have been increasing reports of TLS in solid tumors. We report a case of TLS in a patient with gastric cancer, as a complication of FOLFOX (5-fluorouracil, leucovorin, and oxaliplatin) chemotherapy. Our patient was a 48-year-old man with metastatic gastric adenocarcinoma who presented with altered mental status and slurred speech. On examination, he was confused and disoriented, but the rest of his examination, including vitals, was unremarkable. Laboratory findings on admission were significant for an elevated uric acid of 14.5 mg\/dL, creatinine of 4.1 mg\/dL, and phosphorus of 6.9 mg\/dL. He had received his first cycle of FOLFOX chemotherapy 4 days prior to admission. The constellation of electrolyte abnormalities and the temporal relationship to chemotherapy led to the diagnosis of chemotherapy-induced TLS. He was treated with aggressive fluid repletion and rasburicase, following which the electrolyte derangements resolved, and he improved clinically. This case highlights the importance of early recognition of TLS in patients with gastric cancer. Initiation of early treatment can reduce the high morbidity and mortality associated with this oncologic emergency.",

        "Published":"2020-06-07",
        "Abstract":"Hyperuricemia (HUA) is an important risk factor for renal diseases and contributes to gout. Arhalofenate (Arha) has been proved to have uricosuric activity as an inhibitor of URAT1, organic anion transporter 4 (OAT4) and OAT10. However, the effects of Arha on HUA remain unknown. The objective of this study was to investigate whether Arha could alleviate HUA and uncovered the underlying mechanism in vitro. HK-2 cells were exposed to uric acid (UA) to simulate HUA in vitro. Then cells were treated with Arha, caspase-1 inhibitor Belnacasan (Beln), caspase-11 inhibitor Wedelolactone (Wede) and PPARγ inhibitor Mifobate, respectively. The alteration of cell proliferation, inflammation, pyroptosis and expression of related proteins were detected. Results showed that UA exposure inhibited cell viability and increased IL-1β and IL-18 generation in a concentration dependent manner. Meanwhile, UA activated the cleavage of gasdermin D (GSDMD), enhanced the protein expression of URAT1, OAT4, TLR4, caspase-1, and caspase-11 and reduced PPARγ expression. While the presence of Arha or Beln enhanced cell viability and inhibited cleavage of GSDMD. Wede slightly increased cell viability but failed to prevent GSDMD cleavage. The expression of related proteins except caspase-11was also recovered by Arha. Beln and Wede partially rescued related proteins level except PPARγ compared with model group. Besides, the co-treatment of Mifobate blunted the effects of Arha on cell viability and expression of GSDMD, TLR4, and caspase-1. In conclusion, Arha inhibited UA transport as well as preventing inflammation and pyroptosis via activating PPARγ thereby blocking caspase-1 activation of HUA in vitro.",

        "Abstract":"Bartter syndrome and Gitelman syndrome (GS) are autosomal recessive disorders usually caused by homozygous or compound heterozygous mutations in causative genes. In some patients, these two syndromes cannot be discriminated based on clinical features or mutation type; thus, a single disease concept, salt-losing tubulopathies (SLTs), has been used instead. Despite the existence of several SLT causative genes, cases of digenic heterozygous mutations in two different genes are extremely rare. Here, we report the case of a 36-year-old woman with renal insufficiency and hypokalemia caused by an SLT. To evaluate the SLT phenotype, we performed next-generation sequencing (NGS) with a gene panel including SLC12A3, SLC12A1, CLCNKB, and CLCNKA as well as laboratory examinations and diuretic loading tests. The results of the diuretic loading tests were consistent with a GS phenotype, while the NGS results showed that the patient had heterozygous mutations in SLC12A1 and CLCNKB. Both genes have been associated with BS, suggesting that the SLT was caused by digenic heterozygous mutations in two different genes. To date, only a few SLT cases caused by digenic heterozygous mutations in two different genes have been reported. The digenic SLT phenotype in the patient was presumably accelerated by moderate renal insufficiency.",

ABNP formulation was prepared by employing desolvation technique, and its optimization was conducted by 2-factor-3-level central composite design (CCD) in order to achieve minimum particle size (PSA) and polydispersity index (PDI), maximum entrapment efficiency (EE), and zeta potential (ZP). Further, the optimized formulation (ABNPs) was also assessed for in vitro drug release study, TEM, DSC, XRD analysis, FTIR spectroscopy, and in vivo animal study. The in vivo study revealed that after 2 h of ABNPs administration, a significant concentration of ALLO was present in kidney (21.26-fold) as compared with serum while in case of standard pure drug group; no drug was seen in mice kidney and serum post 2 h administration, which indicates successful targeting of ALLO by formulating its albumin nanoparticles. Also, uric acid and pH levels were measured in serum and urine samples of mice which showed significant (P < 0.01) efficacy of ABNPs formulation in management of hyperuricemia-related nephrolithiasis. Histological studies on kidney samples also confirmed these outcomes. Findings of present study indicate higher kidney uptake of allopurinol from formulated ABNPs, which could be due to the specificity of albumin polymer for cubilin and megalin receptors, and it also serves as effective strategy in management of hyperuricemic-related nephrolithiasis.",

Continuous glucose monitoring system (CGMS) was used to detect the blood glucose fluctuations of these gout patients. Changes in blood glucose fluctuations after allopurinol therapy were also evaluated.\nRESULTS: Compared with the reference values of blood glucose fluctuation parameters in China, gout patients had greater glycemic fluctuations including higher mean amplitude of glucose excursions (MAGE) (4.65 vs 1.94 mmol\/L, P < .001), higher largest amplitude of blood glucose excursions (LAGE) (4.99 vs 3.72 mmol\/L, P < .001) and higher standard deviations of blood glucose (SDBG) (1.36 vs 0.79 mmol\/L, P < .001).

We protocolized dose escalation of ULT to improve gout management. The aim was to reduce time to achieve target serum urate (SU) <360 µmol\/L.\nMETHODS: Process improvement tools were used to identify underlying causes of prolonged time to target SU. We designed a nurse-led telemedicine intervention for dose escalation of ULT. Patients with gout with SU ≥360 µmol\/L meeting indications for ULT at a single institution were recruited. Exclusion criteria were estimated glomerular filtration rate <30 mL\/min, pregnancy, cognitive impairment and poor mobility. A nurse-led telemedicine clinic was set up to perform patient education, monitoring of adverse events and drug escalation. We partnered with primary healthcare centers for routine blood tests.\nRESULTS: From July 2016 to December 2017, 127 patients were recruited. Median time to target SU was 19.0 weeks (interquartile range [IQR] 11.0-31.0). Median dose of allopurinol was 300 mg\/d (IQR 200-400) in normal renal function and lower in renal impairment. Median telemedicine calls required to achieve target SU was 2 (IQR 1-3). No patient was hospitalized for gout flares. Two patients had adverse drug reactions, one required cessation of allopurinol for rash with eosinophilia, the other had self-resolving ulcers and allopurinol was continued. Lower baseline SU and number of gout flares were associated with attainment of target SU.\nCONCLUSION: A nurse-led telemedicine for gout care is effective and safe.

        "Abstract":"INTRODUCTION\/OBJECTIVES: Lifelong urate-lowering therapy (ULT) with xanthine oxidase inhibitors (XOIs), such as allopurinol and febuxostat, is the cornerstone of gout treatment. This study aimed to compare drug persistence between allopurinol and febuxostat as first-line ULT in patients with gout in real practice.\nMETHOD: In this retrospective cohort study, we evaluated 602 patients with gout in whom allopurinol or febuxostat was newly initiated from December 2011 to November 2018 at a tertiary rheumatology centre. Persistence was defined as the duration from the first description date to the end of treatment with XOIs or the end of the study period (November 2019).\nRESULTS: Among the 602 gout patients, the mean age was 60.2 years and 234 (38.9%) patients had tophi. Allopurinol and febuxostat were started in 237 (39.3%) and 365 (60.6%) patients, respectively. During the study period, 282 (46.8%) patients stopped taking XOIs, and the most common reason for XOI withdrawal was poor health literacy (61.3%). The 1- and 5-year persistence rates of XOIs were 67.2% and 40.9%, respectively. In the Kaplan-Meier analysis, persistence rates of allopurinol were significantly lower than those of febuxostat (p < 0.001). In the multivariable Cox regression model, allopurinol use was a significant risk factor for discontinuation of XOIs (HR = 2.01, p < 0.001). In addition, the presence of tophi and symptom duration < 24 months was independently associated with a higher risk of XOI withdrawal.\nCONCLUSIONS: Long-term persistence of XOIs was suboptimal, and allopurinol had worse persistence rates than febuxostat among patients with gout. Key Points • Long-term persistence of xanthine oxidase inhibitors (XOIs) as first-line urate-lowering therapy (ULT) among patients with gout was suboptimal, and the major reason for XOI discontinuation was poor health literacy in our study. • We demonstrated that allopurinol had worse persistence rates than febuxostat among patients with gout, suggesting that febuxostat is a better option for long-term ULT in light of medication adherence in a real-world setting. • Patients with gout with tophi and shorter symptom duration were found to be at high risk for poor persistence of XOIs.",

        "Published":null,
        "Abstract":"PURPOSE OF REVIEW: Uric acid is produced after purine nucleotide degradation, upon xanthine oxidase catalytic action. In the evolutionary process, humans lost uricase, an enzyme that converts uric acid into allantoin, resulting in increased serum uric acid levels that may vary according to dietary ingestion, pathological conditions, and other factors. Despite the controversy over the inflammatory role of uric acid in its soluble form, crystals of uric acid are able to activate the NLRP3 inflammasome in different tissues. Uric acid, therefore, triggers hyperuricemic-related disease such as gout, metabolic syndrome, and kidney injuries. The present review provides an overview on the role of uric acid in the inflammasome-mediated kidney damage.\nRECENT FINDINGS: Hyperuricemia is present in 20-35% of patients with chronic kidney disease. However, whether this increased circulating uric acid is a risk factor or just a biomarker of renal and cardiovascular injuries has become a topic of intense discussion. Despite these conflicting views, several studies support the idea that hyperuricemia is indeed a cause of progression of kidney disease, with a putative role for soluble uric acid in activating renal NLRP3 inflammasome, in reprograming renal and immune cell metabolism and, therefore, in promoting kidney inflammation\/injury.\nSUMMARY: Therapies aiming to decrease uric acid levels prevent renal NLRP3 inflammasome activation and exert renoprotective effects in experimental kidney diseases. However, further clinical studies are needed to investigate whether reduced circulating uric acid can also inhibit the inflammasome and be beneficial in human conditions.",

The number of gout patients seen per month was five (3-9); they were referred in 58.7% by a general practitioner. The clinical presentation of gout patients was dominated by gout crisis in 71%, and the association gout crisis and gouty arthropathy accounted for 19% of severe forms. 40% of rheumatologists apply the 2015ACR\/EULAR classification criteria. Obesity accounted for 85.7% of the associated comorbidities. The most commonly prescribed Urate-lowering therapy (ULT) was allopurinol in 81.3% (± 12). 48% of rheumatologists reported starting allopurinol at 200 mg daily and associated it with colchicine during the first 6 months by 33.3%. The determination of uric acid levels was monitoring in 76.2% every 3 months.

Xanthine oxidoreductase (XOR), the rate-limiting enzyme of purine metabolism, plays an important role in uric acid production and generates reactive oxygen species. However, the impact of plasma XOR activity on the clinical outcomes of patients with HFpEF remains unclear. The aim of this study was to investigate whether plasma XOR activity is associated with major adverse cardiovascular events (MACEs) in patients with HFpEF.\nMETHODS AND RESULTS: The plasma XOR activity was measured in 257 patients with HFpEF, who were then divided into three groups according to the activity levels: low XOR group (<33 pmol\/h\/mL, n = 45), normal XOR group (33-120 pmol\/h\/mL, n = 160), and high XOR group (>120 pmol\/h\/mL, n = 52). During the median follow-up period of 809 days, there were 74 MACEs. Kaplan-Meier analysis revealed that the high XOR group was at the highest risk for MACEs. Multivariate analysis by Cox's proportional hazard regression approach showed that high XOR activity was significantly associated with MACEs, after adjustment for confounding factors. The patients were also divided into four groups according to the absence\/presence of high XOR activity and\/or hyperuricaemia. According to the multivariate Cox regression analysis, high XOR activity was associated with MACEs, regardless of the hyperuricaemia status.\nCONCLUSIONS: Elevated plasma XOR activity is significantly associated with adverse clinical outcomes in patients with HFpEF.",

        "Abstract":"Both hypertension and hyperuricemia are closely associated with the morbidity and mortality of heart failure. This study was designed to evaluate the influences of long-term xanthine oxidase inhibitor (febuxostat) prescription on left ventricular hypertrophy (LVH), left ventricular (LV) diastolic function, and new-onset heart failure with preserved ejection fraction (HFpEF) in these patients. Using a propensity score matching of 1:2 ratio, this retrospective claims database study compared febuxosatat prescription (n = 96) and non-urate-lowering therapy (n = 192) in patients with hypertensive left ventricular hypertrophy (LVH) and asymptomatic hyperuricemia. With a follow-up of 36 months, febuxostat significantly decreased the level of serum uric acid as well as generated more prominent improvement in LVH and LV diastolic function. Besides, the new-onset symptomatic HFpEF occurred in 2 of 96 patients in febuxostat group and 13 of 192 patients in non-urate-lowering group (P = 0.091). No increased risk for major adverse cardiovascular events in patients prescribed with febuxostat was noted. In conclusion, long-term febuxostat exposure was associated with protective effects in terms of LVH or LV diastolic dysfunction in patients with hypertensive LVH and asymptomatic hyperuricemia. Febuxostat also displayed a trend for reduced risk of new-onset HFpEF in this population.",

Participants (n=35 recruited) diagnosed with chronic gout received four tablets of   daily over a 45-day period. Efficacy was assessed by changes in pain, swelling and blood uric acid levels, with concurrent safety and tolerability assessments.\nRESULTS: A total of 27 (85.2% male) participants (mean ± SD age, 54.2 ± 12.5 years; BMI, 24.2 ± 3.6 kg\/m) with gout (median [IQR], years since diagnosis 4.0 [3.0-8.0]) completed intervention. In relation to safety, there were no significant changes in vital signs, blood biochemistry or cell counts. In regard to efficacy, the degree of perceived pain and frequency of joint swelling significantly declined after 15 and 30 days of treatment, respectively, and remained so until the end of trial.

        "Abstract":"OBJECTIVE: To develop French Society of Rheumatology-endorsed recommendations for the management of urate-lowering therapy (ULT).\nMETHODS: Evidence-based recommendations were developed by 9 rheumatologists (academic or community-based), 3 general practitioners, 1 cardiologist, 1 nephrologist and 1 patient, using a systematic literature search, one physical meeting to draft recommendations and two Delphi rounds to finalize them.\nRESULTS: A set of 3 overarching principles and 5 recommendations was elaborated. The overarching principles emphasize the importance of patient education, especially the need for explaining the objective of lowering serum urate (SU) level to obtain crystal dissolution, clinical symptoms disappearance and avoidance of complications. ULT is indicated as soon as the diagnosis of gout is established. SU level must be decreased below 300μmol\/l (50mg\/l) in all gout patients or at least below 360μmol\/l (60ml\/l) when the 300μmol\/l target cannot be reached, and must be maintained at these targets and monitored life-long. The choice of the ULT primarily relies on renal function: in patients whose estimated glomerular filtration rate (eGFR) is above 60ml\/min\/1.73m, first-line ULT is allopurinol; in those with eGFR between 30 and 60ml\/min\/1.73m, allopurinol use must be cautious and febuxostat can be considered as an alternative; and in those whose eGFR is below 30ml\/min\/1.73m, allopurinol must be avoided and febuxostat should be preferred. Prophylaxis of ULT-induced gout flares involves progressive increase of ULT dosage and low-dose colchicine for at least 6 months. Cardiovascular risk factors and diseases, the metabolic syndrome and chronic kidney disease must be screened and managed.\nCONCLUSION: These recommendations aim to provide simple and clear guidance for the management of ULT in France.",

Allopurinol and febuxostat are the most commonly used urate-lowering therapies with established safety and efficacy in CKD patients. The objective of the systematic review is to assess the long-term renal outcomes of allopurinol compared with febuxostat in patients with hyperuricemia and CKD or kidney transplantation. PubMed MEDLINE, Embase, Web of Science, Scopus, and Cochrane CENTRAL databases were searched from inception to December 2019 using the key terms \"allopurinol,\" \"febuxostat,\" \"xanthine oxidase inhibitors,\" \"gout suppressants,\" \"hyperuricemia,\" \"gout,\" \"chronic renal insufficiency,\" and \"kidney transplantation.\" Studies with follow-up duration ≥ 12 months were included. Risk of bias was assessed using the Cochrane Risk Of Bias In Non-randomized Studies-of Interventions (ROBINS-I) tool. Three retrospective observational studies with follow-up duration ranging from 1 to 5 years were reviewed. Febuxostat patients had a significantly higher estimated glomerular filtration rate, reduced risk for renal disease progression, and reduced serum uric acid levels compared with allopurinol patients. All studies had a serious risk of bias. Febuxostat may be more renoprotective than allopurinol in patients with both hyperuricemia and CKD based on evidence from small long-term retrospective studies with serious risk of bias. More methodologically rigorous studies are needed to determine the clinical applicability of these results.",

Plasma febuxostat and serum and urinary urate and creatinine concentrations were determined. Febuxostat pharmacokinetics were estimated using a two-compartment model with first-order absorption. An Emax PK-PD model was fitted to mean febuxostat and urate concentrations. Urinary urate excretion and FCU were calculated pre- and post-dose.\nRESULTS: Maximum mean plasma concentration of febuxostat (2.7 mg L ) was observed 1.2 hours after dosage. Febuxostat initial and terminal half-lives were 2.0 ± 1.0 and 14.0 ± 4.7 hours (mean ± SD), respectively. The majority (81%) of the drug was eliminated in the 9 hours after dosing. Serum urate declined slowly achieving mean nadir (0.20 mmol L ) at 24 hours. The IC (plasma febuxostat concentration that inhibits urate production by 50%) was 0.11 ± 0.09 mg L (mean ± SD). Urinary urate excretion changed in parallel with serum urate. There was no systematic or significant change in FCU from baseline.\nCONCLUSION: The PK-PD model could potentially be used to individualise febuxostat treatment and improve clinical outcomes. A single dose of febuxostat does not affect the efficiency of the kidney to excrete urate. Further investigations are required to confirm the present results following multiple dosing with febuxostat.",

        "Abstract":"Dry eye syndrome is a common disease associated to eyes inflammation, irritation and tear film instability. The enzymatic complex of xanthine oxidoreductase (XOR) is involved in the generation of reactive oxygen species (ROS) and uric acid that, in the end, can cause reperfusion injuries, irritation and pathological conditions. Furthermore, in the eye, it has been proposed that oxygen free radicals might play a significant role in retinal ischemic damage. A new artificial drop formulation based on arabinogalactan and hyaluronic acid has been proposed in this article. The uric acid and the ROS formation have been monitored. The effect of the arabinogalactan, the hyaluronic acid and their mixture has been studied. The arabinogalactan entails a uric acid and ROS reduction of 27% and 38% respectively; no significant reduction of uric acid or ROS has been observed after the addition of hyaluronic acid alone. Notably the combination of arabinogalactan and hyaluronic acid involves the reduction of uric acid and ROS equal to 38% and 62%, namely. This study demonstrates that this artificial drop formulation can markedly reduce the uric acid and ROS formation in vitro; thus, the use of this formulation may contribute in the resolution of the dry eye syndrome.",

In this retrospective cohort study, we compared the risk of incident HTN of gout patients between those undergoing and not undergoing ULT. Risks of new-onset diabetes mellitus (DM) and chronic kidney disease (CKD) were also examined. In total, 2712 gout patients from 2000 to 2012 were enrolled. Overall incidence rates of HTN, DM, and CKD were compared between 1356 patients undergoing ULT recipients and 1356 matched control patients. After adjustment for sex, age, area, comorbidities, and drugs used, the incidence rates of HTN were 4.8 and 3.0 per 100 person years for non-ULT and ULT patients, respectively. ULT patients had a lower adjusted hazard ratio (aHR) of HTN (aHR: 0.64, 95% confidence interval [CI]: 0.54-0.75, p  <  0.001) than non-ULT patients. The lower risk of incident HTN after xanthine oxidase inhibitors exhibited a significant dose-response trend. ULT patients also had a lower risk of DM (aHR: 0.55, 95% CI: 0.43-0.70) than non-ULT patients. ULT patients exhibited no significant difference in CKD development (aHR: 1.04, 95% CI: 0.85-1.27) as compared with non-ULT patients.

Crystal identification in synovial fluid by polarised light microscopy is considered the diagnostic gold standard. Imaging procedures such as high-resolution ultrasonography are also useful. Non-steroidal anti-inflammatory drugs, steroids and colchicine (not approved in Switzerland, available from pharmacies) are used to treat an acute gout attack. Just as important as the diagnosis and treatment of an acute attack is the long-term management of hyperuricaemia in order to prevent further gout attacks as well as possible renal, cardiac or metabolic complications. Therefore, patients with a confirmed diagnosis of gout should, apart from non-pharmacologic interventions, receive hypouricaemic therapy with a target uric acid level of <360 µmol\/l (<6 mg\/dl). Drugs of first choice are xanthine oxidase inhibitors. Achievement of the therapeutic objective should be periodically reviewed, adjusting therapy as necessary.",

A total of 569 emergency department patients were prospectively analyzed and assigned to intensive care (ICU group, n = 431) or other departments (n = 138). Uric acid (UA) levels were significantly higher in the intensive care patients (6.3 [5.1-7.6] mg\/dl vs. 5.8 [4.6-6.8] mg\/dL). The plasma xanthine oxidoreductase (XOR) activity in the ICU group (68.3 [21.2-359.5] pmol\/h\/mL) was also significantly higher than that in other departments (37.2 [15.1-93.6] pmol\/h\/mL). Intensive care patients were divided into three groups according to plasma XOR quartiles (Q1, low-XOR, Q2\/Q3, normal-XOR, and Q4, high-XOR group). A multivariate logistic regression model showed that lactate (per 1.0 mmol\/L increase, OR 1.326; 95%, CI 1.166-1.508, p < 0.001) and the Acute Physiology and Chronic Health Evaluation II score (per 1.0 point increase, OR 1.095, 95% CI 1.034-1.160, p = 0.002) were independently associated with the high-XOR group.

        "Abstract":"BACKGROUND: Gout is the most common form of inflammatory arthritis worldwide and its prevalence is rising. In Switzerland, there are no data available on the characteristics and treatment of gout patients. In this study, we aimed to describe numbers of patients affected by gout and hyperuricaemia and unveil approaches Swiss primary care physicians (PCPs) use for the management.\nMETHODS: This was a retrospective observational study using electronic medical routine &nbsp;data provided from 242 Swiss PCPs. Included were all their patients receiving urate-lowering therapy (ULT), with a diagnostic code for gout or who had a serum uric acid (SUA) measurement. According to their disease status, patients were classified into four subgroups (normal urate, hyperuricaemia, untreated gout, treated gout). For treatment analysis, patients with SUA measurements before and after ULT initiation were included. Comorbidities and risk factors for secondary causes relevant in the context of gout were collected. Outcomes were prevalence of gout and hyperuricaemia, characteristics of patients according to subgroup, number of SUA measurements, levels of SUA and patients who reached the treatment goal of a SUA level &lt;360 &micro;mol\/l.\nRESULTS: We assessed 15,808 patients and classified them into the subgroups. This yielded a prevalence of 1.0% for gout and 1.2% for hyperuricaemia. 2642 patients were diagnosed with gout of whom 2420 (91.6%) received a ULT. Overall; 41.3% of patients with a gout treatment had at least one SUA measurement; 15.0% of patients with treated gout had a record of SUA measurements before and after ULT initiation; and 57.5% reached the treatment goal of &lt;360 &micro;mol\/l after allopurinol treatment.\nCONCLUSION: Swiss gout patients received comprehensive treatment, which is reflected in a high number of patients treated with ULT, laboratory tests per person and a high treatment success rate, although there is no systematic approach to the treatment of gout.",

        "Abstract":"INTRODUCTION: Inflammation induced by urate deposition in joints causes gout. Healthy individuals maintain serum levels of urate by balancing urate production\/excretion, whereas a production\/excretion imbalance increases urate levels. Hyperuricemia is diagnosed when the serum urate level is continuously above 7 mg\/dl as the solubility limit, and urate accumulates in the kidneys and joints. Because hyperuricemia increases the risk of gout, therapies aim to eliminate urate deposition to prevent gouty arthritis and kidney injury.\nAREAS COVERED: This review discusses the mechanism underlying hyperuricemia with respect to urate production and urate transport, along with urate-lowering therapeutics, including urate synthesis inhibitors, uricolytic enzymes, and uricosuric agents. The authors asses published data on relevant commercial therapy development projects and clinical trials.\nEXPERT OPINION: Available treatment options for hyperuricemia are limited. Allopurinol, a urate synthesis inhibitor, is generally administered at a reduced dosage to patients with renal impairment. Some URAT1 inhibitors have an unfavorable side effect profile. A promising strategy for treatment is the use of uricosuric agents that inhibit transporters (e.g. URAT1, URATv1\/GLUT9, OAT10) which reabsorb urate from the urine.",

        "Published":"2020-04-22",
        "Abstract":"BACKGROUND: An elevated level of serum uric acid (SUA) is associated with an increased risk of cardiovascular disease. Pharmacological intervention with urate-lowering agents, such as the conventional purine analogue xanthine oxidase (XO) inhibitor, allopurinol, has been used widely for a long period of time in clinical practice to reduce SUA levels. Febuxostat, a novel non-purine selective inhibitor of XO, has higher potency for inhibition of XO activity and greater urate-lowering efficacy than conventional allopurinol. However, clinical evidence regarding the effects of febuxostat on atherosclerosis is lacking. The purpose of the study was to test whether treatment with febuxostat delays carotid intima-media thickness (IMT) progression in patients with asymptomatic hyperuricemia.\nMETHODS AND FINDINGS: The study was a multicenter, prospective, randomized, open-label, blinded-endpoint clinical trial undertaken at 48 sites throughout Japan between May 2014 and August 2018. Adults with both asymptomatic hyperuricemia (SUA >7.0 mg\/dL) and maximum IMT of the common carotid artery (CCA) ≥1.1 mm at screening were allocated equally using a central web system to receive either dose-titrated febuxostat (10-60 mg daily) or as a control-arm, non-pharmacological lifestyle modification for hyperuricemia, such as a healthy diet and exercise therapy. Of the 514 enrolled participants, 31 were excluded from the analysis, with the remaining 483 people (mean age 69.1 years [standard deviation 10.4 years], female 19.7%) included in the primary analysis (febuxostat group, 239; control group, 244), based on a modified intention-to-treat principal. The carotid IMT images were recorded by a single sonographer at each site and read in a treatment-blinded manner by a single analyzer at a central core laboratory. The primary endpoint was the percentage change from baseline to 24 months in mean IMT of the CCA, determined by analysis of covariance using the allocation adjustment factors (age, gender, history of type 2 diabetes, baseline SUA, and baseline maximum IMT of the CCA) as the covariates. Key secondary endpoints included changes in other carotid ultrasonographic parameters and SUA and the incidence of clinical events. The mean values (± standard deviation) of CCA-IMT were 0.825 mm ± 0.173 mm in the febuxostat group and 0.832 mm ± 0.175 mm in the control group (mean between-group difference [febuxostat - control], -0.007 mm [95% confidence interval (CI) -0.039 mm to 0.024 mm; P = 0.65]) at baseline; 0.832 mm ± 0.182 mm in the febuxostat group and 0.848 mm ± 0.176 mm in the control group (mean between-group difference, -0.016 mm [95% CI -0.051 mm to 0.019 mm; P = 0.37]) at 24 months. Compared with the control group, febuxostat had no significant effect on the primary endpoint (mean percentage change 1.2% [95% CI -0.6% to 3.0%] in the febuxostat group (n = 207) versus 1.4% [95% CI -0.5% to 3.3%] in the control group (n = 193); mean between-group difference, -0.2% [95% CI -2.3% to 1.9%; P = 0.83]). Febuxostat also had no effect on the other carotid ultrasonographic parameters. The mean baseline values of SUA were comparable between the two groups (febuxostat, 7.76 mg\/dL ± 0.98 mg\/dL versus control, 7.73 mg\/dL ± 1.04 mg\/dL; mean between-group difference, 0.03 mg\/dL [95% CI -0.15 mg\/dL to 0.21 mg\/dL; P = 0.75]). The mean value of SUA at 24 months was significantly lower in the febuxostat group than in the control group (febuxostat, 4.66 mg\/dL ± 1.27 mg\/dL versus control, 7.28 mg\/dL ± 1.27 mg\/dL; mean between-group difference, -2.62 mg\/dL [95% CI -2.86 mg\/dL to -2.38 mg\/dL; P < 0.001]). Episodes of gout arthritis occurred only in the control group (4 patients [1.6%]). There were three deaths in the febuxostat group and seven in the control group during follow-up. A limitation of the study was the study design, as it was not a placebo-controlled trial, had a relatively small sample size and a short intervention period, and only enrolled Japanese patients with asymptomatic hyperuricemia.\nCONCLUSIONS: In Japanese patients with asymptomatic hyperuricemia, 24 months of febuxostat treatment did not delay carotid atherosclerosis progression, compared with non-pharmacological care. These findings do not support the use of febuxostat for delaying carotid atherosclerosis in this population.\nTRIAL REGISTRATION: University Hospital Medical Information Network Clinical Trial Registry UMIN000012911.",

We tested whether allopurinol could improve skeletal muscle energetics and physical function in older people with impaired physical performance.\nMETHODS: We conducted a randomised, double blind, parallel group, placebo-controlled trial, comparing 20 weeks of allopurinol 600 mg once daily versus placebo. We recruited community-dwelling participants aged 65 and over with baseline 6-min walk distance of <400 m and no contraindications to magnetic resonance imaging scanning. Outcomes were measured at baseline and 20 weeks. The primary outcome was post-exercise phosphocreatine (PCr) recovery rate measured using 31P magnetic resonance spectroscopy of the calf. Secondary outcomes included 6-min walk distance, short physical performance battery (SPPB), lean body mass measured by bioimpedance, endothelial function and quality of life.\nRESULTS: In total, 124 participants were randomised, mean age 80 (SD 6) years. A total of 59 (48%) were female, baseline 6-min walk distance was 293 m (SD 80 m) and baseline SPPB was 8.5 (SD 2.0). Allopurinol did not significantly improve PCr recovery rate (treatment effect 0.10 units [95% CI, -0.07 to 0.27], P = 0.25). No significant changes were seen in endothelial function, quality of life, lean body mass or SPPB. Allopurinol improved 6-min walk distance (treatment effect 25 m [95% 4-46, P = 0.02]). This was more pronounced in those with high baseline oxidative stress and urate.\nCONCLUSION: Allopurinol improved 6-min walk distance but not PCr recovery rate in older people with impaired physical function.

These patients were divided into allopurinol 300mg\/d (control), febuxostat 40mg\/d (F40) and 80mg\/d (F80) groups respectively. All patients took potassium citrate as a combination treatment and had been followed up for at least 6 months. Before treatment and on after 1st, 3rd and 6th month, complete blood count, serum uric acid (sUA), hepatic and renal function as well as ultrasound were carried out. Arthritic and gastrointestinal symptoms were also monitored. Computed tomography was performed before treatment and 6 months after medication.\nRESULTS: Compared with allopurinol group, F40 group showed no difference in urate-lowering effect, while F80 had the best effect across all the visits (P<0.01). At 6th month, 25(83.3%) cases of F80 group achieved sUA<6mg\/ dL, which was better than allopurinol group (18 cases, 58.1%) and F40 group (17 cases, 58.6%). In the dissolution effect of radiolucent calculi, F80 had the best effect, followed by F40 and then allopurinol (P<0.05).

        "Abstract":"OBJECTIVES: Results from a recent study showed that the risk of cardiovascular and all-cause mortality was higher in patients who received febuxostat, a potent urate-lowering agent, than that in patients who received allopurinol. Therefore, we hypothesized that an abrupt change in serum urate levels caused by urate-lowering agents would influence the risk of cardiovascular events.\nMETHODS: We included patients with a history of cardiovascular disease (CVD) who received allopurinol or febuxostat. Cardiovascular events were defined as follows: nonfatal myocardial infarction, nonfatal stroke, unstable angina, heart failure, and cardiovascular death. The change in serum urate levels was determined by the difference or reduction rate in urate within 6 months after exposure to allopurinol or febuxostat. The factors associated with cardiovascular events were evaluated by Cox regression analysis.\nRESULTS: In total, 207 patients with CVD who were exposed to allopurinol or febuxostat were included. Cardiovascular events occurred in 38 patients (18.4%). In univariate analysis, age, diabetes mellitus, baseline urate levels, difference in mean urate levels between baseline and post-exposure (Δurate), and reduction rate in urate to the lowest post-exposure levels (Δurate\/day) were associated with cardiovascular events. Further, results from the multivariate analysis revealed that age [hazard ratio (HR) 1.036, 95% confidence interval (CI), 1.001-1.072, p = 0.042], Δurate (HR 1.188, CI, 1.033-1.366, p = 0.015), and Δurate\/day (HR 6.963, CI, 2.215-21.886, p = 0.001) were associated with cardiovascular events.\nCONCLUSION: Rapid reduction in serum urate levels was associated with a higher risk of cardiovascular events.

        "Abstract":"['Aims:', 'Materials and methods:', 'Results:', 'Conclusions:']\nAllopurinol is the most common urate lowering therapy (ULT) used to treat gout but may cause life-threatening severe cutaneous adverse reactions (SCAR) in a small number of patients. Risk of SCAR is increased for patients with the HLA-B*58:01 genotype. When alternative ULT is required, febuxostat or probenecid are recommended. The aim of this study was to conduct a cost-utility analysis of sequential ULT treatment strategies for gout, including strategies with and without HLA-B*58:01 genotyping prior to treatment initiation, with a view to inform optimal gout management in Singapore. A Markov model was developed from the Singapore healthcare payer perspective. Reflecting local practice, 12 different treatment strategies containing at least one ULT (allopurinol, febuxostat, probenecid) were evaluated in adults with gout. Response rates (SUA < 6mg\/dL) were derived from an in-house network meta-analysis and from published literature. Incremental cost-effectiveness ratios (ICERs) were calculated over a 30-year time horizon, with costs and benefits discounted at 3% per annum. Sensitivity analyses were conducted to explore uncertainties. Sequential treatment of allopurinol 300 mg\/day-allopurinol 600 mg\/day-probenecid (\"standard of care\") was cost-effective compared to no ULT, with an ICER of SGD1,584\/QALY. Allopurinol300-allopurinol600-probenecid-febuxostat sequence compared to allopurinol300-allopurinol600-probenecid had an ICER of SGD11,400\/QALY. All other treatment strategies were dominated by preceding strategies. Treatment strategies incorporating HLA-B*58:01 genotyping before ULT use were dominated by the corresponding non-genotyping strategy. Current standard of care (allopurinol300-allopurinol 600-probenecid) for gout is cost-effective compared with no ULT in the local context. Febuxostat is unlikely to be cost-effective in Singapore at current prices unless it is used last-line.",

A number of risk factors for these serious adverse reactions have been identified including ethnicity, HLA-B∗5801 genotype, kidney impairment, allopurinol starting dose, and concomitant diuretic use. There is a complex interplay between these risk factors, which may (albeit rarely) lead to allopurinol-related serious adverse events. Although oxypurinol, the active metabolite of allopurinol, has been implicated, there is no defined drug concentration at which the reaction will occur. There is no specific treatment other than the cessation of allopurinol and supportive care. Whether hemodialysis, which rapidly removes oxypurinol, improves outcomes remains to be determined. Strategies to help reduce this risk are therefore important, which includes screening for HLA-B∗5801 in high-risk individuals, commencing allopurinol at low dose, and educating patients about the signs and symptoms of severe cutaneous adverse reactions, and what to do if they occur.",

        "Abstract":"BACKGROUND: The 24-hour uric acid excretion measurement is important in assessing disease status and helping to select the appropriate uric acid-lowering agent for patients with gout, however, it is inconvenient. The authors investigated the efficacy of the random urine uric acid-to-creatinine (UA\/CR) ratio to screen the patients who under-secreted 24-hour urine uric acid.\nMETHODS: This was a retrospective cross-sectional study. Ninety patients with gout, without undergoing uric acid-lowering treatment were enrolled. Twenty-four-hour urine and random urine samples were obtained on the same day. Six hundred mg of uric acid in the 24-hour urine sample was used as a standard for distinguishing between over and under-excretion groups.\nRESULTS: The random urinary UA\/CR ratio showed positive correlation with 24-hour urine uric acid excretion (γ = 0.398,  < 0.001). All the patients with the random UA\/CR less than 0.2 excreted less than 600 mg uric acid in 24-hour urine collection. When the random urine UA\/CR ratio < 0.2 was regarded as a positive result, the positive predictive value, negative predictive value, sensitivity, and specificity in the uric acid under-excretion were 100% (8 of 8), 64.6% (53 of 82), 21.6% (8 of 37), and 100% (53 of 53), respectively.\nCONCLUSION: There is a moderate positive correlation between the random urinary UA\/CR ratio and 24-hour urine uric acid excretion, so that UA\/CR ratio may not be a good predictor of 24-hour urine uric acid excretion. However, the random urine UA\/CR ratio 0.2 can be a useful predictor to screen the gouty patients who need to be treated with uricosuric drugs.",

        "Abstract":"Gout is a common rheumatic condition caused due to increase in serum uric acid level (hyperuricemia). Uricase is for lowering the level of uric acid but unfortunately, it is not produced in humans due to evolutionary changes. Therefore, it is administered to humans from outside in case of the high uric acid level in blood. A different formulation of uricase from bacterial, fungal, and mammalian sources is present in the market for the treatment of hyperuricemia conditions. Uricase formulation showed immunogenic response due to the occurrence of hypersensitivity reaction during the treatment that results in poor patient compliance. The purpose of this study was to clarify the variation of Uricase immunogenicity from different sources. We have used some immunoinformatic approaches to analyze and understand some structural aspects of immunogenic and allergenic epitopes of Uricase by calculation of relative frequency for eleven global alleles. As per our knowledge, this is the first immunoinformatic study of Uricase (structural based immunogenicity prediction) that deciphered the high immunogenic nature of Uricase but no significant difference in immunogenicity was found among Uricase isolated from Aspergillus flavus, Bacillus subtillis, and mammalian source. This study gives a further lead to develop some methods (include bioengineering of less immunogenic version of the uricase or utilizing the homologous enzymes) for minimizing immune response or search new sources of uricase that could be less or non-immunogenic.",

        "Abstract":"The association between increased serum urate and hypertension has been a subject of intense controversy. Extracellular uric acid drives uric acid deposition in gout, kidney stones, and possibly vascular calcification. Mendelian randomization studies, however, indicate that serum urate is likely not the causal factor in hypertension although it does increase the risk for sudden cardiac death and diabetic vascular disease. Nevertheless, experimental evidence strongly suggests that an increase in intracellular urate is a key factor in the pathogenesis of primary hypertension. Pilot clinical trials show beneficial effect of lowering serum urate in hyperuricemic individuals who are young, hypertensive, and have preserved kidney function. Some evidence suggest that activation of the renin-angiotensin system (RAS) occurs in hyperuricemia and blocking the RAS may mimic the effects of xanthine oxidase inhibitors. A reduction in intracellular urate may be achieved by lowering serum urate concentration or by suppressing intracellular urate production with dietary measures that include reducing sugar, fructose, and salt intake. We suggest that these elements in the western diet may play a major role in the pathogenesis of primary hypertension. Studies are necessary to better define the interrelation between uric acid concentrations inside and outside the cell. In addition, large-scale clinical trials are needed to determine if extracellular and intracellular urate reduction can provide benefit hypertension and cardiometabolic disease.",

        "Abstract":"INTRODUCTION The Gout Stop Programme was developed for primary care in Northland, New Zealand, to address inequitable health outcomes for Māori and Pacific people with gout. AIM The aim of the programme was to make it easier for clinicians to prescribe urate-lowering treatment, facilitate patient adherence through education and support, and reduce barriers to gout prevention and long-term management. METHODS From 2015 to 2017, patients with acute gout who met inclusion criteria were prescribed treatment according to a 'Gout Stop Pack' option, based on renal function and diabetes status. Patients were monitored by community pharmacists. Gout educators and a Gout Kaiāwhina (community support worker) provided education and support to patients and whānau (families). Patient completion of the programme and outcomes, according to target serum urate level, were recorded. Patient experience was documented using a questionnaire and rating scale. RESULTS In total, 160 clinicians prescribed therapy at 887 patient presentations; 71% were Māori and Pacific patients. The completion rate was 55% in this group and 84% for the non-Māori and non-Pacific group. In the Māori and Pacific group, 40% reached the target serum urate level (≤0.36 mmol L-1) in 91 days, and 26% required further titration. In the non-Māori\/non-Pacific group, these rates were 51% and 19% respectively. Following programme completion, 68% of Māori and Pacific patients and 65% of non-Māori and non-Pacific patients continued to take allopurinol. The 21 patients interviewed rated the programme as excellent or very good. DISCUSSION Culturally appropriate education and support for patients and the primary care team was essential. Collaboration between prescribers, community pharmacists and support workers reduced barriers to initiating prevention and long-term urate-lowering treatment and urate testing in this high-needs gout population.",

        "Abstract":"BACKGROUND: Hyperuricemia might induce additional renal damage in children with hemolytic uremic syndrome related to Shiga toxin-producing Escherichia coli (STEC-HUS). A few case reports have shown rasburicase to be effective in decreasing serum uric acid (UA) and improving renal function. However, there is only one report on the use of rasburicase in a child with STEC-HUS, which shows satisfactory results. We describe here the safety and efficacy of rasburicase in nine additional cases.\nCASE-DIAGNOSIS\/TREATMENT: Data from 9 children (5 females, median age 2 years) who received rasburicase were reviewed. At admission, 6 were dehydrated and 3 euvolemic. Dehydrated patients received saline solution and afterwards, as well as for those initially euvolemic, we aimed to keep a neutral fluid balance. Despite this, urine output did not increase. Baseline creatinine was 3.35 mg\/dL (1.47-9.1) and UA 11.4 mg\/dL (8.3-19.2). A single dose of rasburicase (0.2 mg\/kg) was given 6-8 h after admission, which reduced UA levels to 1.8 mg\/dL (0.3-5, p = 0.009) on the next day. However, renal parameters worsen and dialysis had to be initiated. Then, while still on dialysis, a UA rebound occurred in all cases reaching a peak of 8.9 mg\/dL (4.5-13.8). Just after a steady increase in urine output, a sustained decline in UA levels concomitantly occurred with an improvement in renal function. At discharge, all patients reached normal UA levels. No side effects were recorded.\nCONCLUSIONS: Administration of rasburicase in children with STEC-HUS was safe but failed to provide any significant benefit despite fall in serum UA levels.",

Recent studies suggested the renoprotective effect of febuxostat among hyperuricaemia patients. The aim of this study was to evaluate the effects of febuxostat on kidney function in patients with hyperuricaemia.\nMETHODS: We conducted electronic searches in PubMed, Embase and Cochrane Central Register of Controlled Trials from January 1960 to July 2019 to identify RCT that examined the effects of febuxostat in adult patients with hyperuricaemia on serum creatinine, estimated glomerular filtration rate (eGFR), albuminuria, blood pressure parameters, major cardiovascular events, diarrhoea, joint pain, stroke and arrhythmia.\nRESULTS: Nine RCT with 2141 participants were included in this meta-analysis. Compared to placebo, the febuxostat group showed a higher eGFR at 6 months with a weighted mean difference (WMD) of 2.86 mL\/min\/1.73 m (P < 0.001), as well as the end of studies (eGFR WMD 2.69 mL\/min\/1.73 m , P < 0.001). There was also lower serum creatinine (SrCr WMD = -0.04 mg\/dL, P < 0.001), reduction in systolic blood pressure (SBP WMD = -1.18 mmHg, P < 0.001) and diastolic blood pressure (DBP WMD = -1.14 mmHg, P = 0.04). There was no statistical difference between febuxostat and placebo in major cardiovascular events, diarrhoea, joint symptoms, stroke events and arrhythmia. Subgroup analysis among chronic kidney disease showed the febuxostat group had higher eGFR than the placebo group (eGFR WMD = 2.69 mL\/min\/1.73 m , P < 0.001).\nCONCLUSION: Treating hyperuricaemia with febuxostat may slow the progression of chronic kidney disease irrespective of baseline renal function without significantly associated increased risks of major cardiovascular events, diarrhoea, joint symptoms, arrhythmia and stroke, compared to placebo.",

        "Abstract":"Unlike complete deficiency of hypoxanthine phosphoribosyltransferase (HPRT) (i.e., Lesch-Nyhan syndrome), partial HPRT deficiency causes HPRT-related hyperuricemia without neurological symptoms. Herein, we describe a 22-year-old man without neurological symptoms that presented gout, hyperuricemia (serum urate level, 12.2 mg\/dL), multiple renal microcalculi, and a family history of juvenile gout that was exhibited by his brother and grandfather. Genetic testing revealed a novel missense mutation, c.103G>A (p.V35M), in the HPRT1 gene, and biochemical testing (conducted using the patient's erythrocytes) showed that the patient retained only 12.4% HPRT enzymatic activity compared to that exhibited by a healthy control subject. We thus diagnosed the patient with HPRT-related hyperuricemia caused by partial HPRT deficiency. After his serum urate level was controlled via treatment with febuxostat, his gout did not recur. Thus, this study emphasizes that HPRT deficiency should be considered as a potential cause of familial juvenile gout, even in the absence of neurological symptoms.",

        "Abstract":"BACKGROUND: Hyperuricemia and gout have become public health concerns; many important guidelines have recommended xanthine oxidase inhibitors (XOIs) as the first-line urate-lowering therapies (ULTs) to treat chronic gout with hyperuricemia. However, whether treating hyperuricemia and gout with ULTs modifies cardiovascular risks remains controversial. The aim of this study was to assess the incident risk of cardiovascular (CV) events (CVE) in hyperuricemia population, assess the cardiovascular benefit-risk of ULTs in hyperuricemia patients with or without gout in diverse cardiovascular risk sub-groups, and specify the safety of different ULTs.\nMETHODS: We searched PubMed, Embase, the Cochrane Library, Wanfang, Chongqing VIP (CQVIP, en.cqvip.com), and China National Knowledge Infrastructure Database for prospective cohort studies and randomized controlled trials (RCTs) in English and Chinese. Potential medications included XOIs, and uricosurics. RCTs were divided into sub-groups analysis based on blinding status and patients' history of CV diseases. Risk ratios (RRs) were calculated and were reported with corresponding 95% confidence intervals (CIs) by fixed-effects or random-effects model.\nRESULTS: Seven prospective cohort studies and 17 RCT studies were included. The risks of both major adverse cardiovascular events (MACE) (RR = 1.72, 95% CI 1.28-2.33) and CVE (RR = 1.35, 95% CI 1.12-1.62) were higher in the hyperuricemia population than non-hyperuricemia one. In seven RCT studies where XOIs were compared with no-treatment or placebo, the results of five low CV risk studies showed that XOIs lowered the risks of both MACE (RR = 0.35, 95% CI 0.20-0.62) and CVE (RR = 0.61, 95% CI 0.44-0.85); whereas two high CV risk studies showed that XOIs lowered the risk of CVE (RR = 0.69, 95% CI 0.54-0.88) rather than MACE (RR = 0.62, 95% CI 0.29-1.35). In nine RCT studies where the cardiovascular safety between febuxostat and allopurinol were compared, no statistical difference was found in the risk of MACE or CVE.\nCONCLUSIONS: The hyperuricemia population does have a higher incidence of CVE, and the results suggested that XOIs might reduce the incidence of MACE and total CVE. In addition, from the perspective of cardiovascular safety, febuxostat equaled allopurinol in our meta-analysis.",

        "Abstract":"Hyperuricemia has been identified as an independent risk factor for coronary artery disease (CAD), with a dose-response association. In this study, we explored the causal association between gout and antigout medication and the risk of incidental CAD. We sampled data from the National Health Insurance Research Database and recruited 37,091 patients as the gout cohort, and 37,091 controls. Our primary endpoint was the diagnosis of CAD during follow-up. The overall study population was followed up until CAD diagnosis, withdrawal from the National Health Insurance program, or the end of the study. Cox proportional hazards regression models were used to examine the effect of gout on the risk of CAD, represented by the HR with the 95% CI. Patients with gout were at greater risk of CAD, compared with those without gout: HR=1.49 after adjusting for potential confounders. Non-steroidal anti-inflammatory drugs and prednisolone use was associated with a reduced risk of CAD: HR=0.63 and 0.50, respectively. Patients with gout, treated with antigout medication, exhibited a reduced risk of CAD compared with non-gout patients. Among patients with gout, those on antigout therapy had 32% lower risk compared with those not on antigout therapy: adjusted HR=0.68, 95% CI 0.63 to 0.73. Gout increases the risk of CAD, and the use of antigout medication reduces CAD risk. These results indicate that gout or hyperuricemia is a modifiable risk factor for CAD.",

        "Abstract":"Gout is increasing in prevalence despite effective pharmacotherapies. Barriers to effective management are largely educational deficiencies. Sufferers, usually men, need to understand more about gout, especially that maintaining serum urate below 0.36 mmol\/L will eliminate recurrent attacks. Also, of great importance is appreciating that sub-optimal adherence to urate-lowering therapy (ULT) will result in a return of attacks. Prescribers also need to understand that acute attacks are likely to occur in the first few months of urate-lowering therapy (ULT), but these can be mitigated by commencing with a dose of ULT reflective of renal function and escalating the dose slowly, every 2-5 weeks until target serum urate is achieved. Prophylaxis against acute attacks over the initial 6 months period of ULT can be enhanced further with concomitant colchicine or nonsteroidal anti-inflammatory drugs (NSAIDs).Gout is largely managed in primary care. Rates of adherence to ULT are 50% or less, worse than most other chronic illnesses. Efforts at educating primary care physicians to, firstly, manage gout effectively and, secondly, to educate their gout patients sufficiently have not been successful. Allied health practitioners, such as nurses, working with prescribers in primary care settings and given the mandate to educate and manage patients with gout, have been spectacularly effective. However, this approach is resource intensive. 'Personalised' eHealth interventions show promise as an alternative strategy, notably in improving adherence to ULT.Numerous applications for smart phones (apps) are now available to assist people with chronic health conditions. Their design needs to accommodate the barriers and enablers perceived by patients to maintaining adherence to prescribed therapies. Personalised feedback of serum urate may represent an important enabler of adherence to ULT in the case of gout.Harnessing mobile apps to support patients managing their chronic illnesses represents an important opportunity to enhance health outcomes. Rigorous, patient-centred and driven development is critical. These tools also require careful evaluation for effectiveness.",

        "Abstract":"Gout is the most common inflammatory arthritis and is often comorbid with cardiovascular disease (CVD). Hyperuricemia and gout are also independent risk factors for cardiovascular events, worsening heart failure (HF), and death. The recommended treatment modalities for gout have important implications for patients with CVD because of varying degrees of cardiovascular and HF benefit and risk. Therefore, it is critical to both manage hyperuricemia with urate-lowering therapy (ULT) and treat acute gout flares while minimizing the risk of adverse cardiovascular events. In this review, the evidence for the safety of pharmacologic treatment of acute and chronic gout in patients with CVD and\/or HF is reviewed. In patients with CVD or HF who present with an acute gout flare, colchicine is considered safe and potentially reduces the risk of myocardial infarction. If patients cannot tolerate colchicine, short durations of low-dose glucocorticoids are efficacious and may be safe. Nonsteroidal anti-inflammatory drugs should be avoided in patients with CVD or HF. The use of canakinumab and anakinra for acute gout flares is limited by the high cost, risk of serious infection, and relatively modest clinical benefit. For long-term ULT, allopurinol, and alternatively probenecid, should be considered first-line treatments in patients with CVD or HF given their safety and potential for reducing cardiovascular outcomes. An increased risk of cardiovascular death and HF hospitalization limit the use of febuxostat and pegloticase as ULT in this population. Ultimately, the selection of agents used for acute gout management and long-term ULT should be individualized according to patient and agent cardiovascular risk factors.",

This study aimed to investigate the effect of  Jacq. ex Wedd. (UW) on lowering uric acid and its mechanism by using HK2 cells and hyperuricemia mouse model. Petroleum ether extract (UWP), ethyl acetate extract (UWE), n-butanol extract (UWB), and alcohol-soluble extract (UWA) from UW were prepared, and HK2 cells were treated with various parts extracts to observe the expression of uric acid transporter at 25, 50, and 100 g\/mL for 24 h. Moreover, hyperuricemia mice were administered orally various parts extracts at 0.78 and 2.34 g\/kg (crude drug dose converted by extraction rate) to observe the change of hepatic XOD, serum ADA, renal function, and uric acid transporter.  experiments showed that UWA can remarkably elevate OAT1 expression and decrease URAT1 expression in HK2 cells.  experiments showed that UWP, UWE, UWB, and UWA showed remarkable activity in reducing uric acid, rendering a substantial decline in the SUA level in hyperuricemia mice. Compared with the hyperuricemia and allopurinol groups, UWB and UWA had significant protective effects on renal injury. At the same time, UWA can significantly reduce the activity of XOD and ADA, reduce the expression of URAT1, and increase the expression of OAT1. These results indicated that UWA had an outstanding uric acid lowering effect and did not affect renal function. This may be related to increased uric acid excretion and decreased uric acid production, mediated by renal OAT1, URAT1, liver XOD, and serum ADA. UWA may be a potential drug against hyperuricemia.",

The Japanese guideline for the management of hyperuricemia and gout recommends that drug selection should be based on classification of hyperuricemia as a fundamental principle. However, there may be some cases where this principle is not observed. We investigated the pharmacodynamics and safety of dotinurad in outpatients with uric acid overproduction or uric acid underexcretion type.\nMETHODS: This was a multicenter, open-label, forced titration study. Patients were classified as uric acid overproduction or underexcretion type. Study treatment was initiated at 0.5 mg\/day, followed by dose titration to the estimated maximum dose of 4 mg\/day over 14 weeks.

        "Abstract":"BACKGROUND: There are no sufficient data available on the use of febuxostat in patients undergoing dialysis.\nAIM: To investigate the efficacy and tolerability of febuxostat in gout patients on dialysis.\nMETHODS: We retrospectively reviewed clinical and laboratory data available from a referral centre from January 2012 to December 2018. We included gout patients who initiated febuxostat during dialysis. Data regarding serum uric acid levels before and after the febuxostat treatment and clinical information such as gout attack after febuxostat initiation, as well as adverse events involving febuxostat treatment, were obtained from medical records.\nRESULTS: Among 62 patients who were treated with febuxostat for over 3 months, 45 were undergoing haemodialysis (HD) and 17 were undergoing peritoneal dialysis (PD). The mean serum uric acid level was significantly reduced 3 months after treatment (3.71 ± 1.32 mg\/dL) compared with that at the pretreatment level (9.36 ± 2.06 mg\/dL) (P < 0.001). The serum uric acid level was observed to be significantly reduced at 3 months in both HD and PD patients and subsequently remained at a significantly reduced level for 12 months. Of the 62 patients, only two stopped febuxostat due to its adverse effects. Initial dose of 80 mg\/day was associated with higher adverse events compared to dose of 20-40 mg\/day (odds ratio 8.25, 95% confidence interval 1.90-35.97, P = 0.006).\nCONCLUSIONS: Febuxostat is efficacious and well tolerated in gout patients on dialysis. Febuxostat taken at dose of 20-40 mg\/day might be appropriate initial dose in patients undergoing dialysis.",

        "Abstract":"BACKGROUND: The objective of this meta-analysis of observational studies was to evaluate the efficacy and safety profiles of febuxostat in treating hyperuricemia among kidney transplant patients.\nMETHODS: We conducted electronic searches in PubMed, Embase, and Cochrane Central Register of Controlled Trials from January 1960 to July 2019 to identify studies that investigated the effects of febuxostat in kidney transplant patients on uric acid as well as safety profiles including estimated glomerular filtration rate (eGFR), hemoglobin level (Hb), white blood cell counts (WBC), liver enzymes, and trough level of tacrolimus.\nRESULTS: Seven observational studies with 367 participants were included in this meta-analysis. Compared with allopurinol, the febuxostat group demonstrated a higher odds of achieving target uric acid levels lower than 6 mg\/dL within 12 months (OR = 2.9, P = .004). However, there was no statistical difference in change of uric acid (WMD = -1.0 mg\/dL\/y, P = .32) and change in allograft eGFR within a year (WMD = 0.01 mL\/min\/1.73 m \/y, P = .98) between febuxostat and allopurinol. Regarding safety profiles, there were no statistical differences in eGFR, Hb, WBC, liver enzymes (AST, ALT), and trough level of tacrolimus between baseline and at the study end. Only one study reported suspected graft loss among febuxostat group.\nCONCLUSION: Among kidney transplant patients, treating hyperuricemia with febuxostat showed a higher odds of reaching the target of serum uric acid < 6 mg\/dL compared with allopurinol without causing significant side effects including change in tacrolimus level, liver function, decline in renal graft function, and bone marrow function.",

        "Abstract":"BACKGROUND: Pharmacological treatment and follow-up of gout is often inadequate.The patients risk repeated, painful arthritis flares and some develop chronic tophaceous gout and joint damage.\nMATERIAL AND METHOD: Since 1 March 2017, a structured care pathway has been established for patients with gout at the Department of Rheumatology, Haukeland University Hospital. Patients were placed on preventive medication, the majority on allopurinol, and were regularly monitored. Patient education is key to the care pathway. The treatment goal is to lower the concentration of serum urate to a level below a defined threshold value (360 µmol\/l for non-tophaceous gout or 300 µmol\/l for tophaceous gout). Patient data were collected on a continuous basis and recorded in a research database. The care pathway is assessed after 18 months.\nRESULTS: A total of 103 patients have been included, of whom 93 (90 %) are men, with an average age of 63 years and large variations in duration of the disease (min.-max. 0-36 years). Eight patients left the care pathway during the project. The average level of serum urate at inclusion was 446 µmol\/l (min.-max. 144-751 µmol\/l). The average maximum dose of allopurinol was 333 mg (min.-max. 100-700 mg). Survival analysis showed that three months after the start of urate-lowering therapy, 49 % of the patients had achieved their analytical treatment goal. Altogether 83 % achieved the goal within six months. The majority (70 %) were free of flares after achieving the treatment goal.\nINTERPRETATION: A standardised care pathway for gout enables adaptation of preventive treatment through regular monitoring. The care pathway helps the vast majority of patients to achieve treatment goals, which is crucial to avoid arthritis flares.",

For haematological malignancies, targeted therapies, such as small molecule inhibitors and monoclonal antibodies, have a high anti-tumour activity, are well tolerated, and have a low incidence of associated tumour lysis syndrome. The BCL-2 inhibitor venetoclax has a high anti-tumour activity in chronic lymphocytic leukaemia, achieving deep remissions by potently inducing apoptosis and increasing the risk for tumour lysis syndrome. In this Viewpoint, we discuss the pathophysiology, risk factors, monitoring, changes in laboratory parameters, and clinical manifestations of tumour lysis syndrome, and the prophylaxis and treatments available for this complication. Prophylaxis and treatment strategies have been implemented as standard of care in patients receiving venetoclax to minimise the risk of both laboratory and clinical manifestations of tumour lysis syndrome.",

We aimed to investigate whether lowering UA would have an effect on mortality and cardiovascular (CV) events in patients with HF in a systematic review and meta-analysis. The primary outcome measures were all-cause mortality, CV mortality, CV events, and CV hospitalization in patients with HF. We included 11 studies in our final analysis. Overall, allopurinol treatment was associated with a significant increase in the risk for all-cause mortality (hazard ratio [HR]: 1.24, 95% confidence interval [CI]: 1.04-1.49, P = .02). The trial heterogeneity is high (heterogeneity χ = 37.3, I2 = 73%, P < .001). With regard to CV mortality, allopurinol treatment was associated with a 42% increased risk of CV mortality (HR: 1.42, 95% CI: 1.11-1.81, P = .005). There was a trend toward increased CV hospitalization in the same group (HR: 1.21, 95% CI: 0.95-1.53, P = .12).

Late diagnosis of LND may cause significant morbidity. LND cases have never been reported in Indonesia. A 15-year-old male who had been diagnosed with cerebral palsy was referred to our hospital due to renal failure requiring emergency dialysis. The patient presented with three classic manifestations of LND: increased uric acid levels, neurological disorders, and self-injurious behaviors. LND was suspected because of an abscess-like lump on the left ankle that was confirmed to be a tophus, which had burst and discharged thick masses containing blood, debris, and white crystal materials. The diagnosis of LND was confirmed by the presence of a deletion to exon 1 of the HPRT1 gene. The patient received oral allopurinol daily and treatment for end-stage renal disease (ESRD), which included regular dialysis and subcutaneous administration of erythropoietin. At a 2-month follow-up, he improved clinically with a 71% decrease in uric acid levels after regular dialysis and allopurinol treatment. In developed countries, LND can be diagnosed as early as 3 days after birth. However, diagnosis in the present case was delayed due to the rarity of the disease and the limited number of facilities in Indonesia that offer genetic counseling. Late diagnosis of LND leads to ESRD and irreversible abnormalities. This is the first case of LND presenting with a unique clinical presentation of tophus burst reported in Indonesia.",

This multicenter observational retrospective study included patients diagnosed with gout and CKD stage 3 taking xanthine oxidase inhibitors (XOIs) (allopurinol or febuxostat) for at least 12 months. All patients were treated using a T2T strategy according to national gout guidelines to achieve the target levels of serum uric acid (sUA; < 5-6 mg\/dl) within 6 months of the first visit. The primary outcome was to assess changes in eGFR. The effects of independent variables were analyzed over eGFR in a linear mixed-effects (LME) model. Fifty patients with gout and CKD stage 3 treated with XOIs with a T2T strategy for 12 months were included. Eighty-two percent of the patients achieved the sUA target during the study period. The improvement seen in eGFR was higher during the first 6 months, showing a median increase of 7.54 ml\/min\/m (SE = 1.25) and trending towards stability over 12 months. For every 1 mg\/dl of decrease in sUA, an improvement of 1.5 ml\/min\/m in eGFR was observed (coefficient ± SE: - 1.58 ± 0.26) (p < 0.001) with no differences between type and dosage of XOIs treatment, colchicine administration, age, sex, and smoking status. A reduction in sUA levels using a T2T approach with XOIs at an optimal dose is possible and could help conserve and improve renal function in gouty patients with CKD stage 3.",

We used the search terms \"gout\", \"hyperuricaemia\" and \"guideline\". After two rounds of screening, we included the eligible CPGs of gout according to the pre-defined inclusion and exclusion criteria. Methodological quality of included guidelines was assessed with the AGREE-II instrument. The general characteristics of included guidelines and the recommendations were extracted, and the consistency of recommendations across guidelines was compared and analysed.\nRESULTS: A total of 15 gout guidelines including 359 recommendations were retrieved. The main topics covered by the recommendations were diagnosis, pharmacologic treatment of gout flares, pharmacologic urate-lowering therapy (ULT) of chronic gouty arthritis, lifestyle interventions, prophylaxis, and management of asymptomatic hyperuricaemia. The results of AGREE-II appraisal showed that only two guidelines achieved high scores (≥50%) in all six domains.

Sustained adherence to urate-lowering therapies (ULTs) is crucial for efficacy and therapeutic cost-effectiveness. Recently, several new ULTs have been proposed. We performed a systematic review and meta-analysis of randomized controlled trials (RCTs) to reassess the efficacy and safety of the current ULTs, focusing on adherence attrition-related adverse event reporting.\nMETHOD: The Bayesian network meta-analysis was applied to compare ULTs. Drug efficacy and safety were measured by whether the target level of serum urate acid was achieved and whether any adverse events occurred. The results were summarized using the pooled estimates of effect sizes (odds ratios), their precisions (95% credible interval), and the ranking probabilities.\nRESULTS AND CONCLUSIONS: Thirty-nine RCTs were identified, accumulating 19,401 patients. Consistent with previous studies, febuxostat (≥ 40 mg\/day) was superior to other monoagent ULTs. The new findings were as follows: (i) dual-agent ULTs were superior to febuxostat alone, and further surveillance on the adverse effects when lesinurad is uptitrated is needed, and (ii) terminalia bellerica 500 mg\/day, a novel xanthine oxidase inhibitor (XOI) made of natural fruit extracts, and topiroxostat ≥ 80 mg\/day, an XOI used mostly in Japan, could be new effective options for lowering the occurrence of adherence attrition events.

Hyperuricemia negatively impacts renal function in the non-sickle cell population but is understudied in SCD.\nMETHODS: We performed a cross-sectional analysis of the first 78 pediatric SCD patients enrolled in a cohort study. The mechanism of development of hyperuricemia (defined, serum uric acid (UA) ≥ 5.5 mg\/dL) was characterized as a result of either UA overproduction or inefficient renal excretion by the Simkin index and fractional clearance of urate (FCU) equations. Associations between hyperuricemia and albuminuria or estimated glomerular filtration rate (eGFR) were determined by linear regression.\nRESULTS: The prevalence of hyperuricemia in this young population (mean age 11.6 ± 3.77 years) was 34.2%. Only 1 hyperuricemic participant overproduced UA by Simkin index, while 62.5% were inefficient renal excretors of UA (FCU < 4%). Hyperuricemia was associated with a significant decrease in average eGFR, -27 ml\/min\/1.73m below normouricemia (mean eGFR 151.6 ± 40.32), p = 0.0122. Notably, the previously accepted association between decline of eGFR with age is significantly modified by hyperuricemia stratification, where hyperuricemia explains 44% of the variance in eGFR by age (R = 0.44, p = 0.0004) and is nonsignificant in normouricemia (R = 0.07, p = 0.0775).\nCONCLUSION: These findings indicate that hyperuricemia may be associated with early eGFR decline in SCN. This association must be further characterized in prospective cohort studies in SCN, and hyperuricemia must be investigated as a potential therapeutic target for SCN.",

        "Published":"2019-12-27",
        "Abstract":"OBJECTIVE: There is increasing evidence to show that hyperuricemia may have a pathogenic role in the progression of renal diseases. We performed a prospective, randomized, controlled trial to investigate the renal effects of allopurinol treatment in hyperuricemic patients with end-stage renal disease (ESRD) who undergo peritoneal dialysis.\nMETHODS: This was a unicenter, randomized, controlled clinical trial conducted in \"Alzahra Hospital, Isfahan, Iran.\" Patients were randomly assigned into treatment or control group. Treatment-group patients were administered a starting allopurinol dose of 100 mg\/day. The dose was adjusted according to serum uric acid level, aiming to maintain uric acid levels within the normal range. Participants were followed up for 6 months after receiving the medicine. Residual renal function (RRF) was assessed by measuring the renal component of Kt\/V urea and estimating the patient's glomerular filtration rate (GFR) by calculating the mean of urea and creatinine clearance. In addition, systolic and diastolic blood pressure and serum level of creatinine were measured every 3 months during the follow-up period.\nFINDINGS: Eighty patients were enrolled in the study and divided into two groups, including 40 ESRD patients receiving allopurinol and 40 ESRD did not receive allopurinol and considered as the control group. GFR measurements showed that there was not a significant difference between patients' RRF of two groups. However, allopurinol group had higher RRF than the control group during the follow-up period. Evaluating RRF by Kt\/V showed the same results.\nCONCLUSION: Our study demonstrated significant effects of allopurinol on decreasing serum levels of uric acid in ESRD patients undergoing peritoneal dialysis. On the other hand, renal residual function of patients under treatment with allopurinol was better than the control group. We recommend that further studies should be conducted on the effects of allopurinol with greater sample size and longer time of follow-up.",

        "Abstract":"['4mm', '4mm']\nPrevious studies reported that elevated serum uric acid level was associated with greater coronary lipid plaque. Xanthine oxidoreductase (XOR) is a rate-limiting enzyme in purine metabolism and is believed to play important roles in coronary atherosclerosis. However, the relation between XOR and coronary lipid plaque is unclear. Patients with stable coronary artery disease who underwent elective percutaneous coronary intervention under near-infrared spectroscopy intravascular ultrasound (NIRS-IVUS) guidance were prospectively included. They were divided into 3 groups according to plasma XOR activities based on a previous report: low, normal, and high. Quantitative coronary angiography and gray-scale IVUS were analyzed. The primary end point was coronary lipid plaques in a nontarget vessel assessed by NIRS-IVUS with lipid core burden index (LCBI) and maximum LCBI in 4 mm (maxLCBI). Out of 68 patients, 26, 31, and 11 patients were classified as low, normal, and high XOR activity groups. Quantitative coronary angiography demonstrated that the high XOR activity group had longer lesion length, smaller minimum lumen diameter, and higher percentage of diameter stenosis in a nontarget vessel among the 3 groups. Gray-scale IVUS analysis also showed smaller lumen area in the high XOR activity group than the others. LCBI (102.1 ± 56.5 vs 65.6 ± 48.5 vs 55.6 ± 37.8, p = 0.04) and maxLCBI (474.4 ± 171.6 vs 347.4 ± 181.6, 294.0 ± 155.9, p = 0.04) in a nontarget vessel were significantly higher in the high XOR group than in the normal and low groups. In conclusion, elevated XOR activity was associated with coronary lipid-rich plaque in a nontarget vessel in patients with stable coronary artery disease.",

        "Abstract":"While there is consensus on starting urate-lowering therapy (ULT) in cases of symptomatic hyperuricemia, the frequent condition of asymptomatic hyperuricemia (AH) remains a challenge due to differences in the findings of studies that have addressed the issue. Uric acid has anti-oxidant properties, but high levels predispose to gout and may play a role in metabolic syndrome. We systematically evaluated randomized controlled trials (RCTs) addressing ULT in patients with AH, to assess the current evidence. We found broad heterogeneity among the studies (13 RCTs), in terms of study design and population, making findings challenging to interpret and generalize; hard end-points were not assessed. Allopurinol is often prescribed for AH despite the fact that its use is not backed by conclusive evidence from prospective RCTs, nor is it recommended by the guidelines. Its potential benefits, in terms of absolute risk reduction, must be weighed against its potential for harm since it can trigger severe adverse hypersensitivity reactions, sometimes even fatal. RCTs with hard end-points are needed to assess the risk\/benefit of lowering uric acid in subjects with AH, particularly as secondary prevention for cardiovascular risk and in patients with different degrees of renal disease. To date, particularly after the result from the CARES trial, preventive treatment of asymptomatic and non-severe hyperuricemia is not recommended.",

        "Abstract":"While rasburicase has shown efficacy to rapidly correct hyperuricemia compared with allopurinol, its overall impact in improving clinically significant outcomes, such as acute kidney injury (AKI), in tumor lysis syndrome (TLS) is unknown. In this retrospective cohort study, we included all hospitalized cancer patients with hyperuricemia and AKI who received rasburicase +\/- allopurinol or allopurinol alone from 2009 to 2015. Inverse probability of treatment weighting using propensity score was used to account for potential confounders and to estimate the causal effect associated with differential drug treatment. 150 patients met inclusion criteria; 89 received rasburicase +\/- allopurinol and 61 received allopurinol alone. Weighted outcome regression analysis demonstrated that rasburicase was associated with significantly lower mean uric acid nadir at 7 days compared to allopurinol (2.70 versus 5.82 mg\/dL, p < 0.01). However, likelihood of renal function recovery (OR = 0.90, p = 0.79), creatinine nadir by 7 days (1.80 versus 1.66 mg\/dL, p = 0.51), and final creatinine by 30 days (2.08 versus 2.07 mg\/dL, p = 0.98) did not significantly differ. In conclusion, the clinical benefit of rasburicase in promoting renal function recovery in cancer patietns with concurrent hyperuricemia and renal failure remains inconclusive. Our results suggest that correction of hyperuricemia as a surrogate endpoint may not be associated with significant renal function improvement, particularly if renal dysfunction is unrelated to TLS.",

Fluoroquinolone-associated joint pain and tendon injury have been reported in long-term corticosteroid and transplant recipients, but data are lacking in patients with tuberculosis.\nOBJECTIVES: The objective of this study was to examine the incidence of joint pain manifested during administration of antituberculous therapy and their association with fluoroquinolones.\nMETHODS: Patients diagnosed with tuberculosis attending the outpatient clinic over a period of 1 year were reviewed and divided into 3 groups: group A receiving pyrazinamide, group B receiving a fluoroquinolone, and group C receiving both pyrazinamide and a fluoroquinolone. Latency to onset of joint pain was noted in all 3 groups. Joint pain was initially managed with analgesics, and associated hyperuricemia was treated with allopurinol\/febuxostat. Causative drugs were stopped in case of intolerable joint pain.\nRESULTS: 260 patients (47% females, aged 38 ± 18 years; mean ± SD) were included [group A (n = 140), group B (n = 81), and group C (n = 39)]. Overall, 76\/260 (29%) patients developed joint pain: group A - 24\/140 patients (17%), group B - 32\/81 patients (40%), and group C - 20\/39 patients (51%). The median latency to the onset of joint pain was 83 days (interquartile range, IQR 40-167): 55 days (IQR 32-66) in group A, 138 days (IQR 74-278) in group B, and 88 days (IQR 34-183) in group C.

        "Abstract":"50\nXanthine oxidase (XO) is a critical target for the therapy of hyperuricemia and gout. In this study, a number of 3-[4-alkoxy-3-(1H-tetrazol-1-yl) phenyl]-1,2,4-oxadiazol-5(4H)-ones (3a-3w) were newly designed by a bioisosteric replacement and hybrid strategy with the hope of obtaining novel and effective nonpurine XO inhibitors. Subsequently, these compounds were synthesized through a three-step procedure, with good yields. In addition, the in vitro bovine XO inhibitions were measured by spectrophotometric determination of uric acid formation at 295 nm using allopurinol as a positive control. As a result, compound 3j was found to be the most potent XO inhibitor, with an IC value of 0.121 µM, which was approximately 63-fold more potent than allopurinol, and the analysis of the structure-activity relationships indicated that the hydrophobic group at 4'-position was essential for inhibitory potency. Additionally, the molecular modeling results showed that the 1,2,4-oxadiazol-5(4H)-one moiety binds to XO active site via various hydrogen bonds with Arg880 and Thr1010. Moreover, the compound 3j was demonstrated to be a mixed-type nonpurine XO inhibitor. Furthermore, the hypouricemic studies on a rat model, induced by potassium oxonate, demonstrated that serum uric acid levels could be effectually reduced by compound 3j at an oral dose of 15 mg\/kg. Therefore, compound 3j could be a promising lead compound for the treatment of hyperuricemia and gout.",

        "Abstract":"Recently, extensive efforts have been made to understand the importance of the extra-renal uric acid (UA) excretion pathways and their contribution to UA-related diseases. However, the method typically used to measure UA concentrations in the intestinal lumen is difficult to real time and dynamic analysis. In this study, UA excretion in the rat intestinal lumen was measured in real time using an electrochemical method. A sensitive electrode to detect UA was constructed using a gold electrode modified with a mixed self-assembled monolayer. Excretion rate of UA in the intestine was calculated using time course data. A decrease in UA excretion rate was observed in the intestine after administration of serum UA-lowering drugs (benzbromarone, febuxostat, and topiroxostat). Inhibition of ATP-binding cassette transporter G2 (ABCG2) which has been reported as an important exporter of UA was suggested by administration of these drugs. On the other hand, an increase in excretion rate of UA was observed in the intestine of 5\/6 nephrectomy rats. Upregulation of mRNA expression of the UA transporter organic anion transporter OAT3, which is related to the secretion at the basal membrane, suggested an enhancement of UA excretion by ABCG2, a high-capacity UA exporter. Observed urate excretion dynamics and mRNA expression of UA transporters in the intestine upon administration of serum UA-lowering drugs and 5\/6 nephrectomy improve our understanding of the underlying mechanisms of intestinal UA excretion.",

The aims of this study were to determine the magnitude of the effect of tart cherry concentrate on SU in people with gout, the most effective dose of tart cherry concentrate for lowering SU, and adverse effects.\nMETHODS: Fifty people with gout and SU > 0.36 mmol\/l were recruited. Half were on allopurinol and half were on no urate-lowering therapy. Participants were randomized to receive tart cherry juice concentrate: placebo, 7.5 ml, 15 ml, 22.5 ml or 30 ml twice daily for 28 days. Blood samples were taken at baseline, then at 1, 3 and 5 h post cherry and then on days 1, 3, 7, 14, 21 and 28. The area under the curve for SU was calculated over the 28-day study period.\nRESULTS: Cherry concentrate dose had no significant effect on reduction in SU area under the curve, urine urate excretion, change in urinary anthocyanin between day 0 and day 28, or frequency of gout flares over the 28-day study period (P = 0.76). There were 24 reported adverse events, with only one (hyperglycaemia) considered possibly to be related to cherry concentrate. Allopurinol use did not modify the effect of cherry on SU or urine urate excretion.\nCONCLUSION: Tart cherry concentrate had no effect on SU or urine urate excretion. If there is an effect of cherry concentrate on gout flares over a longer time period, it is not likely to be mediated by reduction in SU.\nTRIAL REGISTRATION: Australian New Zealand Clinical Trials Registry (ANZCTR), https:\/\/www.anzctr.org.au\/Trial\/Registration\/TrialReview.aspx?id=368887, ANZCTR 12615000741583).",

        "Abstract":"Hyperuricemia (HUA) is positively correlated with the progression of cardiovascular and metabolic diseases. Anti-HUA drugs aim to either reduce uric acid production or promote uric acid excretion. Urate transporter 1 (URAT1) is a major urate transporter involved in renal uric acid reabsorption and excretion, making it an important anti-HUA drug target. To better understand the characteristics of URAT1 under pathological conditions, the present study aims to investigate URAT1 modulation in HUA mouse and cell line models. We found that URAT1 expression increased in the kidneys of HUA mice with normal renal function, but decreased in HUA mice with kidney injury (KI-HUA). In KI-HUA mice, treatment with anti-HUA agents, febuxostat, and benzbromarone decreased uric acid levels. However, febuxostat treatment also decreased URAT1 expression, whereas benzbromarone treatment increased its expression. Based on these in vivo findings, we propose that extracellular uric acid levels in the proximal tubule epithelial cells positively regulated URAT1 expression. In high uric acid cell models, URAT1 expression increased within 2 h of uric acid stimulation in a dose-dependent manner that supported our hypothesis. Therefore, our results suggest that URAT1 expression is positively regulated by the distinct extracellular uric acid levels in different HUA models.",

After propensity score matching, compared with non-users (n = 3607), XOI users (n = 3607) showed similar incidence of MACE (hazard ratio [HR]: 0.997, 95% CI, 0.879, 1.131; P>0.05) and all-cause mortality (HR = 0.972, 95% CI 0.886, 1.065, P=0.539). Febuxostat (n = 276) users showed a similar risk of MACE compared with allopurinol users (n = 828; HR: 0.672, 95% CI, 0.416, 1.085; P=0.104) with a tendency towards a lower risk of heart failure-related hospitalizations (HR = 0.529, 95% CI 0.272, 1.029; P=0.061). Concurrent colchicine use reduced the risk for all-cause mortality amongst XOI users (HR = 0.671, 95% 0.586, 0.768; P<0.001).\nCONCLUSION: In gout patients, XOI users showed similar risk of MACE and all-cause mortality compared with non-users. Compared with allopurinol users, febuxostat users showed similar MACE and all-cause mortality risks but lower heart failure-related hospitalizations.",

Descriptive statistics, health assessment questionnaire, global visual analog scale for general health and Gout Knowledge Questionnaire were calculated comparing patients at sUA goal or not at sUA goal. Univariate analysis and logistic regression models were applied to analyze data. The proportion of urate-lowering therapy (ULT) use was 61.2% (211\/350). The mean ± standard deviation sUA of the participants was 475.07 ± 121.53 μmol\/L. Only 17.4% of gout patients attain the serum urate goal, which also means 289(82.6%) patients cannot keep their sUA below the target of 360 μmol\/L. The factors associated with sUA goal attainment including age, education level and ULT use. Among these, age, waist hip ratio, ULT, family history of cardiovascular disease was the predictor of sUA goal attainment. In conclusion, more than 80% of gout patients did not achieve sUA goal. Younger and fatter patients were more difficult to control the serum urate level.",

        "Abstract":"1\nThe present study was conducted to evaluate the antihyperuricemic effect of sinapic acid (SA). The results showed that SA potently inhibited xanthine oxidase (XOD) in a dose-dependent manner by entering the enzyme active site and thwarting the entrance of the substrate. These results were further confirmed by the quantum chemical descriptors analysis and  H NMR titration analysis. The in vivo results indicated that SA not only has the potential to inhibit serum and hepatic XOD (p < .05), but also remarkably lowered serum and urine uric acid levels at 50 and 100 mg\/kg bw. Furthermore, SA regulated serum creatinine and blood urea nitrogen levels to normal and lowered inflammation in the renal tubules. Thus, the utilization of SA as an antihyperuricemic agent may have considerable potential for the development of functional foods for the possible treatment of hyperuricemia. PRACTICAL APPLICATIONS: Plant-derived bioactive compounds have multiple health benefits. The present study assesses the effects of sinapic acid against hyperuricemia. The results suggested that sinapic acid may have a strong protective effect against uric acid-related complications and may be used for the formulation of functional foods. However, further mechanistic studies are required to verify this hypothesis.",

Such interventions should preferentially be delivered face-to-face rather than remotely. The recently published CARES study raises the possibility that febuxostat increases the risk of death in people with preexisting major cardiovascular diseases, and, allopurinol should remain the first-choice ULT. There is paucity of data on the dosing of ULT for managing hyperuricaemia in gout patients with chronic kidney disease. However, recent research suggests that the dose of allopurinol can be gradually increased to above the conventional renal dose in people with chronic kidney disease without allopurinol hypersensitivity syndrome. However, additional larger studies are needed in this field.\nSUMMARY: In summary, long-term treat-to-target ULT prevents gout flares and improves quality of life. Given the recent safety concerns, gradually up-titrated allopurinol remains the first-line urate-lowering drug.",

        "Abstract":"The management of gout consists of urate-lowering therapy and acute and chronic anti-inflammatory drugs. Allopurinol, a xanthine oxidase inhibitor, is the primary urate-lowering therapy employed for decades. Recent studies suggest cardiovascular disease and mortality, chronic kidney disease, prostate cancer, and manic symptoms are reduced in patients with gout treated with allopurinol. These findings support that allopurinol contributes to a variety of beneficial effects beyond urate lowering. This manuscript reviews the analgesic and anti-inflammatory properties of allopurinol, which are rarely discussed. Several mechanisms are suggested to confer these benefits including accumulation of adenosine and inhibitory effects of allopurinol on reactive oxygen species, tumor necrosis factor- α, nuclear factor kappa-light-chain-enhancer of activated B cells, and the NACHT, LRR and PYD domains-containing protein 3 (NLRP3) inflammasome. Also, allopurinol blocks the stimulating effects of thioredoxin-interacting protein and interacts directly with the redox-active domain of thioredoxin as a negative regulator, decreasing NLRP3 activation. The importance of allopurinol's analgesic and anti-inflammatory properties requires further study and the implications to patient care better understood.",

        "Abstract":"BACKGROUND: Dotinurad, a novel selective urate reabsorption inhibitor, exerts a serum uric acid-lowering effect by selectively inhibiting urate transporter 1 (URAT1) in patients with hyperuricemia. It is generally known that the progression of renal dysfunction is associated with a reduction in the serum uric acid-lowering effects of uricosuric drugs. We, therefore, investigated the pharmacokinetics (PK), pharmacodynamics (PD), and safety of dotinurad in subjects with renal dysfunction.\nMETHODS: This was a parallel-group, open-label, single-dose clinical pharmacology study. Dotinurad (1 mg) was administered once, orally to subjects with mild (estimated glomerular filtration rate [eGFR], ≥ 60 to < 90 mL\/min\/1.73 m) or moderate (eGFR, ≥ 30 to < 60 mL\/min\/1.73 m) renal dysfunction or normal (eGFR, ≥ 90 mL\/min\/1.73 m) renal function.\nRESULTS: The time-course of mean plasma concentration of dotinurad had similar profiles across the groups. Regarding PK, there was no significant difference between the renal dysfunction groups and normal renal function group. Regarding PD, the maximum reduction rate in serum uric acid levels and the fractional uric acid excretion (FE) ratio (FE\/FE) were significantly lower in the moderate renal dysfunction group than in the normal renal function group. However, other PD parameters were not significantly different among the groups. No notable adverse events or adverse drug reactions were observed in this study.\nCONCLUSION: These results suggested that no dose adjustment might be necessary when administering dotinurad to patients with mild-to-moderate renal dysfunction.

        "Abstract":"OBJECTIVES: To test the hypothesis that allopurinol reduces the risk of acute myocardial infarction (AMI) in hyperuricemic patients and to assess whether the effect is dependent on dose, duration and serum uric acid (SUA) level attained after treatment.\nMETHODS: Nested case-control study over the period 2002-2015. From a cohort of patients aged 40-99 years old, we identified incident AMI cases and randomly selected five controls per case, matched for exact age, sex and index date. Adjusted odds ratios (AOR) and 95% CI were computed through unconditional logistic regression. Only new users of allopurinol were considered.\nRESULTS: A total of 4697 AMI cases and 18,919 controls were included. Allopurinol use was associated with a reduced risk of AMI mainly driven by duration of treatment (AOR ≥180 days = 0.71; 95% CI: 0.60-0.84). Among long-term users (≥180 days), the reduced risk was only observed when the SUA level attained was below 7 mg\/dL (AOR = 0.64; 95% CI: 0.49-0.82; AOR = 0.64; 95%CI:0.48-0.84); AOR = 1.04; 95% CI: 0.75-1.46;  for trend = 0.001). A dose-effect was observed but faded out once adjusted for the SUA level attained. The reduced risk of AMI occurred in both patients with gout and patients with asymptomatic hyperuricemia.\nCONCLUSIONS: The results confirm a cardioprotective effect of allopurinol which is strongly dependent on duration and SUA level attained after treatment.",

The aim of this study was to describe the methods used to measure and report gout flare prevention outcomes in randomized controlled trials (RCTs).\nMETHODS: A systematic search of electronic databases was conducted. Articles published between 2008 and 2018 were included if they were RCTs or articles reporting on analyses of RCT data (i.e. open label extension studies) and reported the impact of an intervention on the prevention of flares in people with gout. The modified-Jadad scale was used to assess study quality. Methods used to measure and report gout flare outcomes were extracted and synthesised separately for studies of anti-inflammatory prophylaxis and urate lowering\/other long term therapy.\nRESULTS: A total of 38 articles were included, with 10 reporting outcomes for anti-inflammatory prophylaxis and 28 for urate lowering\/other long term therapies. The overall quality score of all articles was good. There was marked heterogeneity across trials in gout flare definitions, data capture methods, reporting methods and time periods used to report flares. Anti-inflammatory prophylaxis studies used multiple methods to report gout flare outcomes (mean (SD) 4.3 (2.5) methods\/article), while the majority of urate lowering\/other long term therapy studies used a single method to report gout flare outcomes. The most common reporting method in anti-inflammatory prophylaxis studies was the mean number of gout flares per patient (n = =9 articles), and in urate lowering\/other long term therapy studies was the proportion of patients with at least one gout flare (n = =22 articles). Only studies of anti-inflammatory prophylaxis therapy reported flare duration or pain during flare.\nCONCLUSION: There is wide variation in methods used to measure and report gout flare prevention outcomes in long-term RCTs.

Patients with SU ≤ 360 µmol\/L were compared with those > 360 µmol\/L to determine factors associated with achieving SU target. Descriptive statistics and multivariate model were used. Severe disease was reported in 50%, with emergency attendances and hospitalisations in 33% and 19% respectively, and unemployment in 32%. Only 22% were at SU target and 67% on urate-lowering therapy (ULT) at recruitment. Hypertension, dyslipidaemia, chronic kidney disease and diabetes were prevalent in 56.7%, 48.2%, 32.3% and 18.8%, respectively. Malays had more comorbidities compared to Chinese participants. In multivariate analysis, ULT prescription and ≥ 2 comorbidities were associated with reaching SU target with odds ratios of 3.92 [95% confidence interval (CI) (1.75-8.71)] and 2.65 [95% CI (1.59-4.43)] respectively, independent of age, tophi, disease duration, body mass index, alcohol and diuretic use. Patients with gout have high disease burden resulting in significant healthcare utilisation. SU control is sub-optimal hence the use of ULT remains key in achieving SU target. Patients with other comorbidities are more likely to reach target than those with only gout as a single diagnosis.",

        "Abstract":"Gout is a chronic inflammatory disease caused by precipitation of urate crystals in the joints, kidneys, and urinary tract. Independent of urate deposition disorders, recent studies have shown a positive association between circulating uric acid (UA) levels and cardiovascular (CV) diseases. These results indicate that UA is a precipitating factor of both gout and the progression of CV diseases, including hypertension and\/or chronic kidney disease (CKD). A large body of evidence has shown that UA-lowering therapies are effective in preventing the progression of hypertension\/CKD and that a causal relationship exists between serum UA level and CV diseases. Despite the urgent need for effective UA-lowering drugs that can be used to obtain better therapeutic outcomes and prognosis, only few drugs have been developed in the past decades. Recently, febuxostat and topiroxostat, which are xanthine oxidoreductase inhibitors, were developed and used in clinical practice. Of note, after the approval of lesinurad, which is a urate transporter-1 (URAT-1) inhibitor, in the United States in 2015, dotinurad (Fig. 1), a novel promising drug with selective UA reabsorption inhibitory property, was recently developed in Japan in 2018. Dotinurad is indicated for patients with hyperuricemia\/gout as most patients with hyperuricemia are classified into \"underexcretion type\", which requires the inhibition of URAT-1 to excrete excess UA via the kidney. Focusing on dotinurad, the present study highlighted the multifaceted preliminary new trials that assessed for drug efficacy and safety, pharmacokinetics (PK) according to age and gender, the presence or absence of liver and kidney disorders, drug interactions with NSAID, and non-inferiority of dotinurad to either febuxostat or benzbromarone. A series of studies included in this supplemental review indicate that dotinurad reduces serum UA levels, and its efficacy and safety are similar to those of other UA-lowering agents currently used even in hyperuricemic patients with various clinical conditions. Moreover, two exploratory studies with a small sample size were conducted to compare PK parameters between patients with overproduction- and underexcretion-type hyperuricemia, and results showed that the effects of UA-lowering agents were comparable between the two subtype groups.Fig. 1Chemical structural formula of dotinurad.",

        "Published":"2019-11-22",
        "Abstract":"['P', 'P', 'P', 'P']\nBackground Uric acid (UA) is a plasmatic antioxidant that has possible effects on blood pressure. The effects of UA on endothelial function are unclear. We hypothesize that endothelial function is not impaired unless significant UA depletion is achieved through selective xanthine oxidase inhibition with febuxostat and recombinant uricase (rasburicase). Methods and Results Microvascular hyperemia, induced by iontophoresis of acetylcholine and sodium nitroprusside, and heating-induced local hyperemia after iontophoresis of saline and a specific nitric oxide synthase inhibitor were assessed by laser Doppler imaging. Blood pressure and renin-angiotensin system markers were measured, and arterial stiffness was assessed. CRP (C-reactive protein), allantoin, chlorotyrosine\/tyrosine ratio, homocitrulline\/lysine ratio, myeloperoxidase activity, malondialdehyde, and interleukin-8 were used to characterize inflammation and oxidative stress. Seventeen young healthy men were enrolled in a randomized, double-blind, placebo-controlled, 3-way crossover study. The 3 compared conditions were placebo, febuxostat alone, and febuxostat together with rasburicase. The allantoin (μmol\/L)\/UA (μmol\/L) ratio differed between sessions (<0.0001). During the febuxostat-rasburicase session, heating-induced hyperemia became altered in the presence of nitric oxide synthase inhibition; and systolic blood pressure, angiotensin II, and myeloperoxidase activity decreased (≤0.03 versus febuxostat). The aldosterone concentration decreased in the febuxostat-rasburicase group (=0.01). Malondialdehyde increased when UA concentration decreased (both <0.01 for febuxostat and febuxostat-rasburicase versus placebo). Other parameters remained unchanged. Conclusions A large and short-term decrease in UA in humans alters heat-induced endothelium-dependent microvascular vasodilation, slightly reduces systolic blood pressure through renin-angiotensin system activity reduction, and markedly reduces myeloperoxidase activity when compared with moderate UA reduction. A moderate or severe hypouricemia leads to an increase in lipid peroxidation through loss of antioxidant capacity of plasma. Clinical Trial Registration URL: http:\/\/www.clinicaltrials.gov.

        "Abstract":"Topiroxostat is a selective xanthine oxidoreductase (XOR) inhibitor for the management of hyperuricemia in patients with or without gout. In this work, we aim to employ the physiologically based pharmacokinetic (PBPK) model with the drug-target residence time model to predict and characterize both the pharmacokinetics (PK) and pharmacodynamics (PD) of topiroxostat in humans. The plasma concentration-time profile of topiroxostat was simulated based on drug properties and human physiology parameters. The predictive power of this PBPK model was then demonstrated by comparison of stimulated to observed pharmacokinetic parameters. The utility of the model was further demonstrated through predicting the oral absorption and disposition characteristics of topiroxostat in humans. Finally, by combining the PBPK model and the drug-target residence time model, we successfully predicted the target occupancy and built the relationship between PK and PD using in vitro, in vivo and in silico information. The results showed that topiroxostat exhibited significant in vivo pharmacological activity even after the complete clearance of this drug from the liver (target site), which may be due to the long residence time of the binary topiroxostat-XOR complex. This work may be helpful to guide future investigations of topiroxostat and also provides a novel strategy for PK\/PD studies.",

However, the significance of asymptomatic hyperuricemia - hyperuricemia in the absence of gout - continues to be debated.\nRECENT FINDINGS: Asymptomatic hyperuricemia results in monosodium urate crystal deposition in tissues, which may promote chronic inflammation. Intracellularly, hyperuricemia inhibits the master regulator adenosine monophosphate (AMP)-associated protein kinase and may condition innate immune responses through durable epigenetic modifications. At the population level, asymptomatic hyperuricemia is associated with multiple comorbidities, including hypertension, chronic kidney disease, coronary artery disease, and diabetes; limitations of these studies include that most are retrospective and some do not rigorously distinguish between asymptomatic hyperuricemia and gout. Treatment studies suggest that urate lowering may reduce the risk of incidence or progression of some of these comorbidities; unfortunately, many of these treatment studies are small or flawed, and not all study results are consistent.\nSUMMARY: Accumulating evidence suggests that asymptomatic hyperuricemia contributes to the comorbidities with which it associates and that proper asymptomatic hyperuricemia treatment may reduce future risk. Additional prospective trials are needed to definitely establish causality and support decision-making as to whether, and which patients with asymptomatic hyperuricemia would warrant urate-lowering treatment.",

The first phase of the study was a 6-month US follow-up after starting urate-lowering therapy (ULT) with gout flare prophylaxis. After 6 months of ULT, gout flare prophylaxis was stopped, followed by a clinical follow-up (M6 to 12) and ULT was maintained. Outcomes were the proportion of relapsing patients between M6 and M12 according to changes of US features of gout and determining a threshold decrease in tophus size according to the probability of relapse.\nRESULTS: We included 79 gouty patients (mean [±SD] age 61.8±14 years, 91% males, median disease duration 4 [IQR 1.5; 10] years). Among the 49 completers at M12, 23 (47%) experienced relapse. Decrease in tophus size≥50% at M6 was more frequent without than with relapse (54% vs. 26%, P=0.049). On ROC curve analysis, a threshold decrease of 50.8% in tophus size had the best sensitivity\/specificity ratio to predict relapse. Probability of relapse was increased for patients with a decrease in tophus size <50% between M0 and M6 (OR 3.35 [95% confidence interval 0.98; 11.44]).\nCONCLUSION: A high reduction in US tophus size is associated with low probability of relapse after stopping gout prophylaxis. US follow-up may be useful for managing ULT and gout flare prophylaxis.",

        "Abstract":"BACKGROUND: Treatment with allopurinol has been suggested to reduce the incidence of contrast-induced acute kidney injury (CI-AKI). However, results of previous randomized controlled trials (RCTs) are not consistent. We performed a meta-analysis to evaluate the influence of allopurinol on the risk of CI-AKI.\nMATERIALS AND METHODS: Related RCTs were identified via systematic search of electronic databases including PubMed, Embase, and Cochrane's Library. The influence of allopurinol on the incidence of CI-AKI was defined as the primary outcome. Results were pooled using a random-effects model or a fixed-effects model according to the heterogeneity.\nRESULTS: Five RCTs with 754 patients who underwent percutaneous coronary intervention (PCI) were included. All patients received preprocedural hydration therapy with intravenous normal saline. Pooled results showed that allopurinol significantly reduced the incidence of CI-AKI (risk ratio (RR): 0.37, p = 0.01). Subgroup analyses demonstrated that allopurinol significantly reduced the incidence of CI-AKI in high-risk patients (incidence of CI-AKI ≥ 30%, RR: 0.10, p = 0.04) but not in low-risk patients (incidence of CI-AKI < 30%, RR: 0.67, p = 0.14). Moreover, allopurinol significantly prevented the increment of serum creatinine (weighted mean difference (WMD): -0.13 mg\/dL, p < 0.001) and attenuated the loss of estimated glomerular filtration rate (WMD: 4.78 mL\/min, p = 0.04). However, serum uric acids were not significantly affected (WMD: -0.26 mg\/dL, p = 0.72).\nCONCLUSION: Pretreatment with allopurinol reduces the incidence of CI-AKI in patients undergoing contrast exposure in PCI. The benefits of allopurinol on CI-AKI may be more remarkable in high-risk patients.",

        "Abstract":"OBJECTIVE: Febuxostat, a novel non-purine selective xanthine oxidase inhibitor, is a recommended treatment option for patients with chronic kidney disease (CKD) and hyperuricemia. There are only a few trials on the long-term use of allopurinol and febuxostat for CKD. In this study, we compared the efficacy of allopurinol and febuxostat and their effects on renal function in patients with CKD and hyperuricemia.\nMATERIALS AND METHODS: This was a retrospective study of adult patients with hyperuricemia and CKD (estimated glomerular filtration rate (eGFR) ≤ 60 mL\/min\/1.73m) treated with febuxostat or allopurinol. The proportion of patients who achieved the treatment goal and the difference in efficacy between different drug doses were evaluated. Further, the effects on cardiovascular and renal functions were assessed. Cardiovascular risk is defined as cardiovascular events occurring after treatment initiation.\nRESULTS: We enrolled 316 patients in the study, with 83 and 233 patients in the allopurinol and febuxostat groups, respectively. The application of linear mixed model for analysis revealed that febuxostat 40 mg was more effective than allopurinol 100 mg in reducing the serum uric acid level. The results indicated that the long-term eGFR slope of the febuxostat group was positive, whereas that of the allopurinol group was negative.\nCONCLUSION: The results showed that, in patients with CKD and hyperuricemia, febuxostat can be used to reduce the serum uric acid level. The long-term use of febuxostat may exert a protective effect on the kidneys. Moreover, there were no obvious adverse reactions and the patients tolerated the drug well.",

        "Abstract":"We presented an update in the field of hypouricemia, which is defined as a serum urate concentration of < 2 mg\/dL (119 μmol\/L), for the practicing rheumatologist, who usually is the consulting physician in cases of disorders of urate metabolism. We performed a narrative review through a literature search for original and review articles in the field of human hypouricemia published between January 1950 and July 2018. We divided the etiology of hypouricemia into two main categories: those associated with a decrease in urate production and those promoting the elimination of urate via the kidneys. The most common conditions associated with these categories are discussed. Furthermore, the etiology of hypouricemia may be associated with certain medications prescribed by the practicing rheumatologists, such as the following: urate-lowering drugs (allopurinol and febuxostat); recombinant uricase (pegloticase); uricosuric agents (probenecid, benzbromarone); urate transporter URAT1 inhibitor (lesinurad); angiotensin II receptor blocker (losartan); fenofibrate; high-dose trimethoprim-sulfamethoxazole; some NSAID; and high-dose salicylate therapy. The rheumatologist is considered an expert in the metabolism of urate and its associated pathological conditions. Therefore, specialists must recognize hypouricemia as a biomarker of various pathological and potentially harmful conditions, highlighting the importance of conducting a deeper clinical investigation to reach a more accurate diagnosis and treatment.",

According to their uric acid-lowering therapy, there were 67 patients included in febuxostat group and 85 in allopurinol group, respectively. Estimated glomerular filtration rate (eGFR), serum creatinine (Scr), 24-h proteinuria, serum uric acid (SUA) were measured at M0, M1, M3 and M6 after the treatment. Primary outcome was proportion of patients showing ≥ 10% decline in eGFR from baseline at M6.\nRESULTS: The eGFR at M6 was numerically higher at M6 and eGFR change (M6-M0) was increased in febuxostat group compared with allopurinol group. Most importantly, the proportion of patients showing a ≥ 10% decline in eGFR from baseline at M6 was reduced in febuxostat group compared with allopurinol group. Multivariate logistic regression analyses further validated that febuxostat vs. allopurinol was an independent predictor for reduced risk of eGFR decline ≥ 10% from baseline. Besides, SUA change (M6-M0) was decreased, but Scr change (M6-M0) and 24-h proteinuria change (M6-M0) were similar in febuxostat group compared with allopurinol group.\nCONCLUSIONS: Febuxostat presents a superior effect in delaying renal impairment progression compared with allopurinol in CKD patients complicated with HUA.",

A liquid-assisted grinding (LAG) method was successfully employed, starting with the screening of various coformers for obtaining cocrystals. However, in this process, three eutectic systems with coformers (probenecid, adipic acid, and α-ketoglutaric acid) were formed. Affinities of the different functional groups to form a hydrogen bond and Δp differences, leading to the eutectic formation, were discussed. The eutectic systems thus formed were further characterized and analyzed using a differential scanning calorimeter (DSC) and powder X-ray diffraction (PXRD). Binary thermal phase diagrams were plotted using different ratios of the systems to confirm the formation of eutectics, and pH-dependent solubility studies exhibited a significant decrease in the solubility in comparison to that of the drug for all three eutectic systems. The solubility of FXT reduced from 46.53 μg\/mL (pH 5.63) to 46.03 μg\/mL, 28.53 μg\/mL, and 18.88 μg\/mL; 770.58 μg\/mL (pH 8.21) to 307.574 μg\/mL, 116.63 μg\/mL, 113.40 μg\/mL; and from 13165.97 μg\/mL (pH 10.13) to 1409.737 μg\/mL, 854.51 μg\/mL, and 1218.99 μg\/mL for FXT-probenecid, FXT-adipic acid, and FXT-α-ketoglutaric acid eutectic systems, respectively.

        "Abstract":"Gout is a chronic disease caused by monosodium urate (MSU) crystal deposition. Gout typically presents as an acute, self-limiting inflammatory monoarthritis that affects the joints of the lower limb. Elevated serum urate level (hyperuricaemia) is the major risk factor for MSU crystal deposition and development of gout. Although traditionally considered a disorder of purine metabolism, altered urate transport, both in the gut and the kidneys, has a key role in the pathogenesis of hyperuricaemia. Anti-inflammatory agents, such corticosteroids, NSAIDs and colchicine, are widely used for the treatment of gout flare; recognition of the importance of NLRP3 inflammasome activation and bioactive IL-1β release in initiation of the gout flare has led to the development of anti-IL-1β biological therapy for gout flares. Sustained reduction in serum urate levels using urate-lowering therapy is vital in the long-term management of gout, which aims to dissolve MSU crystals, suppress gout flares and resolve tophi. Allopurinol is the first-line urate-lowering therapy and should be started at a low dose, with gradual dose escalation. Low-dose anti-inflammatory therapies can reduce gout flares during initiation of urate-lowering therapy. Models of care, such as nurse-led strategies that focus on patient engagement and education, substantially improve clinical outcomes and now represent best practice for gout management.",

A choice of method of prevention is based on the results of postoperative examination with consideration of etiological factors of urinary stone disease. An analysis of influence of osteoporosis and its causative factors on the recurrence of urinary stone disease is presented in the article.\nAIM: to clarify the influence of osteoporosis and its causative factors on excretion of calcium, uric acid and recurrence of urinary stone disease.\nMATERIALS AND METHODS: A total of 86 patients after surgical treatment of urinary stone disease were included in the study. A physicochemical analysis of stones and their fragments, excretion of calcium and uric acid were done postoperatively. The risk factors for osteoporosis were identified using specific questionnaire. Bone mineral density (BMD) was assessed by X-ray densitometry. After X-ray phasic analysis of the stones and studying of the daily excretion of calcium and uric acid, 10 and 7 patients were prescribed to thiazide diuretics and allopurinol, respectively. In 69 patients (80.2%) there were no indications to the treatment and all of them were included in control surveillance group.\nRESULTS: Calcium oxalate stones were predominated in patients who were under surveillance (=0,0254). A prevalence of risk factors for osteoporosis was similar in all groups (=0,2156), as well as rate of decrease in BMD (=0,64). In patients taking thiazide diuretics, a significant decrease in daily calcium excretion was found (=0,0054) without significant changes in excretion of uric acid and diuresis volume. Among patients receiving allopurinol there was a significant decrease in daily uric acid excretion (=0,021), without significant changes in excretion of calcium and diuresis volume. There were no significant changes of these values in the control group. A recurrence of urinary stone disease in treatment group was detected in 4 patients with a decrease of BMD after 381+\/-61 days, while in control group there were 5 recurrences in patients with decreased BMD and I recurrence in patient with normal BMD after 836+\/-64 days.\nCONCLUSION: Treatment aimed at prevention of recurrence of urinary stone disease allows to correct detected metabolic disturbances. However, such factor as the decrease in BMD can influence on the rate and frequency of recurrence of urinary stone disease. A clarifying of risk factors for osteoporosis and diagnosis of osteoporosis allow to give reliable recommendations for its treatment and to decrease risk of recurrence of urinary stone disease.",

Propensity score (PS)-weighted Cox proportional hazards model was used to estimate hazard ratios (HRs) for CKD progression and improvement. A separate analysis was conducted to assess the HR for CKD progression and CKD recovery among those with worsening CKD.\nRESULTS: The incidence of CKD progression among allopurinol, febuxostat and uricosuric agent users were 1.98, 1.88 and 1.64 per 1000 person-days. Compared with allopurinol users, the PS-weighted HR (95% confidence intervals [CIs]) was 1.77 (0.85-1.76) for febuxostat users and 1.37 (0.71-1.37) for uricosuric agent users for CKD progression and 1.43 (1.26-1.62) for febuxostat users and 1.00 (0.88-1.14) for uricosuric agent users for CKD improvement. Compared to allopurinol users, the HRs for CKD progression were 1.14 (0.80-1.66) for febuxostat users and 0.92 (0.67-1.31) for uricosuric agent users. Among 741 patients who had CKD progression, the incidence of CKD recovery was 1.33, 6.21 and 3.53 per 1000 person-days for allopurinol, febuxostat and uricosuric agent users. The HRs (95% CIs) for recovery in febuxostat and uricosuric agent users were 2.17 (1.40-3.47) and 1.80 (1.20-2.83) compared to allopurinol users.\nCONCLUSIONS: CKD progression and recovery are common in gout patients using ULDs. Febuxostat and benzbromarone were associated with a similar risk of CKD progression with allopurinol, which has a poorer recovery compared with other ULDs.",

        "Abstract":"INTRODUCTION: This 24-week randomized, double-blind, non-inferiority study compared the efficacy and safety of febuxostat, a xanthine oxidase inhibitor, with allopurinol using an up-titration method in hyperuricemic Chinese subjects with or without gout.\nMETHODS: Eligible adults (serum uric acid [SUA] > 7.0 mg\/dl with a history of gout, SUA ≥ 8.0 mg\/dl with complications or SUA ≥ 9.0 mg\/dl without complications) were randomized (1:1:1) to febuxostat 40 mg\/day, 80 mg\/day, or allopurinol 300 mg\/day. Starting doses of febuxostat 20 mg\/day and allopurinol 100 mg\/day were up-titrated, up to 16 weeks, to the randomized doses and maintained to week 24. Primary endpoint was non-inferiority of febuxostat 40 mg\/day versus allopurinol 300 mg\/day based on the percentage of subjects with SUA ≤ 6.0 mg\/dl at week 24. The same comparison was made between febuxostat 60 mg\/day or 80 mg\/day versus allopurinol 300 mg\/day. Safety assessments included measurement of treatment-emergent adverse events (TEAEs).\nRESULTS: The per-protocol population comprised 472 subjects. Non-inferiority of febuxostat 40 mg\/day versus allopurinol 300 mg\/day was not demonstrated based on the protocol-defined margin of - 10% (44.7 vs. 50.0%; - 5.3% difference; 95% confidence interval [CI]: - 16.4%, 5.8%); however, superiority over allopurinol 300 mg\/day was demonstrated for febuxostat 60 mg\/day at week 16 (66.3 vs. 51.2%; a 15.0% difference; 95% CI: 4.2%, 25.9%) and febuxostat 80 mg\/day at week 24 (70.0 vs. 50.0%; a 20.0% difference; 95% CI: 9.3%, 30.7%). The frequency of TEAEs was similar across groups, with gout flares occurring frequently.\nCONCLUSIONS: Using a novel dose-titration method, although the primary endpoint of non-inferiority of febuxostat 40 mg\/day versus allopurinol 300 mg\/day was not reached, non-inferiority and superiority of febuxostat 60 mg\/day and 80 mg\/day versus allopurinol 300 mg\/day was demonstrated at weeks 16 and 24, respectively. Febuxostat demonstrated an acceptable tolerability profile in the treatment of hyperuricemia in Chinese subjects with or without gout.\nTRIAL REGISTRATION: JapicCTI-132106.\nFUNDING: Astellas Pharma Global Development, Inc.",

        "Abstract":"Uric acid is a purine degradation product but also an important antioxidant and reactive oxygen species (ROS) scavenger. Experimental settings that mimic myocardial ischemia-reperfusion have not included uric acid despite that it is always present in human extracellular fluid and plasma. We hypothesized that uric acid has an important role in myocardial ROS scavenging. Here, we tested the cardiac response to uric acid on infarct size following ischemia-reperfusion with and without exacerbated oxidative stress due to acute pressure overload and during preconditioning. We also examined mitochondrial respiration and ROS-induced mitochondrial permeability transition pore opening. Under exacerbated ROS stress induced by high-pressure perfusion, uric acid lowered oxidative stress and reduced infarct size. In contrast, uric acid blocked cardioprotection induced by ischemic preconditioning. However, this effect was reversed by probenecid, an inhibitor of cellular uptake of uric acid. In accordance, in intact cardiomyocytes, extracellular uric acid reduced the susceptibility of mitochondria towards opening of the permeability transition pore, suggesting that uric acid may prevent ischemia-reperfusion injury due to scavenging of maladaptive ROS. Moreover, as uric acid also scavenges adaptive ROS, this may interfere with preconditioning. Altogether, uric acid might be a confounder when translating preclinical experimental results into clinical treatment.",

This problem has classically been worsened by the frequent use of pharmacokinetic boosters to enhance protease inhibitors and some integrase inhibitors plasma levels. : This article focuses on the interactions between antiretroviral drugs and those drugs used to treat metabolic disturbances which frequently appear in PLWH. These include dyslipidemia, diabetes mellitus, hyperuricemia, and finally, drugs for the treatment of overweight and clinical obesity. References from PubMed, Embase, or Web of Science, among others, were reviewed. : The advent of safer drugs, in terms of DDI, in the antiretroviral and the metabolic field,such as non-boosted antiretrovirals and drugs with divergent metabolizing paths. Besides, learning by the caregivers on how to decrease and manage DDI, together with the extensive use of online updated DDI databases, has undoubtedly minimized the problem.

However, the effects and mechanism of the combination of the two medicines have not been fully reported. Therefore, to explore the effects of AR-RSG combination decoction on the treatment of chronic hyperuricemia (HUA) in rats as well as the underlying mechanisms, in this study, at the first stage, a long-term HUA rats model was established by gavage of oteracil potassium plus adenine; allopurinol was used as the positive control, and the uric acid-lowering effects of AR or RSG decoction alone with low and high dose were evaluated, respectively. Serum uric acid (UA) and xanthine oxidase (XOD) were determined mainly, and pathological analysis of the kidney and liver was carried out after sacrifice of the animals. And then, at the second stage, four dose groups of AR-RSG combination treatment were investigated in HUA rats. In addition to the indicators measured at the first stage, the expression of urate anion exchanger 1 (URAT1) in rat kidney was determined by immunohistochemistry. We discovered that the UA levels of the model group in both stages were significantly and steadily higher than those of control groups. AR and RSG alone or in combination possess ability to decrease serum UA level of HUA rats, with effects more marked in the combination groups. The uric acid-lowering mechanism of AR-RSG combination may be related to its inhibiting activity of XOD, improving kidney damage and downregulating the expression of URAT1 in kidney.",

Data including demographics, prior history of gout, clinical variables, medications, and the occurrence of PRGFs were abstracted from medical records. Forward stepwise multivariable logistic regression analysis was used in the statistical analyses.\nRESULTS: Among the 518 (0.5% [518\/114,760]) surgical patients with a prior diagnosis of gout, 474 had sufficient documentation for analysis. Of these, 191 (40.3%) had experienced a PRGF. Most PRGFs (54.4%) were polyarticular gout; 79.6% had a pretreatment pain score of PRGFs ≥7, and 59.2% required combination pharmacologic therapy. The mean (SD) serum urate (SU) level decreased postoperatively (500.33 [122.77] vs. 380.15 [118.35] μmol\/L; p = 0.000), with an average decrease of 125.86 μmol\/L. The decrease in the postsurgical SU level was greater in patients who received postoperative total parenteral nutrition (PTPN) than in those who did not (p = 0.009), and it was correlated with the duration of PTPN (r = 0.156, p = 0.031). Factors independently associated with PRGFs were decrease in the postsurgical SU level by ≥126 μmol\/L, previous flares involving the ankle, failure to take prophylactic colchicine therapy, and abdominal surgery.\nCONCLUSIONS: Recurrent gout flares often occur postoperatively and are severe. For high-risk patients, especially those undergoing abdominal surgeries, timely monitoring of postsurgical SU level, colchicine prophylaxis, and avoiding the overuse of PTPN may help prevent PRGFs.",

Randomization was carried out by a third-party institution according to random number table. Patients were randomly assigned 1:1 to febuxostat group (Feb group) (20 mg daily) or benzbromarone group (Ben group) (25 mg daily) and treated for 12 weeks. General information and biochemical data were collected at baseline and at every visit monthly. Clinical characteristics before and after the ULT were analyzed in the two groups by SPSS and EmpowerStats software.\nRESULTS: Two hundred forty patients were enrolled and randomized in the two groups, with 214 patients completing 12 weeks' ULT (105 in the Feb group and 109 in the Ben group). After 12 weeks, substantial percentages of patients in both Feb and Ben group achieved the target serum uric acid (sUA) (< 360 μmol\/L) and serum urate levels were reduced significantly for both groups (Feb 39.5% and 156.83 μmol\/L vs. Ben 35.7% and 163.99 μmol\/L). Multivariate analysis suggests baseline sUA level and renal function were associated with the outcome of the rate of achieving target sUA (RAT). Sub-group analysis suggests low doses of febuxostat and benzbromarone rendered better RAT for patients with sUA < 540 μmol\/L and creatinine clearance rate (Ccr) ≤ 110 mL min 1.73 m at baseline. The drugs were well tolerated, and the incidence of gout flares in Feb group was similar with that in Ben group (22.85% vs. 33.94%).\nCONCLUSION: Overall, febuxostat 20 mg daily and benzbromarone 25 mg daily reduced sUA, and gout patients with sUA level < 540 μmol\/L or Ccr ≤ 110 mL min 1.73 m at baseline had better chance to achieve target uric acid levels.

The 2017 British Society of Rheumatology guideline received the highest scores. Recommendations were concordant on the target serum uric acid level for long-term control, on some indications for urate-lowering therapy (ULT), and on the first-line drugs for ULT and for acute attack. Substantially inconsistent recommendations were provided for many items, especially for the timing of initiation of ULT and for treatment for asymptomatic hyperuricemia.\nCONCLUSIONS: Methodological quality needs improvement in guidance documents on gout and hyperuricemia. Evidence for certain clinical questions is lacking, despite numerous trials in this field. Promoting standard guidance development methods and synthesising high-quality clinical evidence are potential approaches to reduce recommendation inconsistencies.\nPROSPERO REGISTRATION NUMBER: CRD42016046104.",

        "Published":"2019-09-03",
        "Abstract":"The aims of this study were to determine factors that predict serum urate (SU) lowering response to allopurinol and the conversion of allopurinol to oxypurinol, and to determine a minimum therapeutic oxypurinol concentration. Data from 129 participants in a 24-month open, randomized, controlled, parallel-group, comparative clinical trial were analyzed. Allopurinol dose, SU, and plasma oxypurinol concentrations were available at multiple time points. The slope for the association between allopurinol dose and SU was calculated as a measure of sensitivity to allopurinol. The slope for the association between allopurinol dose and oxypurinol was calculated as a measure of allopurinol metabolism. Receiver operating characteristic (ROC) curves were used to identify a minimum oxypurinol concentration predictive of SU < 6 mg\/dL. There was a wide range of SU concentrations for each allopurinol dose. The relationship between sensitivity to allopurinol and allopurinol metabolism for each 100 mg allopurinol dose increase varied between individuals. Body mass index (P = 0.023), creatinine clearance (CrCL; P = 0.037), ABCG2 Q141K (P = 0.019), and SU (P = 0.004) were associated with sensitivity to allopurinol. The minimum oxypurinol concentration for achieving the urate target was found to be about 104 μmol\/L, but predictive accuracy was poor (ROC curve area under the curve (AUC) 0.65). The minimum therapeutic oxypurinol concentration was found to increase with decreasing renal function. Although there is a positive relationship between change in oxypurinol and change in SU concentration, a minimum therapeutic oxypurinol is dependent on CrCL and cannot reliably predict SU target. Other variables, including ABCG2 Q141K genotype, impact on sensitivity to allopurinol (ACTRN12611000845932).",

        "Abstract":"Background Higher serum uric acid levels are associated with cardiovascular and neurovascular disease, but whether these relationships are causal is not known. We applied Mendelian randomization approaches to assess the association between genetically determined uric acid levels and outcomes under study in large clinical trials. Methods and Results We used 28 genetic variants related to serum uric acid as instruments to perform a range of 2-sample Mendelian randomization methods. Our analysis had statistical power to detect clinically relevant effects of genetically determined serum uric acid levels on the considered clinical outcomes; cognitive function, Alzheimer disease, coronary heart disease, myocardial infarction, systolic blood pressure, and stroke. There was some suggestive evidence for an association between higher genetically determined serum uric acid and cognitive function. There was also some suggestive evidence of a relationship between coronary heart disease, systolic blood pressure, and the serum uric acid genetic instruments, but likely related to genetic pleiotropy. Overall, there was no consistent evidence of a clinically relevant effect of genetically determined serum uric acid on any of the considered outcomes. Conclusions This Mendelian randomization study does not support a clinically relevant causal effect of genetically determined serum urate on a range of cardiovascular and neurovascular outcomes. The weak association of genetically determined serum urate with coronary heart disease and systolic blood pressure may be because of pleiotropic effects. If urate lowering drugs such as allopurinol are found to affect these outcomes in clinical trials, then the effects may be mediated through urate independent mechanisms.",

        "Abstract":"INTRODUCTION\/OBJECTIVES: Lesinurad, in combination with allopurinol, has been approved for treatment of patients with gout which do not reach therapeutic serum urate target with xanthine oxidase inhibitors monotherapy. The study aimed to assess the incremental cost-effectiveness ratio of adding lesinurad to allopurinol as second-line therapy, compared to febuxostat for patients with gout in Spain.\nMETHOD: A Markov model representing disease evolution was used to estimate the lifetime accumulated cost and benefits in terms of quality-adjusted-life-year (QALY). Patients could either continue with second-line treatment with lesinurad (200 mg\/daily) plus allopurinol (400 mg\/daily) or febuxostat (80 mg\/daily) switch to allopurinol monotherapy (271 mg\/daily) in case of intolerance or discontinue treatment. The treatment's efficacy captured in the transition probabilities between health states were derived from CLEAR and EXCEL trials. Quality of life related to gout severity and flare frequency was considered by means of utilities. The total cost estimation (€, 2019) included drug acquisition cost, disease monitoring, and flare management cost. Unitary local costs derived from databases and literature. A 3% annual discount rate was applied for cost and outcomes.\nRESULTS: Lesinurad plus allopurinol provided higher QALYs (14.79) than febuxostat (14.69). Total accrued cost\/patient was lower with lesinurad and allopurinol (€50,631.51) versus febuxostat (€56,698.64). Lesinurad plus allopurinol resulted more effective and less costly (dominant option) versus febuxostat.\nCONCLUSIONS: Lesinurad plus allopurinol therapy compared with febuxostat seems an effective option for the management of hyperuricemia in patients who did not reach serum urate target to previous allopurinol monotherapy, associated to cost-savings for the Spanish Health System.Key Points• Lesinurad, in combination with allopurinol, has been recently authorized as second-line treatment of hyperuricemia in gout patients.• Lesinurad plus allopurinol provided higher effectiveness in terms of quality-adjusted-life-years (14.79) than febuxostat (14.69).• Lesinurad plus allopurinol resulted less costly (total cost\/per patient) compared with febuxostat.• Lesinurad plus allopurinol resulted a dominant option compared with febuxostat.",

Eligible patients had ≥ 1 inpatient or ≥ 2 outpatient visits with a diagnostic code for gout, filled a new index allopurinol prescription, had at least 1 posttreatment SU level measured, and met the 12-month observability rule. Treatment successes were defined as the achievement of postindex SU < 6 mg\/dl (success 1) and postindex SU < 6 mg\/dl that was sustained (success 2).\nRESULTS: Of the 198,839 unique patients with allopurinol use, 41,153 unique patients (with 47,072 episodes) and 17,402 unique patients (with 18,323 episodes) were eligible for analyses for success 1 and success 2; 42% each achieved (success 1) or achieved and maintained postindex SU < 6 mg\/dl (success 2). In multivariable-adjusted models, factors associated with significantly higher odds of both outcomes were older age, normal body mass index, Deyo-Charlson index score of 0, rheumatologist as the main provider rather than non-rheumatologist, midwestern US location for the healthcare facility, a lower hospital bed size, military service connection for medical conditions of 50% or more (a measure of healthcare access priority), longer distance to the nearest VA facility, and lower preindex SU.\nCONCLUSION: We identified novel factors associated with maintaining SU < 6 mg\/dl based on a theoretical model.

Our objective was to develop and pilot test MyGoutCare (MGC©)-a web-based, interactive educational resource for gout patients, tailored to improve knowledge.\nMETHODS: The website was developed with input from patients and experts. A health informatics expert tailored content areas so the patient could walk through a journey to learn various aspects of gout. During the pilot study, patients completed baseline demographics and a 10-item validated gout knowledge questionnaire. After reviewing the website, patients completed a post-survey within 2 weeks of their physician visit. Data were analyzed using paired t-tests and effect size (ES) was calculated for the changed scores.\nRESULTS: Gout patients and experts agreed on these content areas-triggers of flares, comorbidities, pharmacologic and non-pharmacologic treatment, healthy gout diet, and lifestyle choices. In the pilot study, 50 patients (mean age of 54 years, mean disease duration of 9.5 years, and mean 3-5 flares\/year) were recruited. Their post-survey scores (0-10) on knowledge questions improved significantly when compared to pre-survey scores with mean (SD) of 1.95 (1.76) p < 0.0001, ES = 0.95. Patients identified actionable changes moving forward after reviewing the website-decision to continue lifelong urate-lowering therapy, complying with periodic monitoring of serum urate, and making dietary changes.\nCONCLUSIONS: Web-based platforms that offer patient-focused materials can serve as a practical tool to address ongoing educational needs of gout patients.

        "Abstract":"INTRODUCTION: Clinical guidelines have recommended a target of serum uric acid (SUA) level below 6.0 mg\/dL for the urate-lowering therapy (ULT) of gout patients, but there are still a high proportion of patients failing to achieve the therapeutic target above. This study aimed to identify possible predictors of poor response to ULT in gout patients.\nMETHODS: We performed a post-hoc analysis of a multicenter randomized double-blind trial which assessed the efficacy of febuxostat in patients with hyperuricemia (serum urate level ≥ 8.0 mg\/dL) and gout. Demographic characters and baseline data including SUA levels were collected. Poor response to ULT was defined as average SUA after ULT was more than 6.0 mg\/dL. Factors associated with poor response to ULT in gout patients were analyzed, and multivariate logistic regression analysis was also carried out to find out those independent predictors.\nRESULTS: A total of 370 patients were enrolled in this post-hoc analysis. Compared with those with good response to ULT, patients with poor response to ULT had younger age (P < 0.001), higher proportion of obesity (P = 0.003), higher proportion of statins use (P = 0.019), higher body mass index (BMI) (P < 0.001), higher baseline SUA (P < 0.001), higher proportion of males (P = 0.001), higher alanine transaminase (P < 0.001), higher aspartate transaminase (P = 0.017), higher total cholesterol (P = 0.005), higher triglyceride (P = 0.042), and higher low density lipoprotein (P = 0.037). Multivariate logistic regression analysis showed that younger age (odds ratio (OR) = 0.965, 95% CI 0.943-0.987, P = 0.002), higher BMI (OR = 1.133, 95% CI 1.049-1.224, P = 0.001), higher baseline SUA (OR = 1.006, 95% CI 1.002-1.009, P = 0.001), and no application of febuxostat therapy (OR = 0.41, 95% CI 0.25-0.68, P < 0.001) were independent predictors of poor response to ULT in patients with gout.\nCONCLUSION: In patients with gout and hyperuricemia, younger age, higher BMI, and higher baseline SUA are predictors of poor response to ULT. These findings could help physicians better identify patients who may fail in ULT and give individualized treatment precisely.\nTRIAL REGISTRATION: The trial was registered at chinadrugtrials.org.cn in 2012 (CTR20130172).Key Points• A post-hoc analysis of a multicenter randomized double-blind trial which assessed the efficacy of febuxostat in patients with hyperuricemia and gout was performed.• Multivariate logistic regression analysis showed that younger age, higher BMI, and higher baseline SUA are predictors of poor response to urate-lowering therapy.",

Two radiologists assessed the images at pre-specified sites (15 in the hands\/wrists, 12 in the feet\/ankles, 4 in the knees). Clustering patterns of MSU crystal deposition and bone erosions were evaluated.\nRESULTS: Among 153 patients with gout (mean duration, 15 years) on allopurinol (mean duration, 5 years), MSU crystal deposition (67%) affected multiple sites in the hands\/wrists, feet\/ankles, and knees more often than would be expected by chance (p<0.001 for all 3 regions). In the feet\/ankles, bone erosions were also observed in a clustered manner (p<0.001).

        "Abstract":"['2', '2', '2', '2', '2', '2', '2', '2']\nTherapeutic proteins are indispensable in the treatment of various human diseases. Despite the many benefits of therapeutic proteins, they also exhibit diverse side effects. Therefore, reducing unwanted side effects of therapeutic proteins as well as enhancing their therapeutic efficacy are very important in developing therapeutic proteins. Urate oxidase (UOX) is a therapeutic enzyme that catalyzes the conversion of uric acid (UA) into a soluble metabolite, and it is used clinically for the treatment of hyperuricemia. Since UA degradation by UOX generates HO (a cytotoxic side product), UOX was co-delivered with catalase-mimic nanoparticles (AuNPs) using biocompatible pluronic-based nanocarriers (NCs) to effectively reduce HO-associated toxicity in cultured cells and to enhance UA degradation efficiency in vivo. Simple temperature-dependent size changes of NCs allowed co-encapsulation of both UOX and AuNPs at a high loading efficiency without compromising critical properties, resulting in efficient modulation of a mixing ratio of UOX and AuNPs encapsulated in NCs. Co-localizing UOX and AuNPs in the NCs led to enhanced UA degradation and HO removal in vitro, leading to a great reduction in HO-associated cytotoxicity compared with UOX alone or a free mixture of UOX and AuNPs. Furthermore, we demonstrated that co-delivery of UOX and AuNPs using NCs significantly improves in vivo UA degradation compared to simple co-injection of free UOX and AuNPs. More broadly, we showed that biocompatible pluronic-based nanocarriers can be used to deliver a target therapeutic protein along with its toxicity-eliminating agent in order to reduce side effects and enhance efficacy.",

        "Abstract":"PURPOSE OF REVIEW: The effect of urate lowering treatment (ULT) on cardiovascular (CV) risk and mortality in gout has been a topic of interest. This review discusses the CV effect of ULT and comparative CV safety among ULT agents.\nRECENT FINDINGS: The mechanism linking gout with CV risk is not fully understood but seems multifactorial involving hyperuricemia, xanthine oxidase (XO), oxidative stress, and chronic inflammation. Conflicting data exist regarding CV benefits of ULT in adults with and without hyperuricemia. Although meta-analyses on randomized controlled trials (RCTs) suggest CV benefits with allopurinol, few high-quality RCTs have examined the CV effect of ULT among patients with hyperuricemia or gout. The recent CARES trial adds new information on comparative CV safety between two XO inhibitors (XOIs), febuxostat and allopurinol, in patients with gout. It remains unclear whether ULT reduces CV risk in patients with gout or hyperuricemia. Comparative CV safety studies of XOIs suggest that additional mechanisms beyond urate-lowering effect or XO inhibition are likely involved in CV risk modification in patients with gout. Ongoing RCTs of ULT may be able to further determine the effect of ULT on CV risk.",

        "Abstract":"BACKGROUND\/OBJECTIVE: Hyperuricemia has been proven to be an independent risk factor for chronic kidney disease (CKD). However, the role of hyperuricemia in the progression of CKD remains unclear. Thus, we performed a systematic review and meta-analysis to evaluate the efficacy and safety of febuxostat, a first line urate-lowering agent, in CKD patients with hyperuricemia.\nMETHODS: We have systematically searched for randomized controlled trials assessing the efficacy and safety of febuxostat versus control in CKD patients with hyperuricemia through MEDLINE, PubMed, EMBASE, and Cochrane databases. All statistical analyses were conducted by using the statistical package Review Manager, version 5.3.5. Heterogeneity was assessed using the Cochrane Q and I tests and summary statistics were reported with 95% confidence interval. Two-tailed test was used for analysis and a P value of <.05 is considered statistically significant.\nRESULTS: Eleven eligible trials with 1317 participants were included in the meta-analysis. A significant reduction in serum uric acid was found in the febuxostat treated group. Also, a significant higher eGFR was found in the febuxostat treated group among CKD stage 3 and 4 patients. No significant difference of major complication or death was identified between treatment and control groups.\nCONCLUSIONS: The meta-analysis showed that other than its urate-lowering effect, febuxostat presented a reno-protective effect in CKD patients. More studies with larger sample sizes and higher quality are required to clarify the role of febuxostat use in the progression of CKD.",

        "Abstract":"OBJECTIVE: To examine whether a change in the presentation of incident gout happened over the last 20 years and to determine the risk of subsequent gout flares after an initial gout attack.\nMETHODS: All incident cases of gout were identified among residents of Olmsted County, Minnesota, diagnosed in 1989-1992 and 2009-2010 according to the earliest date fulfilling the 1977 American Rheumatism Association preliminary criteria, or the New York or Rome criteria for gout. Patients in both cohorts were then followed for up to 5 years. Cumulative incidence and person-year methods were used to compare flare rates, and conditional frailty models were used to examine predictors.\nRESULTS: A total of 429 patients with incident gout (158 patients in 1989-1992 and 271 patients in 2009-2010) were identified and followed for a mean of 4.2 years. The majority of patients were male (73%) and the mean age (SD) at gout onset was 59.7 (17.3) years. Classic podagra decreased significantly from 74% to 59% (p < 0.001). Cumulative incidence of first flare was similar in both cohorts (62% vs 60% by 5 yrs in 1989-1992 and 2009-2010, respectively; p = 0.70), but overall flare rate was marginally higher in 2009-2010 compared to 1989-1992 (rate ratio: 1.24). Hyperuricemia (HR 1.59) and kidney disease (HR 1.34) were significant predictors of future flares.\nCONCLUSION: Gout flares were common in both time periods. Hyperuricemia and kidney disease were predictors of future flares in patients with gout. Podagra as a presentation of gout has become relatively less frequent in recent years.",

        "Abstract":"OBJECTIVES: Previous studies have demonstrated that high-dose allopurinol is able to regress left ventricular (LV) mass in cohorts with established cardiovascular disease. The aim of this study was to assess whether treatment with high-dose allopurinol would regress LV mass in a cohort with essential hypertension, LV hypertrophy and well-controlled blood pressure but without established cardiovascular disease.\nMETHODS: We conducted a mechanistic proof-of-concept randomized, placebo-controlled, double-blind trial of allopurinol (600 mg\/day) versus placebo on LV mass regression. Duration of treatment was 12 months. LV mass regression was assessed by Cardiac Magnetic Resonance. Secondary outcomes were changes in endothelial function (flow-mediated dilatation), arterial stiffness (pulse wave velocity) and biomarkers of oxidative stress.\nRESULTS: Seventy-two patients were randomized into the trial. Mean baseline urate was 362.2 ± 96.7 μmol\/l. Despite good blood pressure control, LV mass regression was significantly reduced in the allopurinol cohort compared with placebo (LV mass -0.37 ± 6.08 versus -3.75 ± 3.89 g; P = 0.012). Oxidative stress markers (thiobarbituric acid reactive substances) were significantly higher in the allopurinol group versus placebo (0.26 ± 0.85 versus -0.34 ± 0.83 μmol\/l; P = 0.007). Other markers of vascular function were not significantly different between the two groups.\nCONCLUSION: Treatment with high-dose allopurinol in normouricemic controlled hypertensive patients and LV hypertrophy is detrimental. It results in reduced LV mass regression and increased oxidative stress over a 12-month period. This may be because of an adverse impact on redox balance. Cohort selection for future cardiovascular trials with allopurinol is crucial.",

The presence of \"severe, uncontrolled gout\" was defined as: serum uric acid ≥ 7.0 mg\/dL, ≥1 tophi and ≥2 flares in the last 12 months, and history of xanthine oxidase inhibitor treatment.\nRESULTS: Twenty-five out of 312 (8.0%) gout patients had a history of KT. Univariate analysis found that patients with gout and history of kidney transplants had: greater prevalence of severe uncontrolled gout (27% vs 8%, P = .007) and tophi (36% vs 17%, P = .030), and higher rates of failure or physician perceived contraindication to allopurinol (44% vs 23%, P = .028).\nCONCLUSION: This study provides preliminary evidence that gout in patients with history of KT is more severe and poses greater challenges to pharmacologic management. Although gout has been linked to worse outcomes among kidney recipients in the literature, there are presently no publications on gout severity among patients with KT in comparison to other patients with gout. Further investigation of disease severity and appropriate, effective treatment options in recipients of kidney transplant with a diagnosis of gout, especially prior to the transplant, is warranted.",

        "Abstract":"BACKGROUND: Provisional gout remission criteria including five domains (serum urate, tophus, flares, pain due to gout, and patient global assessment) have been proposed. The aim of this study was to test the concurrent validity of the provisional gout remission criteria by comparing the criteria with dual-energy CT (DECT) findings.\nMETHODS: Patients with gout on allopurinol ≥ 300 mg daily were prospectively recruited into a multicenter DECT study. Participants attended a standardized study visit which recorded gout flare frequency in the preceding 12 months, physical examination for tophus, serum urate, and patient questionnaires. DECT scans of both hands\/wrists, feet\/ankles\/Achilles, and knees were analyzed by two DECT radiologists. The relationship between the DECT urate crystal volume and deposition with individual domains as well as the provisional remission criteria set was analyzed.\nRESULTS: The provisional remission criteria were fulfilled in 23 (15.1%) participants. DECT urate crystal deposition was observed less frequently in those fulfilling the provisional remission criteria (44%), compared with those not fulfilling the criteria (73.6%, odds ratio 0.28, P = 0.004). The median (range) DECT urate crystal volume was 0.00 (0.00-0.46) cm for those fulfilling the remission criteria, compared with 0.08 (0.00-19.53) cm for those not fulfilling the criteria (P = 0.002). In multivariate regression analysis, the serum urate and tophus domains were most strongly associated with DECT urate crystal deposition.\nCONCLUSIONS: In people with gout established on allopurinol, a state of remission as defined by the provisional remission criteria is associated with less DECT urate crystal deposition. While this study provides support for the validity of the provisional gout remission criteria, it also demonstrates that some crystal deposition may be present in people achieving these criteria.",

Preventing Early Renal Loss in Diabetes (PERL) evaluates whether lowering SUA with allopurinol slows glomerular filtration rate (GFR) loss in people with type 1 diabetes (T1D) and mild to moderate DKD. We present the PERL rationale, design, and baseline characteristics.\nRESEARCH DESIGN AND METHODS: This double-blind, placebo-controlled, multicenter trial randomized 530 participants with T1D, estimated GFR (eGFR) of 40-99.9 mL\/min\/1.73 m, SUA ≥4.5 m\/dL, and micro- to macroalbuminuric DKD or normoalbuminuria with declining kidney function (NDKF) (defined as historical eGFR decline ≥3 mL\/min\/1.73 m\/year) to allopurinol or placebo. The primary outcome is baseline-adjusted iohexol GFR (iGFR) after 3 years of treatment plus a 2-month washout period.\nRESULTS: Participants are 66% male and 84% white. At baseline, median age was 52 years and diabetes duration was 35 years, 93% of participants had hypertension, and 90% were treated with renin-angiotensin system inhibitors (median blood pressure 127\/71 mmHg). Median HbA was 8%, SUA 5.9 mg\/dL, iGFR 68 mL\/min\/1.73 m, and historical eGFR slope -3.5 mL\/min\/1.73 m\/year. Compared with participants with albuminuria ( = 419), those with NDKF ( = 94) were significantly older (56 vs. 52 years), had lower HbA (7.7 vs. 8.1%) and SUA (5.4 vs. 6.0 mg\/dL), and had higher eGFR (82 vs. 74 mL\/min\/1.73 m) and historical eGFR loss (-4.7 vs. -2.5 mL\/min\/1.73 m\/year). These differences persisted when comparing groups with similar rates of historical eGFR loss.\nCONCLUSIONS: PERL will determine the effect of allopurinol on mild to moderate DKD in T1D, with or without albuminuria. Participants with normoalbuminuria and rapid GFR loss manifested many DKD risk factors of those with albuminuria, but with less severity.",

Adherence to guidelines has not been well studied, and the correlation between uric acid reduction and clinically relevant outcomes, such as acute kidney injury, remains unclear. Our study aims to describe rasburicase utilization patterns and outcomes in cancer patients with varying risks for tumor lysis syndrome.\nMETHODS: In this retrospective cohort study, we included cancer inpatients who received rasburicase for tumor lysis syndrome management at two affiliated academic hospitals from 2009 to 2015. Patients were classified by tumor lysis syndrome risk categories prior to drug administration. Primary outcomes included acute kidney injury incidence and renal recovery. Secondary outcomes included uric acid nadir, mortality, and hospital length-of-stay.\nRESULTS: Among 164 patients, 42 (26%) had high-, 63 (38%) had intermediate-, and 59 (36%) had low-risk for tumor lysis syndrome. A total of 94 patients (57%) had existing renal dysfunction prior to rasburicase use. This occurred more frequently in low- (68%) compared to intermediate- (57%) and high- (43%) risk patients ( = 0.044). A greater proportion of patients in the high-risk group (78%) had renal recovery when compared to the intermediate- (61%) or low- (45%) risk groups ( = 0.056). Despite a similar length of stay, the high-risk group had a significantly lower 30-day mortality (10%) when compared to intermediate- (25%) or low- (32%) risk groups ( = 0.029).\nCONCLUSIONS: Our results suggest that rasburicase may be frequently prescribed to treat hyperuricemia unrelated to tumor lysis syndrome in cancer patients. Improved education and adherence to guidelines may improve clinical and economic outcomes associated with rasburicase administration.",

        "Abstract":"BACKGROUND: Systemic inflammatory diseases have been associated with increased risk of venous thromboembolism. We aimed to quantify the risk of venous thromboembolism in patients with gout, the most common inflammatory arthritis, and to assess how disease duration, hospital admission and urate-lowering therapy affect this risk.\nMETHODS: We used data from the population-representative, England-based Clinical Practice Research Datalink linked to Hospital Episode Statistics, to identify incident gout cases between 1998 and 2017. We matched cases individually to 1 control without gout on age, gender, general practice and follow-up time. We calculated absolute and relative risks of venous thromboembolism, stratified by age, gender and hospital admission. Among those with gout, we assessed the risk of venous thromboembolism by exposure to urate-lowering therapy.\nRESULTS: We identified 62 234 patients with incident gout matched to 62 234 controls. Gout was associated with higher risk of venous thromboembolism compared with controls (absolute rate 37.3 [95% confidence interval (CI) 35.5-39.3] v. 27.0 [95% CI 25.5-28.9] per 10 000 person-years, adjusted hazard ratio [HR] 1.25, 95% CI 1.15-1.35). The excess risk in patients with gout, which was sustained up to a decade after diagnosis, was present during the time outside hospital stay (adjusted HR 1.30, 95% CI 1.18-1.42), but not during it (adjusted HR 1.01, 95% CI 0.83-1.24). The risk of venous thromboembolism was similar among patients prescribed versus not prescribed urate-lowering therapy (incidence rate ratio 1.04, 95% CI 0.89-1.23).\nINTERPRETATION: Gout was associated with higher risk of venous thromboembolism, particularly when the patient was not in hospital and regardless of exposure to urate-lowering therapy. Although the observed excess risk may not be sufficient to warrant preventive intervention, clinical vigilance may be required when caring for these patients.",

Patients were divided into \"adherent to medical therapy\" (compliance with potassium citrate ± allopurinol verified by computerized pharmacy data) or nonadherent groups. Primary outcomes were CT stone recurrence rate and need for surgical stone intervention.\nRESULTS: We found 28 of 53 (53%) adherent and 25 of 53 (47%) nonadherent individuals (14 declined medication, 11 intolerant). With median follow-up of 24 months, no significant differences were noted between groups in regards to stone recurrence (32%; P = .99) or in 24-hour urine pH compared to baseline or follow-up (range 5.46-5.62; P = 0.06). Adherent patients, however, had smaller CT stone recurrence sizes (6.3 ± 3.8 vs 11.8 ± 6.2 mm, P = .02), were 28% less likely to require stone surgery compared to those without therapy (P <.01), and trended toward longer time intervals without recurrence (23.1 ± 18.8 vs 10.5 ± 7.5 months, P = .10) compared to nonadherents. Study confounders included a variety of medication dosages and adherences, limited nonadherent follow-up, and small study number.\nCONCLUSION: UASF adherent to medical therapy had smaller recurrence sizes and fewer surgical interventions vs nonadherent, highlighting the protective role of potassium citrate in UA stone disease.

Between June 2017 and June 2018, the augmentation index (AI) was measured using SphygmoCor for patients with gout who visited the Jeju National University Hospital in South Korea. Patients were divided into the following groups: group with tophi and group without tophi. Medical records, laboratory data, and AI were retrospectively analyzed. One hundred and twenty patients with gout or participated in the study, with most (96.7%) of the patients being male. The mean duration of the disease was 7.0 years. At the time of the examination, 99 patients (82.5%) were treated with a uric acid-lowering agent. Of the total patients, 24 (19.7%) had tophi. Patients with tophi were significantly older (60.2 ± 11.6 years vs. 53.8 ± 13.0 years, p = 0.031), had longer disease duration (13.0 ± 6.5 years vs 5.5 ± 5.4 years, p < 0.001), and higher AI@75 (28.7 ± 7.8 vs 20.9 ± 10.0, p = 0.001) than those without tophi. In the multiple linear regression analysis, tophi was shown to be a significant predictor of high AI (p = 0.040). The presence of tophi is a predictor of increased arterial stiffness in patients with gout. Therefore, more strict control of cardiovascular disease risk factors is needed in the treatment of patients with tophi.",

Adherence to urate-lowering therapy (ULT) can be difficult for patients due to barriers, which include medication burden, financial hardship, and lack of medical literacy. Our aim was to create a pharmacist-managed referral for the titration of ULT to target serum uric acid (sUA) levels in a complex patient population. We utilized a clinical database to query patients seen at a rheumatology clinic over a 12-month period with an ICD-10 diagnosis for gout. The referral criteria were indications for ULT per the 2012 ACR guidelines. Rheumatology providers, consisting of attendings, fellows, and a physician assistant, were asked to refer the identified patients to the pharmacist-managed titration program. The intervention group consisted of 19 referred patients and the control group consisted of 28 non-referred patients. The baseline sUA (median (IQR)) at the time of referral was 8.8 (2) mg\/dL for the intervention group and 7.6 (2.8) mg\/dL for the control group (p = 0.2). At the end of the study period, the sUA was 6.1 (1.4) mg\/dL for the intervention group and 6.8 (3.2) mg\/dL for the control group (p = 0.08). At the end of the study period, 6 of 19 (32%) intervention group and 7 of 28 (25%) control group were at goal (p = 0.3).

        "Abstract":"As an important part of the comprehensive treatment methods, the urate-lowering Chinese herbs could provide favorable clinical effects on hyperuricemia in its ability to invigorate spleen and remove dampness. Owing to the long-term duration, it brought up the potential adverse reactions (ADRs) and concerns about the drug-induced liver injury from these herbs. To address this problem, the bioinformatics approaches which combined the network pharmacology, computer simulation and molecular biology experiments were undertaken to elucidate the underlying drug-induced liver injury molecular mechanisms of urate-lowering Chinese herbs. Several electronic databases were searched to identify the potential liver injury compounds in published research. Then, the putative target profile of liver injury was predicted, and the interaction network was constructed based on the links between the compounds, corresponding targets and core pathways. Accordingly, the molecular docking simulation was performed to recognize the representative compounds with hepatotoxicity. Finally, the cell experiments were conducted to investigate the biochemical indicators and expression of the crucial protein that were closely associated with liver injury. In conclusion, the current research revealed that the compounds with potential liver injury including diosgenin, baicalin, saikosaponin D, tetrandrine, rutaecarpine and evodiamine from urate-lowering Chinese herbs, could lead to decline the survival rate of L-02 cell, increase the activities of aspartate aminotransferase (AST), alanine aminotransferase (ALT), lactate dehydrogenase (LDH) and alkaline phosphatase (ALP) in cell-culture medium, enhance the expression of p-p38\/p38, while the p38 inhibitor could achieve the trend of regulating and controlling liver injury. These research findings bring further support to the growing evidence that the mechanism of the liver injury induced by the compounds from urate-lowering Chinese herbs may be associated with the activation of p38α.",

Mean sU decrement by dosing per CKD groups was determined by CKD stage.\nRESULTS: Of 1,288 subjects with gout, 180 met entry criteria, with 83 subjects receiving 100 mg and 97 receiving 300 mg allopurinol. Subjects with CKD stage 1 experienced less sU lowering with 100 mg than 300 mg of allopurinol. Subjects with stage 4 and 5 CKD had equivalent sU decreases across the 100 mg and 300 mg allopurinol groups. However, the 100 mg group started at a higher pre-treatment sU and ended at a higher final sU than the 300 mg group.\nCONCLUSIONS: The strategy of titrating allopurinol to sU in patients with kidney impairment may result in greater sU lowering at lower doses than in patients without CKD but may also pose a treatment challenge from a possible drug ceiling effect.",

Benefits of hyperuricemia treatment with allopurinol have not yet been confirmed in clinical practice. The aim of our work was to assess the benefit of allopurinol treatment in a large cohort of HF patients.\nMETHODS: The prospective acute heart failure registry (AHEAD) was used to select 3160 hospitalized patients with a known level of uric acid (UA) who were discharged in a stable condition. Hyperuricemia was defined as UA ≥500 μmoL\/L and\/or allopurinol treatment at admission. The patients were classified into three groups: without hyperuricemia, with treated hyperuricemia, and with untreated hyperuricemia at discharge. Two- and five-year all-cause mortality were defined as endpoints. Patients without hyperuricemia, unlike those with hyperuricemia, had a higher left ventricular ejection fraction, a better renal function, and higher hemoglobin levels, had less frequently diabetes mellitus and atrial fibrillation, and showed better tolerance to treatment with angiotensin-converting enzyme inhibitors\/angiotensin receptor blockers and\/or beta-blockers.\nRESULTS: In a primary analysis, the patients without hyperuricemia had the highest survival rate.

At year 2, patients in the control group who had an SU level of <0.36 mmoles\/liter and patients in the dose-escalation group had reduced DECT urate volume (-27.6 to -28.3%), whereas reduction in DECT urate volume was not observed in control group patients with an SU level of ≥0.36 mmoles\/liter (+1.5%) (P = 0.023).\nCONCLUSION: These findings provide evidence that long-term urate-lowering therapy using a treat-to-SU-target strategy can influence structural damage and reduce urate crystal deposition in gout.",

        "Abstract":"Serum urate is correlated with blood pressure (BP), and lowering urate may decrease BP, but a consistent effect has not been observed. Here, we evaluated whether pegloticase, a recombinant uricase conjugated to polyethylene glycol, which can lead to persistently low serum urate levels (<1 mg\/dL), can modulate BP in subjects with chronic refractory gout. This post hoc analysis used results from two 6-month randomized clinical trials in which subjects were treated with 8 mg pegloticase every 2 or 4 weeks (q2w or q4w) or placebo. Responders in this study were defined as those individuals in whom a persistently low urate level (<6 mg\/dL and usually <1 mg\/dL) was maintained. Serial sitting BP was measured in 173 subjects, and estimated glomerular filtration rate was determined at baseline and after 3 and 6 months. Significant reductions in mean arterial pressure (MAP) from baseline to 6 months were noted in q2w responders ( P=0.0028), whereas reductions in MAP in other groups were not significant. Significant decreases in both systolic and diastolic BP paralleled the change in MAP. Of the 62% of q2w responders exhibiting persistent decreases in MAP, there were no significant differences in baseline age, sex, race, weight, body mass index, history of hypertension, hyperlipidemia, history of coronary artery disease, gout duration, MAP, serum urate, estimated glomerular filtration rate or urinary uric acid\/creatinine ratio compared with those who did not lower MAP. No significant changes in estimated glomerular filtration rate occurred in any of the groups during the study. Responders to biweekly pegloticase who maintained a persistently lower serum urate level throughout the trial experienced significant reductions in both systolic and diastolic BP that were independent of changes in renal function.

We performed a randomized, double-blind, placebo-controlled, phase I study to evaluate the safety, tolerability, pharmacodynamic, and pharmacokinetic profiles of URC102 after single and multiple oral administration in healthy male subjects.\nMETHODS: Thirty-one Koreans and 23 Caucasians received a single dose of URC102 at 1-30 mg and 1-10 mg, respectively, while 44 Koreans received URC102 once-daily for 7 days at 1-20 mg. We evaluated safety and tolerability throughout the study, and serially determined serum uric acid, the fractional excretion of uric acid and URC102 concentrations.\nRESULTS: URC102 was well tolerated over the dose range of 1-10 mg after single and multiple administration. URC102 rapidly reduced serum uric acid, which was maintained over the entire treatment period. Furthermore, URC102 increased the area-under-the-effect curve over 168 h for fractional excretion of uric acid in a dose-dependent manner. The maximum plasma concentration and the area under the plasma concentration-time curve of URC102 increased dose-proportionally. The pharmacokinetic and pharmacodynamics characteristics of URC102 were similar in Koreans and Caucasians.\nCONCLUSION: URC102 was safe and effectively lowered serum uric acid, which should be tested and confirmed in patients with hyperuricaemia and\/or gout through further studies.\nTRIAL REGISTRATION: ClinicalTrials.gov, www.clinicaltrials.gov, NCT01953497 and NCT02524678.",

Demographic and clinical data were obtained at baseline. Visits included assessments of serum urate, flares, tophus burden, health-related quality of life using the EQ-5D, activity limitations using the Health Assessment Questionnaire adapted for gout, and pain level and patient's global assessment using visual analog scales. Treatment for gout and associated diseases was prescribed according to guidelines and available drugs.\nRESULTS: Of 500 patients studied, 221 had severe gout (44%) and 279 had non-severe gout (56%) at baseline. No significant differences were observed across the study in percentages of severe gout versus non-severe gout patients achieving SU 6 mg\/dl or 5 mg\/dl. The highest proportion of patients achieving target SU (50-70%) and remission (39%) were found after 3-4 years of followup. In the fifth year, these proportions decreased and 28% of the patients were in remission, but only 40 patients remained in the study. None of the patients with severe gout achieved remission.\nCONCLUSION: In patients with severe gout, target SU was hard to achieve and remission was not possible.

        "Abstract":"The prevalence of hyperuricemia and chronic kidney disease (CKD) has been steadily increasing. The role of hyperuricemia and efficacy of uric acid-lowering agents against CKD progression remain controversial. This study aimed to evaluate the effect of hyperuricemia and uric acid-lowering agents on the progression of CKD. A total 2042 patients with CKD were analyzed in the KoreaN cohort Study for Outcomes in patients With Chronic Kidney Disease (KNOW-CKD), a prospective cohort study. Patients were classified into quartiles on the basis of their serum uric acid level and the prevalence of advanced CKD was higher in patients with a high uric acid level. A composite renal outcome was defined as one or more of the following: initiation of dialysis or transplantation, a two-fold increase in baseline serum creatinine levels, or a 50% decline in the estimated glomerular filtration rate during the follow-up period. A Cox proportional hazard ratio model was applied to analyze the relationship between composite renal outcome and uric acid levels. The risk of progression to renal failure increased by 28% (hazard ratio [HR], 1.277; 95% confidence interval [CI], 1.212-1.345) for each 1 mg\/dl increase in the baseline uric acid level. In multivariate models, an association was found between the highest quartile of uric acid and increased risk of composite renal outcome (HR, 3.590; 95% CI, 2.546-5.063). A propensity score matching analysis was performed to survey the effect of uric acid lowering agent. Both allopurinol and febuxostat did not affect the renal outcome. In conclusion, hyperuricemia appears to be an independent risk factor for composite renal outcome, but allopurinol and febuxostat did not show reno-protective effect.",

        "Abstract":"Lowering serum urate levels below the threshold for crystal formation with urate-lowering therapy (ULT) has been associated with a lower risk for gout flare reoccurrences. However, gout patients on ULT still commonly suffer from recurring gout flares. The purpose of this study was to explore prognostic factors associated with gout flare recurrence within the first 3 months, in gout patients starting ULT during an acute gout flare. Post-hoc analysis of trial data on acute gout patients randomized to either gout flare standard of care or anakinra treatment were used, including baseline demographic, laboratory, clinical, and patient-reported variables, as well as 3-month follow-up data on gout flare recurrences. Only patients starting ULT at baseline were included. Using variable selection based on clinical relevance, univariate, and multivariate binary logistic regression analyses were done to examine predictors of gout flare reoccurrence. A total of 75 patients were included in this study, of which 36 (48%) experienced a gout flare ≤ 3 months post baseline. The multivariate regression analysis revealed that CRP levels > 30 mg\/L (OR 9.47) and lack of prophylaxis when starting ULT (OR 11.56) were independently associated with gout flare recurrence. Similar results were found for the univariate regression analyses. Our results show that CRP levels > 30 mg\/L and lack of prophylaxis when starting ULT were prognostic factors for early gout flare reoccurrence in patients starting ULT during an acute gout flare. KEY POINTS: • Gout flare recurrences were common within the first 3 months after starting urate-lowering therapy in gout patients. • Intake of prophylaxis when starting ULT had a strong protective effect on gout flare recurrences. • C-reactive protein level > 30 mg\/L was an additional prognostic factor for early (≤ 3 months) gout flare reoccurrence in patients starting ULT during an acute gout flare.",

        "Abstract":"['2', '2']\nMassive lysis of tumor mass in cancer patients under chemotherapy regimens generates high levels of uric acid, leading to what is known as tumor lysis syndrome (TLS). Rasburicase, a recombinant urate oxidase, converts urate to allantoin, which is readily excreted by the kidneys. Even though there is a high production of allantoin from urate in cancer patients following rasburicase treatment, there are no studies on how allantoin excess could interfere with chemotherapy. We have evaluated allantoin interference with cisplatin efficiency on the lung cancer cell line H460 in vitro. The cells were treated with cisplatin (33 µM), with or without allantoin, for 48 h, in the presence or absence of UV light, and N-acetyl-L-cysteine (NAC) for 24 h. Cell viability, cell cycle, ROS production, apoptosis and immunoblot assays were performed. We showed that allantoin reduced the apoptosis induced by cisplatin in the H460 cell line. However, the activity of carboplatin and oxaliplatin, betulinic acid, TIBA, UV and HO was not affected by allantoin. NMR spectroscopy showed that allantoin reduces cisplatin activity through direct interaction with cisplatin.",

        "Abstract":"Studies have demonstrated the presence of a strong association between serum uric acid (SUA) and acute kidney injury (AKI) consistently across several disease models. Exposure to SUA at different time periods and concentrations has reliably resulted in AKI whether assessed by conventional or novel biomarkers or by kinetic estimated glomerular filtration rate (KeGFR) engineered for non-steady dynamic states. In experimental models, moderate hyperuricemia was associated with an absence of intrarenal crystals, manifestation of tubular injury, macrophage infiltration, and increased expression of inflammatory mediators that were attenuated with uric acid lowering therapy with rasburicase, a recombinant urate oxidase. In a pilot clinical trial, treatment with rasburicase was associated with a decreased incidence of AKI and evidence for less renal structural injury. Lowering SUA also improved KeGFR and estimated glomerular filtration rate in 2 separate studies. SUA has also been linked to diabetic nephropathy, hypertension, cardiovascular disease, chronic kidney disease, metabolic syndrome, and their mechanisms of action share many common traits. In this article, we explore the evidence for the causal role of SUA in AKI using Bradford Hill criteria as a guideline with data integration from related fields.",

We assessed the serum concentrations of free thiols (FT) and uric acid (SUA), together constituting a large part of nonenzymatic serum antioxidant capacity, as well as total antioxidant status (TAS) with reference to IBD phenotype, activity, co-occurrence of anemia, and treatment with azathioprine (AZA) and corticosteroids (CS). Additionally, we appraised the potential of uric acid, thiol stress, and TAS as mucosal healing (MH) markers in ulcerative colitis. : SUA, FT, and TAS were measured colorimetrically using, respectively, uricase, Ellman's and 2,2'-azino-bis-3-ethylbenzthiazoline-6-sulphonic acid (ABTS) methods. : The study group consisted of 175 individuals: 57 controls, 71 ulcerative colitis (UC), and 47 Crohn's disease (CD) patients.

In case 1, a 45-year-old man developed AKI after taking 100 mg of benzbromarone. His serum creatinine (Scr) increased to 2.3 mg\/dL on day 2 after benzbromarone administration. Ultrasound showed multiple small stones in both kidneys, and the 24-hour urine uric acid level was 3128 mg. In case 2, a 17-year-old male student presented with AKI after self-administration of 50 mg of benzbromarone. His Scr increased to 6.8 mg\/dL on day 3 after benzbromarone administration.

The aim of the present meta-analysis is to evaluate the efficacy and safety of febuxostat as a preventive measure in patients at risk of tumour lysis syndrome development, by comparing it with allopurinol administration.\nMETHODS: MEDLINE, Scopus, Cochrane Central Register of Controlled Trials, Clinicaltrials.gov and Google Scholar databases were searched from inception to 15 December 2018. All studies evaluating the effectiveness of febuxostat in preventing tumour lysis syndrome were held eligible.\nRESULTS AND DISCUSSION: Six studies were included with a total of 658 patients. Compared to allopurinol, febuxostat achieved a similar response rate (OR: 1.39, 95% CI: [0.55, 3.51]) and tumour lysis syndrome incidence (OR: 1.01, 95% CI: [0.56, 1.81]).

A questionnaire survey including ten gout-related questions was conducted among 298 physicians in Beijing. Demographic data and previous gout CME experience were collected. Chi-square test or Student's  test, univariate analysis and logistic regression analysis were used to evaluate the relevant factors of physicians' knowledge level.  A total of 250 valid copies were collected including 127 from community service centers (CSC), 123 from tertiary hospitals. The correct answer rate of gout etiology, pathogenesis and attack symptoms were over 70% in both groups. 45.5% (56\/123) CSC doctors and 57.4% (66\/115) tertiary doctors answered right drugs to control acute gout attack (0.067). Only 42.3% (52\/123) in CSC and 53.4% (63\/118) in hospitals chose allopurinol as a urate-lowering drug (ULT), while 46.3% (57\/123) and 32.2% (38\/118) doctors considered colchicine as a ULT drug (0.084) respectively. Near half doctors considered that gout patients should take long-term ULT [40.5% (51\/126) vs. 57.6%(68\/118)respectively, 0.007]. Univariate analysis showed that CME training could improve gout-related knowledge in CRC doctors.  Most CSC doctors generally understand basic knowledge of gout, while confusion of treatment is still significant. CME especially including standard gout treatment should be performed by doctors in tertiary hospitals.",

        "Abstract":"INTRODUCTION: Urate-lowering therapy (ULT) is the cornerstone of gout management, which is a widespread chronic illness characterized by hyperuricemia, arthropathy, tophus development, and urolithiasis. Since asymptomatic increased serum urate levels are associated with a higher risk of cardiovascular, renal and metabolic disorders, a larger use of ULTs in the general population is expected in the near future.\nAREAS COVERED: This review will focus on the safety and tolerability profile of the available urate-lowering drugs: xanthine oxidase inhibitors (XOIs), uricosuric agents and injectable uricases.\nEXPERT OPINION: Older drugs for ULT like allopurinol are well studied and extensively described from typical adverse effects (mild skin rash) to unusual fatal reactions, while febuxostat seems to be overall well tolerated. More evidence is required to define the safety profile of topiroxostat, arhalofenate, tranilast, and sulfinpyrazone. Furthermore, there are some unanswered questions about the pharmacological interactions of probenecid and the hepatotoxicity of benzbromarone. Despite a limited use in clinical practice, combination therapy with lesinurad or verinurad and XOI is not frequently accompanied by side effects. Rasburicase and pegloticase are usually well tolerated with some specific exceptions. Before prescribing UL drugs, physicians should take into account their safety profile tailoring the treatment on the patient characteristics.",

This study investigated the effect of allopurinol (uric acid synthesis inhibitor) in combination with metformin and vitamin E in prevention of fructose induced-fatty liver in rats.\nMATERIAL AND METHODS: Rats were divided into 7 groups: control group, fructose group (model group of NAFLD), allopurinol-treated group, metformin-treated group, vitamin E-treated group, metformin plus vitamin E-treated group and a combination group (received allopurinol plus metformin plus vitamin E). Development of NAFLD was assessed biochemically by serum alanine aminotransferase (ALT) and aspartate aminotransferase (AST) as well as by histopathological examination. Oxidative stress parameters [reduced glutathione (GSH), superoxide dismutase (SOD), malondialdehyde (MDA)], and the inflammatory mediators tumor necrosis factor α (TNF-α) and inducible nitric oxide synthase (iNOS) were assessed, along with serum levels of uric acid and triglyceride (TG).\nRESULTS: Combination of allopurinol plus metformin plus vitamin E significantly attenuated fatty changes compared to their respective monotherapy. Interestingly, though all treated groups showed significant attenuation in the oxidative stress markers, TNF-α level and iNOS immunostaining in hepatic tissue, along with a significant decrease in the levels of uric acid and TG, the combination group showed a further significant decrease in the serum level of uric acid and iNOS immunostaining compared to other treated regimens.\nCONCLUSIONS: Allopurinol synergistically increases the protective effect of metformin and vitamin E in treatment of NAFLD, namely via reduction of uric acid synthesis and iNOS expression.",

        "Abstract":"OBJECTIVE: A systematic review and meta-analysis were conducted to investigate the associations of hyperuricemia, gout, and uric acid (UA)-lowering therapy with the risk of fractures.\nMETHODS: Electronic searches on PubMed, the Cochrane Library, and Embase were conducted from inception to January 2, 2019. Observational studies assessing the effects of hyperuricemia, gout, and UA-lowering therapy on fractures were included in the meta-analysis. Summary risk estimates with 95% confidence intervals (CI) were calculated by a random-effects model.\nRESULTS: A total of 14 eligible studies with 909 803 participants and 64 047 incident fractures were included. The results suggested that hyperuricemia and gout are not associated with any type of fracture (relative risk [RR], 0.98, 95% CI 0.85-1.11; P = 0.71) or osteoporotic fractures (RR, 1.02, 95% CI 0.90-1.14; P = 0.79). Further analysis indicated that hyperuricemia is associated with a lower risk of fractures (RR, 0.80, 95% CI 0.66-0.96; P = 0.02) but not with osteoporotic fractures (RR, 0.84, 95% CI 0.68-1.03; P = 0.10). However, gout is associated with an increased risk of fractures (RR, 1.17, 95% CI 1.04-1.31; P = 0.007) as well as osteoporotic fractures (RR, 1.13, 95% CI 1.00-1.26; P = 0.045). Furthermore, no significant association of UA-lowering therapy with the risk of fractures was found compared with the placebo (RR, 0.88, 95% CI 0.76-1.03; P = 0.11). Evidence supporting a non-linear association between serum UA levels and fractures was found (P < 0.001 for non-linearity), which revealed a U-shaped curve.\nCONCLUSION: Our meta-analysis revealed that hyperuricemia was associated with lower risk for any type fracture but not associated with osteoporotic fractures; however, gout was associated with an increased risk of any type fracture as well as osteoporotic fractures. Notably, a U-shaped relationship may exist between the serum UA level and fractures. The associations observed in our study may be due to reasons other than causality.",

        "Abstract":"BACKGROUND: ABCG2 is a high-capacity urate transporter that plays a crucial role in renal urate overload and extra-renal urate underexcretion. Previous studies have suggested an association between hyperuricemia and gout susceptibility relative to dysfunctional ABCG2 variants, with rs2231142 (Q141K) being the most common. In this study, we analyzed the ABCG2 gene in a hyperuricemia and gout cohort focusing on patients with pediatric-onset, i.e., before 18 years of age.\nMETHOD: The cohort was recruited from the Czech Republic (n = 234) and consisted of 58 primary hyperuricemia and 176 gout patients, with a focus on pediatric-onset patients (n = 31, 17 hyperuricemia\/14 gouts); 115 normouricemic controls were used for comparison. We amplified, sequenced, and analyzed 15 ABCG2 exons. The chi-square goodness-of-fit test was used to compare minor allele frequencies (MAF), and the log-rank test was used to compare empirical distribution functions.\nRESULTS: In the pediatric-onset cohort, two common (p.V12M, p.Q141K) and three very rare (p.K360del, p.T421A, p.T434M) allelic ABCG2 variants were detected. The MAF of p.Q141K was 38.7% compared to adult-onset MAF 21.2% (OR = 2.4, P = 0.005), to the normouricemic controls cohort MAF 8.5% (OR = 6.8, P <  0.0001), and to the European population MAF 9.4% (OR = 5.7, P <  0.0001). The MAF was greatly elevated not only among pediatric-onset gout patients (42.9%) but also among patients with hyperuricemia (35.3%). Most (74%) of the pediatric-onset patients had affected family members (61% were first-degree relatives).\nCONCLUSION: Our results show that genetic factors affecting ABCG2 function should be routinely considered in a hyperuricemia\/gout diagnosis, especially in pediatric-onset patients. Genotyping of ABCG2 is essential for risk estimation of gout\/hyperuricemia in patients with very early-onset and\/or a family history.",

        "Abstract":"Cardiovascular disease affects more than 90 million Americans. Recent studies support an increased cardiovascular disease risk in inflammatory conditions, such as gout. Increased serum urate levels, or hyperuricemia, are a precursor to gout. Data from meta-analyses have shown hyperuricemia to be linked to hypertension and coronary heart disease. Similarly, gout has been associated with an increased risk of myocardial infarction, cerebrovascular accidents, and death from cardiovascular disease in randomized clinical trials. Urate-lowering therapy reduces serum urate and may decrease systemic inflammation, generation of oxidative species, and reverses endothelial dysfunction through hyperuricemia-dependent or hyperuricemia-independent pathways. Cardioprotective benefits of allopurinol, a first-line agent for the treatment of gout, have been demonstrated to potentially prevent myocardial infarction, stroke, atrial fibrillation, and other cardiovascular diseases in observational studies in select populations. Randomized controlled trials (RCTs) have also examined the role of newer urate-lowering therapies, such as febuxostat and lesinurad, and their risk of cardiovascular-specific mortality in comparison to allopurinol. A large post-marketing study of febuxostat vs. allopurinol showed higher all-cause and cardiovascular-specific mortality in the febuxostat group than in the allopurinol group; a major study limitation was that large numbers of patients were lost to follow-up or discontinued treatment. RCTs are required to assess the comparative effectiveness of urate-lowering therapies, validate findings of observational studies, and to determine which subgroup populations of gout are most likely to benefit from appropriate long-term urate-lowering therapy. This review examines the data for increased cardiovascular disease in gout and potential underlying mechanisms (including hyperuricemia, inflammation, endothelial dysfunction, oxidative stress) and the effect of urate-lowering therapy on cardiovascular disease.",

The effect of urate lowering drugs (ULT) and, in particular, the xanthine oxidase inhibitor in patients with HF is controversial. The aim of the study is to compare the effects of treatment with two different xanthine oxidase inhibitors (allopurinol or febuxostat) on cardiovascular mortality in elderly patients with chronic HF in a setting of clinical practice. In this observational trial, 255 elderly patients affected by chronic HF and treated with ULT on top of optimal medical treatment for HF. The sample included only outpatients with mild-to-moderate HF mainly secondary to chronic arterial hypertension or coronary artery disease and not previously hospitalized for HF. Patient treated with febuxostat (N. 120) and allopurinol (N. 135) were balanced for most of the baseline variables. In particular age, NYHA class distribution, drug treatment and renal function were comparable at the baseline and during the observation in both groups (p > 0.05). After a mean follow-up period of 5.1 years, the cumulative cardiovascular survival was 0.96 (95% CI 0.93-0.99) in febuxostat-treated patients and 0.89 (95% CI 0.84-0.93) in those treated with allopurinol. The between group difference, adjusted for the main confounding risk factors, was statistically significant (p = 0.04). Our study results suggest that possibility that febuxostat, a selective XO inhibitor, may favorably affect cardiovascular mortality in comparison with allopurinol in elderly patients with mild-to-moderate HF.

Dissolution therapy for UA kidney stones via urinary alkalization has been described as a treatment option. We present our experience in treating UA nephrolithiasis with medical dissolution therapy.\nMETHODS: A retrospective review was performed of UA stone patients referred for surgery but treated with dissolution therapy between July 2007 and July 2016. Patients were identified using ICD-9 codes. Patients were treated with potassium citrate alone or in combination with allopurinol. Serial imaging and urine pH were obtained at follow-up. Demographics, aggregate stone size, time to stone clearance, urine pH (office dip), and complications were recorded.\nRESULTS OBTAINED: Twenty-four patients (14 men and 10 women) were identified that started medical dissolution therapy for UA nephrolithiasis after initial referral for surgical management. Three patients (13%) did not tolerate the initiation of dissolution therapy and discontinued this treatment. Of the 21 patients that were maintained on dissolution therapy, 14 patients (67%) showed complete resolution of nephrolithiasis and 7 patients (33%) showed partial reduction. Patients with partial response had a mean reduction in stone burden of 68%.

        "Abstract":"Chronic kidney disease (CKD) has become a global public health issue and uric acid (UA) remains a major risk factor of CKD. As the main organ for the elimination of UA, kidney owned a group of urate transporters in tubular epithelium. Kidney disease hampered the UA excretion, and the accumulation of serum UA in return harmed the renal function. Commercially, there are three kinds of agents targeting at urate-lowering, xanthine oxidoreductase inhibitor which prevents the production of UA, uricosuric which increases the concentration of UA in urine thus decreasing serum UA level, and uricase which converts UA to allantoin resulting in the dramatic decrement of serum UA. Of note, in patients with CKD, administration of above-mentioned agents, alone or combined, needs special attention. New evidence is emerging for the efficacy of several urate-lowering drugs for the treatment of hyperuricemia in patients with CKD. Besides, loads of novel and promising drug candidates and phytochemicals are in the different phases of research and development. As of today, there is insufficient evidence to recommend the widespread use of UA-lowering therapy to prevent or slow down the progression of CKD.

        "Abstract":"['max', 'max', 'max', 'max', 'max']\nTwo clinical studies were performed in healthy volunteers to investigate food and antacid effects on lesinurad, a novel selective uric acid reabsorption inhibitor approved for treatment of hyperuricemia associated with gout in combination with xanthine oxidase inhibitors. Study 1 evaluated a high-fat, high-calorie meal or high doses of antacids (3000 mg calcium carbonate or 1600 mg magnesium hydroxide\/1600 mg aluminum hydroxide) on the pharmacokinetics (PK) and pharmacodynamics (PD) of 400 mg oral lesinurad. Study 2 evaluated low doses of antacids (1250 mg calcium carbonate or 800 mg magnesium hydroxide\/800 mg aluminum hydroxide) on the PK and PD of 400 mg lesinurad. Food did not alter the plasma AUC of lesinurad and only reduced its C by 18%. In the fasted conditions, high-dose calcium carbonate reduced the C and AUC of lesinurad by 54% and 38%, respectively, whereas high-dose magnesium hydroxide\/aluminum hydroxide reduced C and AUC by 36% and 31%, respectively. Food enhanced the maximum serum urate (sUA)-lowering effect of lesinurad by approximately 20% despite reducing the C of lesinurad. High-dose calcium carbonate decreased the urate-lowering effect approximately 20% in the first 6 hours, whereas high-dose magnesium hydroxide\/aluminum hydroxide reduced the effect by 26%. Low-dose calcium carbonate or magnesium hydroxide\/aluminum hydroxide in the presence of food did not significantly affect plasma lesinurad C and AUC or the sUA lowering and renal handling of uric acid. In summary, study results suggest food did not meaningfully alter lesinurad PK and PD. High doses of antacids reduced lesinurad AUC up to 40% and reduced the lesinurad uric acid-lowering effect.",

        "Published":null,
        "Abstract":"Lesch-Nyhan disease (LND) is a rare X-linked genetic disorder, with complete hypoxanthine-guanine phosphoribosyltransferase (HGPRT) deficiency, uric acid (UA), hypoxanthine and xanthine accumulation, and a devastating neurologic syndrome. UA excess, causing renal failure, is commonly decreased by xanthine oxidoreductase (XOR) inhibitors, such as allopurinol, yielding a xanthine and hypoxanthine increase. Xanthine accumulation may result in renal stones, while hypoxanthine excess seems involved in the neurological disorder. Inhibition of purine nucleoside phosphorylase (PNP) represents a different strategy for lowering urate. PNP catalyzes the cleavage of purine ribo- and d-ribo-nucleosides into ribose\/deoxyribose phosphate and free bases, starting catabolism to uric acid. Clinical trials demonstrated that PNP inhibitors, initially developed as anticancer drugs, lowered UA in some gouty patients, in association or not with allopurinol. The present study tested the reliability of an analogue of immucillin-G (C1a), a PNP inhibitor, as a therapy for urate, hypoxanthine, and xanthine excess in LND patients by blocking hypoxanthine production upstream. The therapeutic aim is to limit the administration of XOR inhibitors to LND patients by supplying the PNP inhibitor in low doses, avoiding d-nucleoside toxicity. We report studies conducted in primary cultures of skin fibroblasts from controls and LND patients grown in the presence of the PNP inhibitor. Cell viability, oxypurine release in culture medium, and endocellular nucleotide pattern have been monitored in different growth conditions (inhibitor concentration, time, added inosine). Our results demonstrate effective PNP inhibition by low inhibitor concentration, with reduced hypoxanthine release, and no appreciable toxicity in control or patient cells, suggesting a new therapeutic strategy for LND hyperuricemia.",

It is found that the fluorescence of the C-dots (best measured at excitation\/emission wavelengths of 365\/473 nm) is quenched by selective oxidation of surface PEI by periodate but recovers in the presence of uric acid (UA). It is assumed that this is due to the selective reduction of the nitrone groups to hydroxylamine groups by UA. The findings were used to design a fluorometric method for determination of UA that has a 2.3 nM detection limit. This is lower than that of reported fluorometric and enzymatic assays. The performance of the method has been validated by determination of UA in samples of human saliva. It is found that the results agree well with those obtained by a commercial UA assay.

The prevalence of the disease increases with age, and it is statistically more observed in men than in women.We present the case of a 62-year-old male patient diagnosed as having gout 20 years ago. He came to the clinic with a nasal hump and a mass growing in his nose for the last 3 years, presenting as a nasal obstruction and facial deformity. Although the patient was treated with allopurinol and nonsteroidal anti-inflammatory drugs, surgical treatment was deemed necessary, and the patient was taken to receive a surgical resection of the nasal mass. The follow-up histopathology observation revealed deposits of urate crystals surrounded by a granulomatous inflammation. This confirmed the diagnosis-gouty tophi in the nose. In the follow-up period after the surgery, the patient reported overall improved breathing and aesthetic results.Tophi can be found in atypical locations, which increases morbidities and deformities caused by the disease. We report on this peculiar case of tophaceus gout as it is-a rare manifestation of the disease with tophi located in the nasal region.",

        "Abstract":"We have investigated the contributing role of monosodium urate (MSU) to the pathological processes associated with the induction of diabetic retinopathy (DR). In human postmortem retinas and vitreous from donors with DR, we have found a significant increase in MSU levels that correlated with the presence of inflammatory markers and enhanced expression of xanthine oxidase. The same elevation in MSU levels was also detected in serum and vitreous of streptozotocin-induced diabetic rats (STZ-rats) analyzed at 8 weeks of hyperglycemia. Furthermore, treatments of STZ-rats with the hypouricemic drugs allopurinol (50 mg\/kg) and benzbromarone (10 mg\/kg) given every other day resulted in a significant decrease of retinal and plasma levels of inflammatory cytokines and adhesion factors, a marked reduction of hyperglycemia-induced retinal leukostasis, and restoration of retinal blood-barrier function. These results were associated with effects of the hypouricemic drugs on downregulating diabetes-induced levels of oxidative stress markers as well as expression of components of the NOD-like receptor family pyrin domain-containing protein 3 (NLRP3) inflammasome such as NLRP3, Toll-like receptor 4, and interleukin-1β. The outcomes of these studies support a contributing role of MSU in diabetes-induced retinal inflammation and suggest that asymptomatic hyperuricemia should be considered as a risk factor for DR induction and progression.",

        "Abstract":"BACKGROUND\/AIMS: A substantial portion of gout patients have normal serum urate levels during an acute attack but data on the clinical characteristics and risk of recurrence compared with hyperuricemic patients are limited.\nMETHODS: In this retrospective cohort study, clinical features of normouricemic and hyperuricemic patients were compared. Multivariate analysis was performed to determine whether normouricemic patients were less likely to have a recurrent attack.\nRESULTS: Among a total of 221 gout patients, 88 (39.8%) had normouricemia during an acute attack. Postsurgical gout (22.7% vs. 6.0%, p < 0.001), hemodialysis initiation (9.1% vs. 2.3%, p = 0.029) and inflammatory activity were higher in normouricemic patients than in hyperuricemic patients. The frequency of renal insufficiency was lower in normouricemic patients (25.0% vs. 53.4%, p < 0.001). However, the recurrence rate of gout attack was not different between the two groups (24.7% vs. 33.0%, p = 0.220). In multivariate analysis, female sex, history of urinary stone, presence of tophi, and use of thiazide were associated with increase of recurrent gout attack, but not with serum urate status during an acute attack (hazard ratio, 1.075; 95% confidence interval, 0.972 to 1.190; p = 0.159).\nCONCLUSION: Normouricemia during an acute gout attack was more frequently observed in postsurgical episodes, hemodialysis initiation and patients with preserved renal function. While higher inflammatory activity was observed in normouricemic patients, recurrent attack was not associated with serum urate levels during an acute attack. Thus, careful follow-up should be considered in gout patients regardless of serum urate levels during an acute attack.",

        "Abstract":"BACKGROUND: Gout is a common inflammatory arthritis associated with adverse clinical outcomes. Under treatment is common in the general population. The aim of this study was to determine the prevalence of gout and its treatment among patients with chronic kidney disease (CKD).\nMETHODS: We conducted a multi-centre cross sectional study of patients (n = 522) who attended specialist nephrology clinics in Ireland. Standardized data collection tool recorded clinical characteristics and medication use at clinic visits and kidney function was assessed with standardised creatinine measurements and Estimated Glomerular Filtration Rate (eGFR). The prevalence of gout and the corresponding use of urate lowering therapies (ULT) were determined. Multivariate logistic regression explored correlates of gout expressed as Odds Ratios (OR) and 95% Confidence Intervals (CI) adjusting for demographic and clinical characteristics.\nRESULTS: Overall prevalence of gout was 16.6% and increased significantly from 7.5% in Stage 1-2 CKD to 22.8% in stage 4-5 CKD, P< 0.005. Prevalence increased with age (P < 0.005) and was higher in men than women (19.1% versus 10.3% P< 0.005). Overall, 67.9% of gout patients with CKD were treated with ULT, and the percentage increased with advancing stage of CKD from 55.6% in Stage 1-2 to 77.4% in Stage 4-5, P<0.005. Multivariable modelling identified men (vs women), OR, 1.95 (0.95-4.03), serum albumin, OR 1.09 (1.02-1.16) per 1 g\/L lower, poorer kidney function, OR 1.11 (1.01-1.22) per 5 ml\/min\/1.73m2 lower, and rising parathyroid hormone levels, OR 1.38 (1.08-1.77) per 50 pg\/ml higher as disease correlates.\nCONCLUSIONS: Gout is common in CKD and increases with worsening kidney function in the Irish health system. Over two thirds of patients with gout were receiving ULT, increasing to 77% of patients with advanced CKD. Greater awareness of gout in CKD, its treatment and the effectiveness of treatment strategies should be vigorously monitored to improve patient outcomes.",

        "Abstract":"Objective To assess the rate of successfully achieving treatment goals among Japanese men with hyperuricemia\/gout and identify factors influencing the success rate. Methods This cross-sectional study, conducted from January to December 2012, examined the serum uric acid (SUA) levels and clinical characteristics of 2,103 men with hyperuricemia\/gout selected from an initial population of 136,770 individuals who participated in a workplace health checkup. The success rates (defined as SUA ≤6.0 mg\/dL) were calculated, and a multivariate analysis was used to identify factors associated with \"therapeutic failure\" to achieve target SUA levels. Results The rate of successfully achieving the target SUA level was 37.5%. The body mass index (BMI) was significantly associated with therapeutic failure [25.0≤ Category (C) 2<27.5, adjusted odds ratio (AOR) =1.35; 27.5≤C3<30.0, AOR=1.69; C4 ≥ 30.0, AOR=1.94; relative to C1<25.0].

Those with higher BMI\/WC measurements were significantly more likely to have higher SUA levels than those with lower such measurements. The ongoing intake of dyslipidemia medication was identified as a protective factor against therapeutic failure. Discussion Our findings suggest a possible association between obesity and therapeutic failure, underscoring the importance of maintaining lipid profiles as part of managing SUA levels. Better management of both obesity and dyslipidemia may prevent future cardiovascular disorders by ensuring healthier SUA levels.",

Controls (n = 59,530) were matched at a 1:2 ratio by age, sex, and region. Multivariate Cox proportional hazards regression were performed to examine the dose-dependent relationship between ULT and T2DM.\nRESULTS: The adjusted Hazard ratio (HR) for the association of T2DM with allopurinol or benzbromarone exposure was 1.17 (95% confidence interval (CI) 1.07-1.28) and1.09 (95% CI 1.03-1.15), respectively.

Rhein is a major bioactive metabolite of diacerein which has been approved for treating osteoarthritis with a good safety profile in humans. Gouty arthritis is an inflammatory disease characterized by urate crystal-induced NLRP3 inflammasome activation with up-regulated caspase-1 protease and IL-1  in macrophages. Inhibition of the NLRP3 inflammasome formation has been considered as a potential therapeutic avenue for treating or preventing many inflammatory diseases. This study aimed to evaluate the anti-inflammatory effects of rhein on gouty arthritis. Rhein within the physiological levels of humans showed no toxicity on the cell viability and differentiation, but significantly decreased the production of IL-1  , TNF-  and caspase-1 protease in urate crystal-activated macrophages. Compared to medium controls, rhein at the therapeutic concentration (2.5   g\/mL) effectively inhibited IL-1  production by 47% (  ). Rhein did not affect the mRNA levels of CASP1, NLRP3 and ASC, but suppressed the protein expression and enzyme activity of caspase-1. Immunofluorescence confocal microscopy further revealed that rhein suppressed the aggregation of ASC speck and inhibited the formation of NLRP3 inflammasome. Rhein of 5   g\/mL significantly decreased the ASC speck to 36% (  ), and reduced the NLRP3 aggregates to 37.5% (  ). Our data demonstrate that rhein possesses pharmacological activity to suppress caspase-1 protease activity and IL-1  production by interfering with the formation of NLRP3 multiprotein complex. These results suggest that rhein has therapeutic potential for treating NLRP3 inflammasome-mediated diseases such as gouty arthritis.",

        "Abstract":"In observational studies, high serum urate levels are associated with adverse outcomes, including mortality. However, the hypothesis that urate-lowering may improve nongout outcomes has not been confirmed by placebo-controlled clinical trials. On the contrary, 7 recent placebo-controlled trials of urate-lowering drugs with different mechanisms of action (uricosuric: lesinurad; xanthine oxidase inhibition: febuxostat; uricase: pegloticase) have observed higher mortality or trends to higher mortality in gout patients, with the largest decreases in serum urate. Because all urate-lowering mechanisms were implicated, this raises safety concerns about urate-lowering itself. Far from unexpected, the higher mortality associated with more intense urate-lowering is in line with the U-shaped association of urate with mortality in some observational studies. Urate accounts for most of the antioxidant capacity of plasma, and strategies to increase urate are undergoing clinical trials in neurological disease. Post hoc analysis of recent trials should explore whether the magnitude of urate-lowering is associated with adverse outcomes, and safety trials are needed before guidelines recommend lowering serum urate below certain thresholds.",

        "Abstract":"PURPOSE: Neutrophil-to-lymphocyte ratio (NLR) was widely studied as a prognostic marker in various medical and surgical specialties, but its significance in diabetic kidney disease is not yet established.\nMETHODS: The subjects comprised 199 men aged 73 ± 11 (mean ± standard deviation) years and 187 women aged 77 ± 10 years from a rural hospital. We examined the relationship between NLR calculated by analyzing differential leukocyte count in complete blood picture and renal function evaluated by estimated glomerular filtration rate (eGFR) using the Modification of Diet in Renal Disease Study Group equation and urinary albumin excretion (UAE).\nRESULTS: NLR was negatively related to eGFR and positively related to UAE. Multiple linear regression analysis using eGFR and UAE as an objective variables, adjusted for confounding factors as explanatory variables showed that NLR (β = - 0.101, p = 0.009) as well as age, body mass index, serum uric acid, and presence of uric acid lowing medication were significantly and independently associated with eGFR, and NLR (β = 0.113, p = 0.031) as well as prevalence of cardiovascular disease, systolic blood pressure, presence of antihypertensive medication, presence of antilipidemic medication, and eGFR were significantly and independently associated with UAE. The multivariate-adjusted odds ratios (95% confidence interval) of NLR for stage 3a (eGFR < 60 mL\/min\/1.73 m), stage 3b (eGFR < 45 mL\/min\/1.73 m), and microalbuminuria (UAE ≥ 30 mg\/g Cr) were 1.90 (1.02-3.56) and 2.99 (1.28-6.98), and 1.77 (1.04-3.01), respectively. Next, to examine the consistency of the observed association between NLR and eGFR, we performed subgroup analyses. There was a significant interaction (p = 0.006) only between the two groups regarding antihypertensive medication (absence: β = - 0.272, p < 0.001 and presence: β = - 0.029, p = 0.564).\nCONCLUSIONS: Our data suggested that NLR might be important as a potential factor for evaluating patients with a higher degree of albuminuria among diabetic outpatients.",

        "Abstract":"PURPOSE: This study aimed to compare the renoprotective effect between febuxostat and allopurinol in hyperuricemic patients with chronic kidney disease (CKD), about which limited data are available.\nMETHODS: 141 patients with stage 3 CKD and hyperuricemia were followed from June 2005 to April 2018. Thirty patients received febuxostat, 40 allopurinol and 71 conventional CKD management only (control group). We compared the mean serum uric acid levels, estimated glomerular filtration rate (eGFR) changes over time and renal survival time free from predefined renal disease progression among these 3 groups.\nRESULTS: Overall, mean age was 62.6 ± 13.3 years, baseline eGFR 42.1 ± 8.8 mL\/min\/1.73 m, and serum uric acid 8.6 ± 1.5 mg\/dL without intergroup difference. During the observation period (55.9 ± 31.8 months), febuxostat group, compared to both allopurinol and control group, had significantly lower mean serum uric acid levels (5.7 ± 1.0 vs. 7.1 ± 1.2 vs. 8.0 ± 0.8 mg\/dL, p < 0.001) and maintained significantly higher mean eGFR values consistently for 4 years. Febuxostat group had significantly longer renal survival time free from renal disease progression than allopurinol and control group (87.7 (95% CI 71.2-104.2) vs. 77.6 (95% CI 60.2-94.9) vs. 48.7 (95% CI 39.3-58.1) months, respectively, p < 0.001). Cox proportional hazard model analysis adjusting for potent confounders revealed that febuxostat, with control group as reference, significantly reduced the risk of renal disease progression by 74.3% (hazard ratio 0.257 (95% CI 0.072-0.912), p = 0.036), while allopurinol showed insignificant result.\nCONCLUSIONS: Febuxostat seems to reduce serum uric acid level and to retard renal disease progression more effectively than allopurinol in hyperuricemic patients with CKD.",

The demonstration of reduction of cardiovascular risk with appropriate gout treatment would argue for a causal role for gout in cardiovascular disease. We reviewed recent studies that address the relationship between gout and cardiovascular disease.\nRECENT FINDINGS: Studies are conflicting; some show that lowering serum uric acid levels leads to better cardiovascular outcomes, whereas others show no such benefit. Inconsistencies in study design may contribute to these variations in outcome. Additionally, different gout treatment strategies may affect cardiovascular outcomes differently.\nSUMMARY: Despite an abundance of data generated in the last 5 years, it remains unclear whether treating gout with urate-lowering therapy provides a cardiovascular benefit. Additionally, further studies are needed to clarify whether different urate-lowering drugs confer different cardiovascular risks or benefits. Nonurate-lowering agents used for gout or commonly used in gout patients, such as colchicine and statins, may also improve cardiovascular outcomes in this population.",

About 6190 patients with gout and major cardiovascular disease, randomly assigned to allopurinol or febuxostat, were prospectively followed up for a median of 32 months. No difference was noted in the occurrence of the primary end-point event, a composite of cardiovascular death, nonfatal myocardial infarction, nonfatal stroke, or unstable angina with urgent revascularization, but cardiovascular death was significantly more common in the febuxostat group (4.3%) as compared with the allopurinol group (3.2%) (P = 0.03).\nSUMMARY: Present guidelines on the management of gout should be revised in view of recent findings. Allopurinol could be recommended as the sole first-line urate-lowering drug (ULD) in patients with no contraindication. In patients contraindicated to allopurinol, uricosurics could be preferred to febuxostat as first-line ULDs in patients with cardiovascular disease\/risk factors and no history of uric acid stones.",

        "Abstract":"BACKGROUND: Pegloticase is a recombinant mammalian uricase conjugated to polyethylene glycol approved in the United States for treatment of chronic refractory gout. It can profoundly decrease serum urate to < 1 mg\/dl. In patients receiving pegloticase who did not generate high-titer antidrug antibodies (responders), the serum urate remained low for the duration of therapy, 6 months in the phase III clinical trials plus the open-label extension. The objective of this study was to assess the velocity of tophus resolution in subjects treated with pegloticase.\nMETHODS: Data from two randomized controlled trials of pegloticase in chronic refractory gout were analyzed. Tophi were assessed by computer-assisted measurements of standardized digital photographs. Subjects were designated as responders and nonresponders based on maintenance of serum urate < 6 mg\/dl at months 3 and 6 of treatment. The projected time of complete resolution of all tophi was determined by linear regression analysis.\nRESULTS: The mean total tophus area at baseline was 585.8 mm for responders, 661.5 mm for nonresponders, and 674.4 mm for placebo-treated patients. Complete resolution at 6 months of at least one tophus was achieved by 69.6% of 23 responders, 27.9% of 43 nonresponders, and 14.3% of 21 patients who received placebo. Complete resolution of all photographed tophi was achieved by 34.8% of biochemical responders, 11.6% of nonresponders, and 0% of placebo-treated patients. The mean velocity of resolution of all tophi was 60.1 mm\/month in responders with a mean projected time of complete resolution of 9.9 months (4.6-32.6 months). There was a significant inverse correlation between serum urate AUC and tophus resolution velocity (r = - 0.40, P = 0.0002), although considerable heterogeneity in the velocity of resolution was noted. The only patient characteristic that correlated with the velocity of tophus resolution was the baseline tophus area.\nCONCLUSIONS: Pegloticase treatment caused a rapid resolution of tophi in responders that correlated with the serum urate lowering associated with this therapy.",

        "Abstract":"INTRODUCTION: Pegloticase is a PEGylated uric acid specific enzyme indicated for the treatment of refractory gout. Anti-pegloticase antibodies contribute to high discontinuation rates, increased risk of infusion reactions, and early loss of drug efficacy.\nOBJECTIVE: To describe the use of methotrexate to recapture function of pegloticase after development of anti-drug antibodies while treating gout.\nMETHODS: We report two cases of using methotrexate as an adjunct to treatment with pegloticase for refractory tophaceous gout. We also present the results of a literature review on the use of concomitant immunosuppressive therapy with pegloticase to prevent anti-pegloticase antibody development.\nRESULTS: Patient A, a 55-year-old man with a history of tophaceous gout, was treated with pegloticase but developed high serum urate(sUA) levels prior to his third infusion. Adjunctive treatment with methotrexate restored pegloticase response and the patient's sUA levels decreased, and remained low for the remainder of his treatment. Patient B, a 36-year-old man with a history of tophaceous gout, was treated with pegloticase. Oral methotrexate was initiated at the first infusion. Low sUA levels were achieved but increased after a lapse in methotrexate compliance. Re-initiation of methotrexate restored pegloticase response and the patient tolerated subsequent infusions. Literature review identified three reports of successful use of concomitant pegloticase and immunosuppressive therapy for refractory tophaceous gout, including an open label trial with a subset of 7 transplant recipients, an additional case study of pegloticase treatment with one transplant recipient, and a case study of pegloticase administered with low-dose azathioprine.\nCONCLUSION: Prophylactic use of immunosuppressive therapy with pegloticase may enable sustained treatment and improve outcomes. Additionally, immunosuppressive therapy seems to show the ability to recapture pegloticase response after development of anti-drug antibodies. The use of immunosuppressants to prevent anti-drug antibody formation, recapture pegloticase efficacy, and reduce discontinuation rates warrants further study.",

        "Abstract":"WHAT IS KNOWN AND OBJECTIVE: Febuxostat and allopurinol are xanthine oxidase inhibitors for urate-lowering therapy. The efficacy and safety of febuxostat and allopurinol have been mostly reported in hyperuricemia patients with normal renal function. Here, we aimed to compare the effects of these two drugs in early post-renal transplant recipients, focusing on evaluating the urate-lowering effect and recovery of allograft renal function.\nMETHODS: A retrospective cohort study was performed in early post-renal transplant recipients with new onset of hyperuricemia receiving febuxostat or allopurinol therapy. Serum uric acid (UA) and estimated glomerular filtration rate (eGFR) were detected on days 3, 7 and 15 and months 1, 3 and 6 after therapy initiation. Liver and blood functions were monitored and other adverse events were recorded.\nRESULTS AND DISCUSSION: A total of 48 and 33 patients were enrolled in the febuxostat and allopurinol groups, respectively. Significant UA-lowering effects were observed on day 3 in both groups. Febuxostat caused a more rapid UA decline, starting on day 3 and lasting for 1 month. The most apparent contrast was found in UA level (267.25 ± 93.66 vs 334.18 ± 96.56 μmol\/L, P = 0.003) on day 7; 62.5% and 30.3% of patients achieved target UA level in febuxostat and allopurinol groups respectively on day 3 (P = 0.004), but there was no significant difference between two groups from days 15 to months 6. The median times to achieve target UA level were 3 and 5 days in febuxostat and allopurinol groups respectively (P = 0.002). The eGFR levels and recovering rates were gradually upregulated but no significant differences were found between two groups. No abnormities related to febuxostat or allopurinol were observed.\nWHAT IS NEW AND CONCLUSION: This is the first comprehensive evaluation of UA-lowering effects of febuxostat and allopurinol in early post-renal transplant recipients. Febuxostat caused a marginally quicker serum UA-lowering effect than allopurinol, but there was no advantage for long-term use of febuxostat. The drugs had no significant differences in impacting renal allograft function recovery, and both were well tolerated.",

        "Abstract":"Among mammals, there is a positive correlation between serum uric acid (UA) levels and life span. Humans have high levels of UA because they lack a functional urate oxidase (UOX) enzyme that is present in shorter lived mammals. Here, we show that male and female mice with UOX haploinsufficiency exhibit an age-related elevation of UA levels, and that the life span of female but not male UOX+\/- mice is significantly increased compared to wild-type mice. Serum UA levels are elevated in response to treadmill exercise in UOX+\/- mice, but not wild-type mice, and the endurance of the UOX+\/- mice is significantly greater than wild-type mice. UOX+\/- mice exhibit elevated levels of brain-derived neurotrophic factor, reduced brain damage and improved functional outcome in a model of focal ischemic stroke. Levels of oxidative protein nitration and lipid peroxidation are reduced in muscle and brain tissues of UOX+\/- mice under conditions of metabolic and oxidative stress (running in the case of muscle and ischemia in the case of the brain), consistent with prior evidence that UA can scavenge peroxynitrite and hydroxyl radical. Our findings reveal roles for UA in life span determination, endurance and adaptive responses to brain injury, and suggest novel approaches for protecting cells against injury and for optimizing physical performance.",

Therefore, an overview on the topic can help improve our understanding of the patient experience.\nRECENT FINDINGS: This article explores several aspects of the patient perspective including the impact of gout on a patient's life, patient knowledge and beliefs regarding gout and its treatments, patient-perceived barriers to optimal medication adherence in gout and patient's perception of their gout. This article also summarizes any evidence of the association of patient perceptions to patient outcomes in gout.\nSUMMARY: A recognition of patient perspectives in gout has the potential to positively impact clinical care for gout. Discussion of disease impact, misperceptions about benefits\/harms of urate-lowering therapy (ULT), and patient values\/preferences regarding pharmacological and nonpharmacological treatments can lead to a better shared decision-making and improved outcomes in gout. These findings emphasize the importance of inclusion of patient perspective not only in clinical care and quality improvement and research initiatives but also in the design and implementation of the research agenda in gout. Inclusion of patient-reported outcomes in clinical research is likely to improve its relevance to patients with gout.",

        "Abstract":"PURPOSE OF REVIEW: Many novel genetic associations in the field of hyperuricaemia and gout have been described recently. This review discusses advances in gout genetics and their potential clinical applications.\nRECENT FINDINGS: Genome-wide association studies have identified approximately 30 serum urate-associated loci, some of which represent targets for drug development in gout. Some genes implicated in initiating the inflammatory response to deposited crystals in gout flares have also been described. In addition, genetic studies have been used to understand the link between hyperuricaemia and other comorbidities, particularly cardiometabolic diseases. ABCG2 has been established as a key genetic determinant in the onset of gout, and plays a role in the progression and severity of disease. Recent pharmacogenetic studies have also demonstrated the association between ABCG2 and poor response to allopurinol, and the link between HLA-B58:01 genotype and adverse drug reactions to allopurinol.\nSUMMARY: Advances in gout genetics have provided important molecular insights into disease pathogenesis, better characterized the pharmacogenetics of allopurinol, and raised the possibility of using genetic testing to provide personalized treatment for patients. Prospective studies are now needed to clarify whether genetic testing in gout provides further benefit when added to established clinical management.",

        "Abstract":"A 52-year-old man was referred to our department with a 2-year history of polyarthritis. He was diagnosed as gout due to acute arthritis of bilateral feet dorsum 2 years ago,but he didn't receive any standard treatment. 1 year ago,there were more and more joints evolved during the gout attack, and many subcutaneous nodules occurred. When he presented to our clinic 1 month ago,the urate acid level was as high as 715 μmol\/L. Moreover, we could find bone erosion in the X rays of his hand and foot,as well as synovitis,double contour sign and tophus on the ultrasound examination. The diagnosis of gout was clearly and definitely. However, he had leukocytosis and thrombocytosis for 4 years in the past history, and the urate acid level was only 400 μmol\/L at that time. He also had well-controlled hypertension. The family history was unremarkable. Furthermore, we found megalosplenia on his physical examination. The bone marrow examination showed myelofibrosis and JAK2 V617F gene was positive. He was diagnosed as primary myelofibrosis and treated with interferon-α, together with urate acid-lowing therapy (febuxostat 60 mg once daily). Following-up for 1 year,the dosage of febuxostat decreased to 40 mg once daily, and the patient didn't have gout attack again, some of the tophus diminished, and the urate acid level ranged from 400 to 500 μmol\/L. Gout is a common disease in clinical practice,usually combined with metabolic syndrome,chronic renal failure and specific drugs using (diuretic and calcineurin inhibitors). However,it is relatively rare to see gout associated with myeloproliferative diseases, including polycythemia vera, primary thrombocythemia, primary myelofibrosis and chronic myelocytic leukemia. In these diseases, the turnover of nucleic acids is greatly augmented, and an excess of purine metabolites, including uric acid, is released. In the natural course of gout, the appearance of tophus from the first onset of arthritis usually takes several years. This patient only had one traditional risk factor, but his urate acid level was remarkably high and he developed tophus in a short term. After treatment of primary myelofibrosis, the symptom of gout partially alleviated. Careful physical examination and medical history taking lead to the diagnosis of secondary gout, which should be reminded in the daily practice.",

Here in, we describe a case of a middle aged Chinese woman having RA complicated with atypical gout on both the knee joints.\nPATIENT CONCERNS: A 44-year-old Chinese woman complained of swelling and tenderness of multiple joints since 10 months. She had a positive rheumatoid factor and high titers of anti-CCP antibody. She was diagnosed with RA, and commenced on methotrexate, leflunomide, and methylprednisolone. Her symptoms of pain and swelling over interphalangeal and wrists joints subsided except the knee joints. She was started with treat to target treatment (TTT) for RA and rest of her medications was adjusted accordingly. Surprisingly, her symptoms did not improve ever after the addition of a biologic agent, tumor necrosis factor (TNF)-α receptor antagonist.\nDIAGNOSIS: Presence of urate crystals in the synovium was viewed under polarization microscope which was extracted from one of the knee joint. Hence, we established the diagnosis of RA complicated with gout.\nINTERVENTIONS: We commenced her on TNF-α receptor antagonist, colchicines, and febuxostat.\nOUTCOMES: Her symptoms of pain and swelling improved significantly on both the knees and no longer recurred.\nLESSONS: Coexistence of RA and gout has been rarely reported as it is not frequently seen in clinical practice. Hence, when patients with RA with oligoarthritis repeatedly do not respond to TTT, a standard antirheumatism treatment, the possibility of RA complicating with gout should be rule out.",

        "Abstract":"PURPOSE: The purpose of this study was to test a pharmacist-led intervention to improve gout treatment adherence and outcomes.\nMETHODS: We conducted a site-randomized trial (n=1463 patients) comparing a 1-year, pharmacist-led intervention to usual care in patients with gout initiating allopurinol. The intervention was delivered primarily through automated telephone technology. Co-primary outcomes were the proportion of patients adherent (proportion of days covered ≥0.8) and achieving a serum urate <6.0 mg\/dl at 1 year. Outcomes were reassessed at year 2.\nRESULTS: Patients who underwent intervention were more likely than patients of usual care to be adherent (50% vs 37%; odds ratio [OR] 1.68; 95% confidence interval [CI] 1.30, 2.17) and reach serum urate goal (30% vs 15%; OR 2.37; 95% CI 1.83, 3.05). In the second year (1 year after the intervention ended), differences were attenuated, remaining significant for urate goal but not for adherence. The intervention was associated with a 6%-16% lower gout flare rate during year 2, but the differences did not reach statistical significance.\nCONCLUSIONS: A pharmacist-led intervention incorporating automated telephone technology improved adherence and serum urate goal in patients with gout initiating allopurinol. Although this light-touch, low-tech intervention was efficacious, additional efforts are needed to enhance patient engagement in gout management and ultimately to improve outcomes.",

        "Abstract":"BACKGROUND: Dual urate-lowering therapy (ULT) with lesinurad in combination with either allopurinol or febuxostat is an option for patients with gout unsuccessfully treated on either monotherapy. Treatment failure is often a result of poor medication adherence. Imperfect adherence in clinical trials may lead to biased estimates of treatment effect and confound the results of cost-effectiveness analyses.\nOBJECTIVES: To estimate the impact of varying medication adherence on the cost effectiveness of lesinurad dual therapy and estimate the value-based price of lesinurad at which the incremental cost-effectiveness ratio is equal to £20,000 per quality-adjusted life-year (QALY).\nMETHODS: Treatment effect was simulated using published pharmacokinetic-pharmacodynamic models and scenarios representing adherence in clinical trials, routine practice, and perfect use. The subsequent cost and health impacts, over the lifetime of a patient cohort, were estimated using a bespoke pharmacoeconomic model.\nRESULTS: The base-case incremental cost-effectiveness ratios comparing lesinurad dual ULT with monotherapy ranged from £39,184 to £78,350\/QALY gained using allopurinol and £31,901 to £124,212\/QALY gained using febuxostat, depending on the assumed medication adherence. Results assuming perfect medication adherence imply a per-quarter value-based price of lesinurad of £45.14 when used in dual ULT compared with allopurinol alone and £57.75 compared with febuxostat alone, falling to £25.41 and £3.49, respectively, in simulations of worsening medication adherence.\nCONCLUSIONS: The estimated value-based prices of lesinurad only exceeded that which has been proposed in the United Kingdom when assuming both perfect drug adherence and the eradication of gout flares in sustained treatment responders.",

        "Abstract":"Laminaria japonica\nThis work aims to explore the amelioration of fucoidan on adenine-induced hyperuricemia and hepatorental damage. Adenine-induced hyperuricemic mice were administered with fucoidan, allopurinol and vehicle control respectively to compare the effects of the drugs. Serum uric acid, urea nitrogen, hepatorenal functions, activities of hepatic adenosine deaminase (ADA), xanthine oxidase (XOD), renal urate transporter 1 (URAT1) and NF-κB p65 were assessed. As the serum uric acid, urea nitrogen, creatinine, glutamic oxalacetic transaminase (GOT), glutamic pyruvic transaminase (GPT), superoxide dismutase (SOD), catalase (CAT) and malondialdehyde (MDA) data demonstrated, the adenine not only mediated hepatorenal function disorders, but also induced hyperuricemia in mice. Meanwhile, activities of hepatic ADA and XOD were markedly augmented by adenine, and the expression of URAT1 was promoted, which was conducive to the reabsorption of urate. However, exposure to fucoidan completely reversed those adenine-induced negative alternations in mice, and the activities of hepatic ADA and XOD were recovered to the normal level. It was obvious that hepatic and renal functions were protected by fucoidan treatment. The expression of URAT1 was returned to normal, resulting in an increase of renal urate excretion and consequent healing of adenine-induced hyperuricemia in mice. Expression and activation of NF-κB p65 was promoted in kidneys of adenine treated mice, but suppressed in kidneys of mice exposed to fucoidan from  or allopurinol. In conclusion, the fucoidan is a potential therapeutic agent for the treatment of hyperuricemia through dual regulatory roles on inhibition of hepatic metabolism and promotion of renal excretion of urate.",

The clinical relevance of this treatment in preventing gout attacks is unclear.\nPRIMARY RESEARCH QUESTION: What is the frequency of self-reported gout attacks and what is the effect of allopurinol use in patients diagnosed with gout in general practice?\nMETHODS AND ANALYSIS: Adult patients with a diagnostic consultation code for gout in the year 2013, 2014 or 2015 will be invited to participate in this prospective observational cohort study. Patients with a limited life expectancy will be excluded. Baseline measurements will include blood pressure, body mass index and a blood sample (estimated glomerular filtration rate, serum uric acid, cholesterol (low-density lipoprotein (LDL) and high-density lipoprotein), glucose (fasting)). At the 2-year follow-up, patients will receive questionnaires every 3 months. The questionnaires at baseline, 12 months and 24 months assess the frequency of gout attacks, the presence of tophi, comorbidity, medication use, quality of life, diet and lifestyle. The questionnaires in between only assess the frequency of gout attacks and medication use for gout. Descriptive statistics will be used to calculate the mean frequency of self-reported gout attacks during the 2-year follow-up. The propensity score for each patient being offered allopurinol is estimated and used to match patients with and without allopurinol treatment. We will compare the frequency of gout attacks in these groups using multilevel Poisson regression analyses. With this type of analysis, we can calculate the corrected estimated effect of allopurinol on gout attack frequency.\nETHICS AND DISSEMINATION: The research protocol was approved by the Medical Ethical Committee of the Erasmus Medical Centre in Rotterdam.

        "Abstract":"OBJECTIVE: Allopurinol dosing has frequently been limited based on creatinine clearance (CrCL), resulting in failure to achieve target serum urate (SU). The aim of this analysis was to determine how many milligrams of allopurinol above the recommended CrCL-based dose (R+) are required to achieve target SU and to investigate the factors that influence R+.\nMETHODS: We analysed data from participants in a 24-month open, randomized, controlled, parallel-group, comparative clinical trial. Data obtained during the 12-month dose escalation (DE) phase of the study (year 1 for DE\/DE and year 2 for control\/DE) were combined. R+ dose was defined as the number of milligrams of allopurinol above the CrCL-based dose at the final visit.\nRESULTS: Of the 132 participants, R+ allopurinol dose at the final visit was ≤ 100 mg\/day in 38 (28.8%), 101-200 mg\/day in 46 (34.8%) and > 200 mg\/day in 48 participants (37.1%). There was no significant difference between the R+ groups in the number of participants achieving target SU. There was an increase in plasma oxypurinol and a larger percentage and absolute change in SU as R+ increased. Multivariate analysis revealed CrCL, weight, baseline SU and allopurinol dose, were significantly positively associated with allopurinol dose at 12 months. There were no significant differences across R+ groups in renal or liver function adverse events, although there were numerically more serious adverse events in the higher R+ groups.\nCONCLUSION: A wide range of R+ doses are required to achieve target SU. Four easily obtained clinical variables (baseline SU, CrCL, weight, and allopurinol dose) may be helpful to predict allopurinol dose.\nTRIAL REGISTRATION: ANZCTR, ACTRN12611000845932 .

The objective of this investigation was to evaluate the stereoselectivity of metabolism, the inhibitory potency on kidney uric acid reabsorption transporters (URAT1 and OAT4), and the clinical pharmacokinetics of the lesinurad atropisomers. Incubations with human liver microsomes (HLM), recombinant CYP2C9, and recombinant CYP3A4 were carried out to characterize the stereoselective formation of three metabolites: M3 (hydroxylation), M4 (a dihydrodiol metabolite), and M6 (S-dealkylation). The formation of M3 in HLM with atropisomer 1 was approximately twice as much as that with atropisomer 2, whereas formation of M4 with atropisomer 1 was 8- to 12-fold greater than that with atropisomer 2. There were no significant differences in the plasma protein binding among lesinurad and the atropisomers. Following oral administration of 400 mg lesinurad once daily for 14 days to healthy human volunteers, the systemic exposure (  at steady state and area under the concentration-time curve from time zero to the time of dosing interval) of atropisomer 1 was approximately 30% lower than that of atropisomer 2, whereas renal clearance was similar. In vitro cell-based assays using HEK293 stable cells expressing URAT1 and OAT4 demonstrated that atropisomer 2 was approximately 4-fold more potent against URAT1 than atropisomer 1 and equally active against OAT4. In conclusion, lesinurad atropisomers showed stereoselectivity in clinical pharmacokinetics, metabolism, and inhibitory potency against URAT1.",

There are limited data on the use of urate-lowering therapy in people receiving dialysis.\nAIM: To estimate the point prevalence of gout, gout treatment and achievement of target serum urate (SU) among adults treated with long-term dialysis.\nMETHODS: Three secular cohorts of adults receiving dialysis for at least 90 days on 1 February 2017, 1 January 2016 and 1 January 2015 were identified. Medical records were reviewed for SU concentrations. Results were compared between haemodialysis (HD) and peritoneal dialysis (PD), and participants prescribed and not prescribed urate-lowering therapy. The percentage reduction in SU 24- and 48-h post-HD was estimated based on data from a previous study. SU concentrations were then used to estimate the percentage time the SU was <0.36 mmol\/L using linear interpolation.\nRESULTS: Of 216 dialysis patients, 61 (point prevalence 28.2%, 95% confidence interval 22.35-34.8%) had a diagnosis of gout. The mean (SD) age among those with gout was 61 years (14.4), 46 (75.4%) were men and 18 (31.1%) identified as Māori or Pacific Island. Forty-two (68.9%) were prescribed allopurinol (mean (SD) dose 116.0 ± 66.9 mg\/day). 46% had a predialysis SU ≤0.36 mmol\/L on less than 25% of occasions and 23% were below target on 76-100% of occasions. SU was below target 41% of time, with no statistically significant difference in those on HD or PD (P = 0.39), and those prescribed or not prescribed allopurinol (P = 0.55).\nCONCLUSIONS: Gout is experienced by approximately one in four adults treated with dialysis and two-thirds are prescribed allopurinol. A minority have SU at a target sufficient to prevent gout despite allopurinol and HD. A treat to target SU should be considered in those with SU above target.",

Between UOx gKO, cKO, or Tg mice and their respective wildtype littermates there were no significant differences in systolic or diastolic BP or in their responses to BP-regulating interventions.\nINTERPRETATION: Our complementary preclinical and human studies of urate modulation in animal models and in generally healthy early PD do not support a hypertensive effect of urate elevation or an association between urate and BP.

        "Abstract":"The study aimed to investigate the mechanism of the effect of Compound Tufuling Granules (CTG) to lower the serum uric acid level in a rat model of hyperuricemia. The rat model was established by administering hypoxanthine through oral gavage and potassium oxonate through intraperitoneal injection. Rats were divided into the normal group, model group, CTG group, and allopurinol group. Serum uric acid, creatinine, urea nitrogen, and inflammatory cytokine levels were determined in each group. In the model group, ultrahigh performance liquid chromatography-mass spectrometry was used to analyze the metabolic profiles and delineate the action mechanism of CTG; in addition, the orthogonal projection method was used to perform latent structure-discrimination analysis to screen the related metabolites. The results indicated significant differences in the metabolic profiles between the model and normal groups. A total of seven related metabolites were identified through screening in the model group, mainly related to the pathways of bile secretion, pyrimidine, purine, and phenylalanine metabolism, pantothenate and CoA biosynthesis, and pentose and glucuronate interconversions; these related pathways were reversed in the CTG group. In the metabolic networks, uracil and acetyl-coenzyme A were the nodal molecules. In addition, the test results of the evaluation of serum biochemical and inflammatory factors confirmed that CTG had significant effect in reducing the levels of serum uric acid and protecting renal function. These results confirmed that CTG primarily regulated the recruitment of nodal molecules to achieve anti-inflammatory effects, reduced uric acid level, and renal protection.",

        "Abstract":"OBJECTIVES: To explore patient perception of the role of a nurse-led complex package of care in facilitating engagement with urate-lowering therapies (ULTs) in the management of gout.\nMETHODS: Thirty people who had participated in a randomised controlled trial investigating the effect of a nurse-led complex package of care for gout, were purposively sampled and interviewed between 18-26 months after the end of the trial. Interviews were recorded, transcribed and analysed using a modified grounded-theory approach. Data were managed using Nvivo. STATA v15 was used to describe summary statistics.\nRESULTS: Participants described their views and experiences of engaging with a nurse-led intervention designed to provide holistic assessment, individualised patient education, and involvement in shared decision-making for the long-term management of gout. The analysis revealed key themes in how nurse-led intervention facilitated engagement with ULT, namely by proving improved knowledge and understanding of gout and its treatment, involvement of patients in decision-making about treatment, and increased confidence about benefits from treatment. However, some treatment uncertainty and concern remained and one participant free of gout flares discontinued ULT, while another halved the dose after the end of the trial.\nCONCLUSIONS: This study reports data on patient experience of engaging with ULT to manage gout after receiving nurse-led care. It demonstrates that shared decision-making and the joint efforts of fully informed practitioners and patients persuades patients to engage with ULTs, and that experiencing the benefits of curative treatment motivates them to maintain adherence.",

        "Abstract":"BACKGROUND: Heat stress and rhabdomyolysis are major risk factors for the occurrence of repeated acute kidney injury in workers exposed to heat and strenuous work. These episodes, in turn, may progress to chronic kidney disease.\nOBJECTIVE: The purpose of this study was to test the effect of allopurinol (AP) and sodium bicarbonate on the kidney injury induced by recurrent heat stress dehydration with concomitant repeated episodes of rhabdomyolysis.\nMETHODS: The model consisted of heat stress exposure (1 h, 37°C) plus rhabdomyolysis (R) induced by repetitive IM injections of glycerol (7.5 mL\/kg BW days) in the rat. In addition, to replicate the human situation, uricase was inhibited (oxonic acid [OA] 750 mg\/K\/d) to increase uric acid (UA) levels. Additional groups were treated either with AP 150 mg\/L, n = 10, bicarbonate (BC; 160 mM, n = 10), or both (AP + BC, n = 10) in drinking water. We also included 2 control groups consisting of normal controls (N-Ref, n = 5) and uricase-inhibited rats (OA, n = 5) that were not exposed to heat or muscle injury. Groups were studied for 35 days.\nRESULTS: Uricase-inhibited rats exposed to heat and rhabdomyolysis developed pathway and increased intrarenal oxidative stress and inflammasome activation. Kidney injury could be largely prevented by AP, and also BC, although the treatments were not synergistic.\nCONCLUSION: Increased levels of UA may play an important role in the renal alterations induced by heat stress and continuous episodes of rhabdomyolysis. Therefore, treatments aimed to reduce hyperuricemia may help to decrease the renal burden in these conditions. Clinical trials are suggested to test whether this is also true in humans.",

In addition to nonpharmacological therapy, hypouricosuric drugs reduce UA levels. The current study was a prospective observational study of six months duration November 2016 to April 2017 done to determine the efficacy of febuxostat in patients with hyperuricemia in chronic kidney disease (CKD) stage G3a to G5 and to correlate any association with reduction of hypertension, improvement in glomerular filtration rate (GFR), and reduction in comorbidities. The study was carried out at the Department of Nephrology, Owaisi Hospital and Research Center, Hyderabad. One hundred and ten patients were screened, of which 53 patients wherein stage G3a to G5 were recruited and SUA levels were obtained after inclusion criteria. SUA >6.0 in females and 7.0 in males were recruited. The drug febuxostat 40 mg was given once day to all patients with stage G3a to G5D with elevate uric acid levels >7.0 in males and more than 6.0 in females and three samples of UA were obtained monthly. The mean of GFR, blood pressure (BP), and SUA levels were obtained before and after the therapy. Of the 53 patients, males were 32 (60.3%), and females were 21 (39.6%). Mean age of the patients were 36.5 years. Mean UA levels before the start of febuxostat therapy were 8.6, and after adding febuxostat, it was 5.10 at the end of the third visit. The mean BP drop was 7.2 ± 2.1 mm in systolic BP (from 154-147 mm Hg) and diastolic BP drop was 93 ± 2.5 mm Hg (5.1 mm Hg). The mean GFR improved from 50.3 to 53.3 mL\/min after the start of febuxostat.

        "Abstract":"BACKGROUND: An association between gout and renal disease is well-recognised but few studies have examined whether gout is a risk factor for subsequent chronic kidney disease (CKD). Additionally, the impact of urate-lowering therapy (ULT) on development of CKD in gout is unclear. The objective of this study was to quantify the risk of CKD stage ≥ 3 in people with gout and the impact of ULT.\nMETHODS: This was a retrospective cohort study using data from the Clinical Practice Research Datalink (CPRD). Patients with incident gout were identified from general practice medical records between 1998 and 2016 and randomly matched 1:1 to patients without a diagnosis of gout based on age, gender, available follow-up time and practice. Primary outcome was development of CKD stage ≥ 3 based on estimated glomerular filtration rate (eGFR) or recorded diagnosis. Absolute rates (ARs) and adjusted hazard ratios (HRs) were calculated using Cox regression models. Risk of developing CKD was assessed among those prescribed ULT within 1 and 3 years of gout diagnosis.\nRESULTS: Patients with incident gout (n = 41,446) were matched to patients without gout. Development of CKD stage ≥ 3 was greater in the exposed group than in the unexposed group (AR 28.6 versus 15.8 per 10,000 person-years). Gout was associated with an increased risk of incident CKD (adjusted HR 1.78 95% CI 1.70 to 1.85). Those exposed to ULT had a greater risk of incident CKD, but following adjustment this was attenuated to non-significance in all analyses (except on 3-year analysis of women (adjusted HR 1.31 95% CI 1.09 to 1.59)).\nCONCLUSIONS: This study has demonstrated gout to be a risk factor for incident CKD stage ≥ 3. Further research examining the mechanisms by which gout may increase risk of CKD and whether optimal use of ULT can reduce the risk or progression of CKD in gout is suggested.",

        "Abstract":"OBJECTIVE: According to American clinical guidelines, allopurinol and febuxostat may be prescribed as first-line therapy to treat hyperuricemia. However, the Italian Medicines Agency directive, called Nota 91, allows the reimbursement of second-line febuxostat in the case of failure and\/or intolerance of a previous allopurinol therapy, so partially embracing European League Against Rheumatism recommendations and the British Society for Rheumatology Guideline. Such inconsistency might lead to heterogeneity among General Practitioners (GPs) in treatment of hyperuricemia. This study, therefore, aimed to evaluate the prescribing behavior of GPs in terms of compliance with Nota 91 and\/or official guidelines.\nMETHODS: Using the Health Search Database, a retrospective cohort study was conducted to evaluate the patterns of use of allopurinol and febuxostat between 2011 and 2016.\nRESULTS: In total, 44,257 and 5837 patients were prescribed with allopurinol and febuxostat, respectively. Among febuxostat users, 4321 (74%) had a previous allopurinol treatment; 92% of switches to febuxostat were related to hyperuricemia, whereas 9% of switchers presented intolerance to allopurinol; 26% of patients were prescribed with febuxostat as first-line therapy. The presence of diabetes and\/or moderate\/severe renal disease were statistically significant determinants of febuxostat use as first-line therapy.\nCONCLUSION: Prescriptions of febuxostat were highly compliant to Nota 91. Only a sub-group of frontline prescriptions of febuxostat were mainly driven by the presence of renal dysfunction, which is able to increase the risk of allopurinol intolerance and\/or inefficacy. These findings indicate that GPs' prescribing behavior for hyperuricemia is highly compliant with both regulatory directives and clinical guidelines.",

        "Abstract":"BACKGROUND: Chronic kidney disease (CKD)-mineral and bone disorder (MBD) is a systemic disorder that leads to vascular calcification and accelerated atherosclerosis. Uric acid has been shown to associate with vascular calcification and with carotid intima-media thickness (CIMT) and to suppress the 1 α-hydroxylase enzyme leading to lower 1,25-dihydroxyvitamin D (1,25(OH)2D) and higher intact parathyroid hormone (iPTH) levels. We hypothesized that lowering serum uric acid would reduce CIMT, calcification propensity, and circulating markers of CKD-MBD in CKD.\nMETHODS: This is a post-hoc analysis of a randomized, double-blind study of 80 patients with stage 3 CKD and hyperuricemia who received allopurinol or placebo for 12 weeks. CIMT and T50 were measured as markers of vascular disease and serum calcification propensity, respectively. The following markers of CKD-MBD were measured: serum calcium, phosphorus, vitamin D metabolites, iPTH, and fibroblast growth factor-23 (FGF-23). Expression of extra-renal 1α-hydroxylase was evaluated in endothelial cells of study participants.\nFINDINGS: Allopurinol successfully lowered serum uric acid levels compared to placebo with an estimate of -3.3 mg\/dL (95% C.I. -4.1,-2.5; p < 0.0001). After 12 weeks, however, we found no significant change in CIMT or serum T50. There was not a significant change in vitamin D metabolites, iPTH, FGF-23, or the expression of endothelial 1α-hydroxylase.\nCONCLUSION: These data suggest that factors other than uric acid may play a more important role in the regulation of CKD- MBD including vascular calcification and vitamin D metabolism in patients with CKD.",

Interleukin-1 inhibitors appear to be safe alternatives for treating cardiac patients who are contraindicated to conventional treatment. Presently, there is a paucity of evidence concerning whether treatment of hyperuricemia could lower the risk of CAD and this must be explored further.

        "Published":null,
        "Abstract":"BACKGROUND: In the UK, gout management is suboptimum, with only 40% of patients receiving urate-lowering therapy, usually without titration to achieve a target serum urate concentration. Nurses successfully manage many diseases in primary care. We compared nurse-led gout care to usual care led by general practitioners (GPs) for people in the community.\nMETHODS: Research nurses were trained in best practice management of gout, including providing individualised information and engaging patients in shared decision making. Adults who had experienced a gout flare in the previous 12 months were randomly assigned 1:1 to receive nurse-led care or continue with GP-led usual care. We assessed patients at baseline and after 1 and 2 years. The primary outcome was the percentage of participants who achieved serum urate concentrations less than 360 μmol\/L (6 mg\/dL) at 2 years. Secondary outcomes were flare frequency in year 2, presence of tophi, quality of life, and cost per quality-adjusted life-year (QALY) gained. Risk ratios (RRs) and 95% CIs were calculated based on intention to treat with multiple imputation. This study is registered with www.ClinicalTrials.gov, number NCT01477346.\nFINDINGS: 517 patients were enrolled, of whom 255 were assigned nurse-led care and 262 usual care. Nurse-led care was associated with high uptake of and adherence to urate-lowering therapy. More patients receiving nurse-led care had serum urate concentrations less than 360 μmol\/L at 2 years than those receiving usual care (95% vs 30%, RR 3·18, 95% CI 2·42-4·18, p<0·0001). At 2 years all secondary outcomes favoured the nurse-led group. The cost per QALY gained for the nurse-led intervention was £5066 at 2 years.\nINTERPRETATION: Nurse-led gout care is efficacious and cost-effective compared with usual care. Our findings illustrate the benefits of educating and engaging patients in gout management and reaffirm the importance of a treat-to-target urate-lowering treatment strategy to improve patient-centred outcomes.\nFUNDING: Arthritis Research UK.",

        "Abstract":"ETHNOPHARMACOLOGICAL RELEVANCE: Tejovati (Zanthoxylum armatum DC; Family- Rutaceae) popularly known as toothache tree is widely distributed in sub-tropical Himalaya region. Traditionally, The Southeast Asian population of Indo-Nepal origin uses it to treat asthma, gout, pain, and inflammation. The Ayurvedic action of the plant includes the balancing of Vata-Kapha in the body. Which lead to various ailments related to the circulation of blood and water, digestion, immunity, and skin. Therefore, in-vitro xanthine oxidase (XO) inhibition potential of the extract could be worth to explore prospect in the prevention\/treatment of gouty affections of the joints and other diseases.\nAIM OF STUDY: Anti-inflammatory and antioxidant potential of Z. armatum fruit (ZAF) has been reported. To date, no scientific study to validate the claim for gout treatment\/management has been attempted so far. The present study deals with the xanthine oxidase inhibitory potential of a various extract of ZAF and marker-based high-performance liquid chromatography (HPLC) standardization of most active fraction.\nMATERIALS AND METHODS: Liquid-liquid partioning of crude methanol extract of the ZAF followed by repeated column chromatography of most active fraction has resulted in the isolation of seven compounds. Five distinct groups of compounds were isolated, purified, and identified. We have investigated the therapeutic action of ZAF in the management of gout through in-vitro assay of XO, a key enzyme involved in gout pathogenesis.\nRESULTS: Phytochemical investigation of ZAF has resulted in the isolation of seven compounds of diverse nature. It is noteworthy to mention that out of seven, five compounds have shown the xanthine oxidase inhibitory action. The ethyl acetate fraction was most potent to inhibit XO. The XO inhibitory activity (IC values) of isolated marker chemical was ranging from 5.62 to 41.21 µM. Three compounds viz. acetyl phenyl acetate (ZA-2), prudomestin (ZA-6), and tambulin (ZA-7) showed the most potent XO inhibitory activity (IC ≈ 6 µM) comparable with a positive control (Allopurinol, IC, 3.38 µM). This is the first validated HPLC-PDA method for simultaneous analysis and accurate quantification of seven compounds (phenolic acid, acetyl phenyl acetate, xylopyranoside, diphenyl ether and three flavones) in ZAF as well as their distribution in other tissues of the plant.\nCONCLUSION: Most potent three chemicals (ZA-2, 6 and 7) could be considered as bioactive to ensure the robust quality of the enriched fraction of ZAF with defined XO inhibition potential. Therefore, either single purified component or their enriched fraction could be a better choice for the management of gout than the crude extract of ZAF. Developed HPLC method is suitable for quality assurance analysis and process control of ZAF derived product intended for gout management. XO inhibitory potential exhibited by the characterized compounds validate the traditional use of this ZAF for the treatment of gout. Further, a detailed study is required to assess the effect of ZAF chemicals on serum uric acid and mechanism of XO inhibition.",

        "Abstract":"['Objective:', 'Methods:', 'Results:', 'Conclusion:']\n['n', 'n', 'p']\nEvaluate efficacy\/safety of verinurad monotherapy in patients with gout (Japan\/US) or asymptomatic hyperuricemia (Japan). Two randomized, placebo-controlled, phase II studies were conducted (NCT01927198\/NCT02078219). Patients were randomized to once-daily doses of placebo or escalating doses of verinurad (study 1: 5-12.5 mg; study 2: 2.5-15 mg). Primary endpoint was percentage change from baseline in serum urate (sUA) at week 12 (study 1)\/week 16 (study 2). Safety was also assessed. Most patients in study 1 ( = 171) were white (74.9%); all patients were Japanese in study 2 ( = 204). Least squares means (±SE) estimate of percentage change in sUA levels from baseline in study 1 was 1.2 ± 2.9 for placebo, and -17.5 ± 2.8, -29.1 ± 2.8, -34.4 ± 2.9 for verinurad 5, 10, 12.5 mg, respectively. In study 2, results were -2.4 ± 2.5 and -31.7 ± 2.5, -51.7 ± 2.6,-55.8 ± 2.5, respectively. Difference from placebo was significant for each verinurad dose (<.0001). The proportion of patients with treatment-emergent adverse events (TEAEs) was similar across all groups. Renal-related TEAEs were more common with verinurad than placebo. Verinurad monotherapy resulted in sustained reductions in sUA in Japanese\/US patients but renal AEs occurred, so verinurad alone is not recommended for treatment of hyperuricemia or gout. The renal consequences of excessive uric acid excretion deserve study.",

        "Abstract":"The definition of asymptomatic hyperuricemia remains unclear, as no consensus exists about the serum urate cutoff or the relevance of ultrasound findings. Comorbidities associated with hyperuricemia have increased in frequency over the past two decades. Hyperuricemia (and\/or gout) may be a cause or a consequence of a comorbidity. Whereas epidemiological studies suggest that hyperuricemia may be linked to cardiovascular, metabolic, and renal comorbidities, Mendelian randomization studies have not provided proof that these links are causal. Discrepancies between findings from observational studies and clinical trials preclude the development of recommendations about the potential benefits of urate-lowering therapy (ULT) in individual patients with asymptomatic hyperuricemia. The risk\/benefit ratio of ULT is unclear. The risk of developing gout, estimated at 50%, must be weighed against the risk of cutaneous and cardiovascular side effects of xanthine oxidase inhibitors. The need for optimal comorbidity management, in contrast, is universally accepted. Medications for comorbidities that elevate urate levels should be discontinued and replaced with medications that have the opposite effect. Therapeutic lifestyle changes, weight loss as appropriate, and sufficient physical activity are useful for improving general health. Whether ULT has beneficial effects on comorbidities will be known only when well-powered interventional trials with relevant primary endpoints are available.",

        "Abstract":"BACKGROUND: In Traditional Chinese Medicine (TCM) theories, the typical clinical manifestations of gout are attributed to the \"dampness-heat pouring downward.\" Therefore, TCM practitioners always consider prescribing the formulae which are believed to clear heat and drain dampness for the management of gout. This clinical trial aims: (1) to determine the hypouricemic effect of \"Yellow-dragon Wonderful-seed Formula\" (YWF) decoction in gout patients with dampness-heat pouring downward pattern and (2) to determine if gypsum could provide additional significant benefits to YWF.\nMETHODS: A total of 72 hyperuricemic individuals with gout and dampness-heat pouring downward pattern were included with 62 of them completing the trial. Participants were randomly assigned to the YWF group, the YWF + gypsum group, or the allopurinol group. YWF and YWF + gypsum decoctions were orally administered for four weeks. Allopurinol was also orally administered for four weeks as the active control. Serum uric acid (sUA) level was the primary outcome measure. Urine urate level, scores on the SF-36 scale, erythrocyte sedimentation rate (ESR), X ray film, and C reactive protein (CRP) level were the secondary outcome measures.\nRESULTS: Compared with the values at week 0, YWF and YWF + gypsum did not significantly decrease the sUA level at each weekend reading. YWF, YWF + gypsum, and allopurinol decreased the urine urate levels and there were significant differences between the YWF group and the YWF + gypsum group. All the changes in the eight structures of SF-36 during the intervention period were not significantly different among the three groups and there was no significant difference in the CRP level among the three groups at each weekend reading.\nCONCLUSIONS: YWM, which modified on the basis of Two Wonderful Herbs Powder (2WHP), does not show significant hypouricemic effect. There is a possibility that Gypsum Fibrosum may provide additional effects to YWF in decreasing the urine urate levels but cannot add benefits to YWF in other outcome measures.\nTRIAL REGISTRATION: Chinese Clinical Trial Registry, ChiCTR-TRC-12001933 .

We enrolled 208 patients who were newly treated with febuxostat (n = 112) or allopurinol (n = 96) in this study. The efficacy of febuxostat was determined by the proportion of patients with serum uric acid (sUA) < 360 µmol\/L at the end of the study and changes of renal function.\nRESULTS: The target of sUA < 360 µmol\/L was reached by 96.4% of participants in the febuxostat group and 37.5% in the allopurinol group at 6 months. The eGFR in the febuxostat group showed an increase from 28.45 to 30.65 mL\/min\/1.73 m at 6 months, while in the allopurinol group, the eGFR decreased from 28.06 to 24.39 mL\/min\/1.73 m. Linear regression analysis showed that the reduction in sUA was significantly associated with an increase in eGFR and decrease in proteinuria. We found that 83.0% of the patients could remain with sUA < 360 µmol\/L at a maintenance dose of febuxostat 20 mg\/day.\nCONCLUSION: Febuxostat had superior urate-lowering efficacy to that of allopurinol in Chinese Han patients with hyperuricemia with CKD stages 3-5, and the reduction in sUA levels was associated with a slower progression of renal function.",

US evaluations were performed at baseline and at months 3 and 6 (M3, M6) after starting ULT. Outcomes were: the change in US features of gout at M6 according to final (M6) serum urate (SU) level (high, > 360 μmol\/l, i.e. > 6 mg\/dl; low, 300-360 μmol\/l, i.e. 5-6 mg\/dl; very low, < 300 μmol\/l, i.e. < 5 mg\/dl); and correlation between changed US features and final SU level.\nRESULTS: We included 79 gouty patients (mean ± s.d., age 61.8 (14) years, 91% males, disease duration 6.3 (6.1) years). Baseline SU level was 530 ± 97 µmol\/l (i.e. 8.9 mg\/dl ± 1.6mg\/dl). At least one US tophus and double contour sign was observed in 74 (94%) and 68 (86%) patients, respectively.

Presl bark (CB) extracts have been used as the main ingredients in several prescriptions to treat the hyperuricemia and gout in traditional medicine. In the present study, we investigated the antihyperuricemic effects of DKB114, a CF, and CB mixture, and the underlying mechanisms in vitro and in vivo. DKB114 markedly reduced serum uric acid levels in normal rats and rats with PO-induced hyperuricemia, while increasing renal uric acid excretion. Furthermore, it inhibited the activity of xanthine oxidase (XOD) in vitro and in the liver in addition to reducing hepatic uric acid production. DKB114 decreased cellular uric acid uptake in oocytes and HEK293 cells expressing human urate transporter (hURAT)1 and decreased the protein expression levels of urate transporters, URAT1, and glucose transporter, GLUT9, associated with the reabsorption of uric acid in the kidney. DKB114 exerts antihyperuricemic effects and uricosuric effects, which are accompanied, partially, by a reduction in the production of uric acid and promotion of uric acid excretion via the inhibition of XOD activity and reabsorption of uric acid. Therefore, it may have potential as a treatment for hyperuricemia and gout.",

        "Abstract":"OBJECTIVE: To evaluate the efficacy and safety of lesinurad for the treatment of hyperuricemia in patients with gout.\nDESIGN: Systematic review and meta-analysis of randomized controlled trials (RCTs).\nPATIENTS OR PARTICIPANTS: Five RCTs, which included 1959 patients, compared the efficacy and safety of lesinurad in patients with hyperuricemia associated with gout.\nMEASUREMENTS AND RESULTS: Relevant studies were identified from PubMed, EMBASE, Cochrane Library databases, and the ClinicalTrials.gov registry. Two reviewers independently assessed the studies. Individual effect sizes were standardized, and a meta-analysis was conducted to calculate the pooled effect size by using a random-effect model. The primary outcomes were the proportion of patients achieving target serum uric acid (sUA) levels by month 6 and the mean sUA levels at month 6 and month 12. Gout-related outcomes were also assessed. The secondary outcome was the number of treatment-emergent adverse events (TEAEs). Compared with xanthine oxidase inhibitor (XOI) monotherapy, lesinurad 200 mg or 400 mg in combination with allopurinol or febuxostat exhibited a higher proportion of patients achieving target sUA levels of < 6.0 mg\/dl or < 5.0 mg\/dl, respectively, by month 6. Lesinurad-plus-XOI groups also significantly sustained lower mean sUA levels at month 6 and month 12 compared to XOI alone group. In gout-related outcomes, no significant treatment group differences favored lesinurad. The number of TEAEs was comparable between the lesinurad 200 mg-plus-XOI group and the XOI-monotherapy group. Although lesinurad 400 mg monotherapy demonstrated superior efficacy compared with placebo, significantly more TEAEs occurred.\nCONCLUSIONS: Although the combination of lesinurad 200 mg and XOI is effective and well tolerated for treating patients with gout who have not achieved an adequate response to XOI monotherapy, clinical gout-related outcomes were not improved. Therefore, additional studies investigating the long-term clinical implication of lesinurad are warranted.",

This editorial summarizes new, emerging therapies for people with gout. Areas covered: We review several new therapies for gout, including those that are focused on lowering serum urate (levotofisopam, ulodesine, verinurad, merbarone, KUX-1151, UR-1102, FYU-981, SEL-212), or treating gout flares (canakinumab, bucillamine) or both (arhalofenate, diacerein). Expert opinion: Among therapies with both urate lowering and anti-inflammatory action, arhalofenate seems promising, but more data are needed. Examining therapies aimed at treating gout flares [anti-inflammatory action], bucillamine has some potential, but more data and Phase III studies are needed, to better understand its efficacy and safety. Among the urate-lowering therapies (ULTs), verinurad seems to be the most promising, while levotofisopam and ulodesine require more data. A uricase-replacement therapy with improved immune reaction (SLE-212) is in a Phase II trial. A number of ULTs including KUX-1151, UR-1102 and FYU-981 are in early development and more will be known once initial data and studies are published.",

Linear regression was used to establish the independent association of ADA with disease severity.\nRESULTS: The serum ADA activity, UA, and hs-CRP levels of the psoriatic patients were found to be significantly higher (<0.001). hs-CRP was positively correlated with ADA and UA in patients (<0.001). There was no significant difference in total cholesterol, low-density lipoprotein, and triacylglycerol in psoriasis patients, whereas we noted a decreased high-density lipoprotein level in psoriasis patients as compared to controls. Linear regression showed that ADA was independently associated with the disease severity and was statistically significant (<0.001).\nCONCLUSION: ADA activity was positively and significantly associated with the severity of psoriasis, therefore, it could be suggested as a marker for disease severity in psoriasis patients.",

Thirty six subjects were enrolled. The mean SUA level was reduced significantly from 6.51 ± 0.28 mg\/dl at baseline to 4.24 ± 0.38 mg\/dl and SUA of all subjects decreased by 34.8% compared with baseline. After 1-year treatment, the volume of tophus was reduced approximately 62.8%. Serum creatinine decreased stepwise in 8 gout patients with chronic kidney diseases from 162.5 ± 9.2 μmol\/l to 131.4 ± 11.0 μmol\/l. Two months after initiation of treatment, the number of gout flares began to markedly decrease and almost did not occur after 1 year. After the 1-year treatment of febuxostat, the average SUA level declined significantly, and the renal function improved gradually. There was nearly complete abolition of gout flares by the end of the study. Tophi resolved markedly compared with baseline as assessed by DECT. Furthermore, only a few people experienced adverse events. Febuxostat has a notable effect for gout patients in the lower SUA level range.",

        "Abstract":"['2', '2', '2', '2', '2', '2', '2']\nFebuxostat is potent and well-tolerated in the management of chronic gout. However, its clinical efficacy and safety in the treatment of hyperuricemia in patients with chronic kidney disease (CKD) and in renal transplant recipients have remained to be fully determined. The MEDLINE, EMBASE and Cochrane Library databases were searched for relevant articles. Data were extracted and pooled results were estimated from the standard mean difference (SMD) with 95% confidence intervals (95% CIs). The quality of the studies included was assessed, and their publication bias was examined. Four prospective randomized controlled trials and two retrospective observational studies were included in the systematic review and meta-analysis. Febuxostat administration significantly reduced the serum uric acid concentration in patients with CKD and in renal transplant recipients when compared with allopurinol or placebo in the short-term (1 month: SMD, -2.24; 95% CI, -3.59 to -0.89; P-value of SMD=0.001; I, 92.4%; 3 months: SMD, -1.20; 95% CI, -2.04 to -0.36; P-value of SMD=0.005; I, 88.9%; 6 months: SMD, -1.49; 95% CI, -2.68 to -0.30; P-value of SMD=0.014; I, 92.9%). Furthermore, the increase in the estimated glomerular filtration rate in the febuxostat group was significantly higher than that in the control group (SMD, 0.30; 95% CI, 0.031 to 0.58; P-value of SMD=0.029; I, 0.0%). No significant difference in the changes in serum creatinine (Scr), low-density lipoprotein (LDL) and high-density lipoprotein (HDL) was identified between the two groups (Scr: SMD, -0.17; 95% CI, -0.97 to 0.63; P-value of SMD=0.67; I, 79.2%; LDL: SMD, -0.21; 95% CI, -0.49 to 0.07; P-value of SMD=0.13; I, 34.1%; HDL: SMD, -0.05; 95% CI, -0.70 to 0.61; P-value of SMD=0.89; I, 69.2%). In conclusion, febuxostat is a potent and well-tolerated agent for the short-term management of hyperuricemia in patients with CKD and in renal transplant recipients. However, these data should be interpreted with caution due to the varied design of the studies included in the present meta-analysis.",

It is unclear, however, whether this is the result of environmental effects, patient anthropometrics or insufficient dosing of medical therapy (allopurinol).\nMETHODS: We have collected data on multiple clinical and laboratory parameters of 114 CKD clinic patients attending the nephrology clinic of the University of Mississippi Medical Center with an estimated glomerular filtration rate <45 mL · min · 1.73 m. We assessed the correlates of UA levels and the allopurinol doses along with achieved serum UA and urine pH.\nRESULTS: The cohort consisted of middle-aged to elderly patients with a mean (± standard deviation) age of 62.1 (11.6) years; 45.6% were female, 68.4% were African American and 47.4% had a history of gout. The mean UA level was 7.7 (2.49) mg\/dL (range 3.1-16), allopurinol dose was 192 (99) mg\/day (range 50-450) and estimated glomerular filtration rate was 23.8 (11.3) mL · min · 1.73 m. While the overall serum bicarbonate level was 25 (3.2) mEq\/L, urine pH was <6 in 60.5% of the cohort. Significant univariate correlates of the administered doses of allopurinol were weight ( 0.317,  = 0.001), body mass index (BMI;  0.313,  = 0.001), and female sex (0.198;  = 0.035). Achieved UA levels correlated directly with BMI ( 0.201,  = 0.036) but inversely with the allopurinol dose ( -0.196;  = 0.036). During logistic regression analysis with stepwise selection, only weight (β 0.313,  = 0.001) and sex (β -0.190,  = 0.039) proved to be predictive of the allopurinol dose; as for the achieved UA level, only BMI (β 0.271,  = 0.006) and the allopurinol dose (β -0.258;  = 0.009) had a significant effect.\nCONCLUSIONS: In patients with advanced CKD, conventional dosing recommendations for allopurinol are unlikely to suffice in reaching target serum UA goals.

In the present study, we estimated the reference levels of serum urate for gout. A study has shown the association between serum urate and incidence of gout during 5-15 years of follow-up. We calculated the reference levels of serum urate for gout based on the previous published data by using the benchmark dose (BMD) method. The subjects were divided into six groups according to serum urate levels (6.0, 6.5, 7.5, 8.5, 9.5, and 10 mg\/dL). Gamma, LogLogistic, and LogProbit models were used in BMD calculation. If the benchmark response (BMR) was set at 5%, the 95% lower confidence bounds of BMD (BMDL) of serum urate for the total population were 8.09-8.14 mg\/dL during 5 years of follow-up, 7.27-7.30 mg\/dL during 10 years of follow-up, and 6.73-6.99 mg\/dL during 15 years of follow-up.

However, the oral bioavailability of [6]-shogaol has been severely limited because of its poor solubility. In this study, a significant quantity of high-purity [6]-shogaol (yield: 3.6%; purity: 98.65%) was extracted and encapsulated in solid lipid nanoparticles (SLNs) via high-pressure homogenization (encapsulation efficiency: 87.67%) to improve its solubility and oral bioavailability. The resulting [6]-shogaol-loaded solid lipid nanoparticles (SSLNs) were stable, homogeneous and well-dispersed. Its mean particle size and zeta potential were 73.56 ± 5.62 nm and -15.2 ± 1.3 mV, respectively. Importantly, the in vitro release profile and in vivo oral bioavailability of SSLNs were significantly improved compared with the free drug. Furthermore, the SSLNs could remarkably lower the uric acid level via inhibiting the activity of xanthine oxidase and reduce the production of interleukin-1β (IL-1β) and tumor necrosis factor (TNF-α) in the hyperuricemia\/gouty arthritis rat model, when compared to the free [6]-shogaol. Collectively, SLNs could serve as a promising drug delivery system to improve the oral bioavailability of [6]-shogaol for effective treatment of gouty arthritis.",

To adjust for treatment duration, treatment-emergent adverse events (TEAEs) were expressed as exposure-adjusted incidence rates (patients with events per 100 person-years).\nRESULTS: In the core studies, exposure-adjusted incidence rates for total and total renal-related TEAEs were comparable for XOI alone and LESU200+XOI but higher with LESU400+XOI. Exposure-adjusted incidence rates for serum creatinine (sCr) elevations ⩾1.5×baseline were 2.9, 7.3 and 18.7, respectively. Resolution (sCr ⩽1.2×baseline) occurred in 75-90% of all events, with 66-75% occurring without any study medication interruption.

Rasburicase, a recombinant urate oxidase, catabolizes uric acid. At our institution, we administer a single 6-mg dose of rasburicase to patients who are at risk for tumor lysis syndrome. We aimed to assess the efficacy of single 6-mg dose of rasburicase and explore risk factors associated with rasburicase failure.\nMETHODS: We report results in 92 adult patients who had a baseline uric acid greater than 7.5 mg\/dL and received a single 6-mg dose of rasburicase for the management of tumor lysis syndrome. Responders were defined as those whose uric acid was less than or equal to 7.5 mg\/dL within 24-36 h of rasburicase administration. The primary end point was response based on uric acid level. Secondary end points included response to rasburicase in association with lactate dehydrogenase, serum creatinine, calcium, phosphorus, blood pH, and oncologic diagnosis.\nRESULTS: Median age was 65 years and 70% were men. Most patients had leukemia (32%) or lymphoma (40%). Eighty-seven of 92 patients (95%), who received single 6-mg dose of rasburicase, achieved a uric acid less than 7.5 mg\/dL within 24-36h of dosing. Body mass index was similar between responders and non-responders: 28.6 kg\/m vs. 26.6 kg\/m, respectively, p = 0.6. Baseline lactate dehydrogenase levels were similar between the groups: 756 U\/L vs. 892 U\/L, respectively, p = 0.33. Blood pH values documented within 24 h of first dose of rasburicase were also similar between the two groups (n = 30; 7.33 vs. 7.34 respectively, p = 0.6). However, median baseline uric acid was lower in responders than non-responders: 12.3 mg\/dL vs. 17.3 mg\/dL, respectively, p = 0.012.

Mean (s.e.m.) SU was higher at the end of the 12-month DE in IR compared with both CR and PR groups; 7.6 (0.31) vs 5.01 (0.06) and 5.97 (0.17) mg\/dl respectively (P < 0.001). In univariate analysis, compete responders tended to be older, be receiving less allopurinol, have longer gout duration and were more likely to be New Zealand (NZ) European ethnicity, compared with IR+PR. Using multi-variate logistic regression analysis, only longer duration of gout and NZ European ethnicity remained significant independent predictors of CR. Baseline SU ⩾ 8 mg\/dl had a sensitivity of 69.2% and specificity of 85.1% in predicting IR. The odds ratio for an IR if baseline SU was ⩾8 mg\/dl was 11.7 (95% CI 3.3, 41.2).\nCONCLUSION: A minority of people with gout never reach target SU when allopurinol dose is increased in a treat-to-target manner. Approximately one-third of those with SU ⩾ 8mg\/dl despite allopurinol ⩾300mg\/d have an IR to DE.\nTRIAL REGISTRATION: Australian New Zealand Clinical Trails Registry, https:\/\/www.anzctr.org.au, ACTRN12611000845932.",

The aim of the study is to determine whether a urate-lowering agent febuxostat, an inhibitor of xanthine oxidase, may improve the clinical outcomes in chronic heart failure patients with hyperuricemia when compared to conventional treatment. This multicenter, prospective, randomized, open-label, blinded endpoint study with a follow-up period of 24 weeks will enroll 200 Japanese chronic heart failure patients with hyperuricemia. The eligibility criteria include a diagnosis of chronic heart failure (New York Heart Association functional class II-III with a history of hospitalization due to worsening of heart failure within the last 2 years), reduced left ventricular systolic function (left ventricular ejection fraction < 40%) and increased plasma natriuretic peptide [plasma B-type natriuretic peptide (BNP) ≥ 100 pg\/mL or N-terminal pro BNP (NT-proBNP) ≥ 400 pg\/mL], and hyperuricemia (serum uric acid >7.0 mg\/dL and ≤ 10 mg\/dL) at the screening visit. The primary outcome is the difference in the plasma BNP levels between the baseline and 24 weeks of treatment. The plasma BNP levels are measured in the central laboratory in a blinded manner.

This study aims to analyze the clinical and biochemical characteristics and treatment outcomes of TLS in children with leukemia\/lymphomas in a resource-limited setting.\nPROCEDURE: Children with intermediate risk (IRD) and high risk (HRD) for developing TLS were retrospectively studied at a tertiary cancer center in India.\nRESULTS: Over a three-year period, 224 children with acute leukemia\/lymphoma having IRD (21.8%, n = 49) and HRD (78.1%, n = 175) were identified. TLS developed in 53.6% (n = 120) cases, of which 75% (n = 90) had laboratory TLS alone. Thirteen children had clinical TLS (C-TLS) at presentation while 17 patients progressed to develop C-TLS. TLS developed in 51% (n = 25) and 54.5% (n = 95) of children with IRD and HRD, respectively. Rasburicase was used in 8.5% (n = 19) cases and five children required hemodialysis. Two children (0.8%) expired during the course of TLS management. Multivariate analysis identified the presence of hyperuricemia as the single significant risk factor for developing TLS. When children in whom a 25% change in biochemical values from the baseline that falls within the normal range were excluded, 21.4% (48\/224) cases were identified to have clinically relevant TLS (8% in IRD and 25% in HRD).\nCONCLUSION: With hydration, supportive care and judicious use of rasburicase, it is feasible to manage TLS efficiently in resource-limited settings. A modification of the TLS definition criteria would help to identify clinically relevant TLS.",

While the use of combination therapies has been investigated for many years, we reviewed data from the published studies to investigate the efficacy and safety of this approach.\nMETHODS: Relevant published papers were identified by keyword search on PubMed and categorized according to the types of combination therapies included. Study methods and results were summarized. Outcomes of combination therapy were compared with respective monotherapies, where possible.\nRESULTS: Efficacy was assessed by changes in serum urate (sUA), urinary uric acid, gout flare rates, and \/or tophi. Safety assessments, where reported, included adverse events and, for more recent studies, laboratory assessments. Early studies in the 1960s based on case reports or open-label designs and more recent, well-designed studies with large patient numbers provided consistent outcomes: that combination therapy with a uricosuric and a XOI provides substantially greater sUA lowering than achieved by either monotherapy. Greater sUA lowering translated to greater gout symptom control, including improved tophus resolution.\nCONCLUSIONS: Combination therapy with a uricosuric and an XOI offers additional sUA lowering compared to monotherapy alone and can provide benefit for achieving therapeutic targets in patients with gout who do not achieve target sUA or are intolerant of XOIs at appropriate monotherapy dosing.",

Patients (n = 1,790) with a history of gout and normal or impaired (mild-to-severe) renal function were randomized to receive placebo, febuxostat IR 40 or 80 mg, or febuxostat XR 40 or 80 mg once daily (1:1:1:1:1 ratio). End points included proportions of patients with a serum urate (UA) level of <5.0 mg\/dl at month 3 (primary end point), a serum UA level of <6.0 mg\/dl at month 3, and ≥1 gout flare requiring treatment over 3 months (secondary end points).\nRESULTS: Both febuxostat formulations led to significantly greater proportions of patients achieving a serum UA level of <5.0 mg\/dl or <6.0 mg\/dl at month 3 (P < 0.001 for all comparisons versus placebo). Equivalent doses of febuxostat XR and IR had similar treatment effects on serum UA level end points; however, a significantly greater proportion of patients achieved a serum UA level of <5.0 mg\/dl with XR 40 mg versus IR 40 mg. Similar proportions of patients experienced ≥1 gout flare across treatment groups. Rates of treatment-emergent adverse events were low and evenly distributed between treatment arms. A preplanned subgroup analysis demonstrated that febuxostat formulations were well tolerated and generally effective on serum UA level end points (versus placebo) across all renal function subgroups.\nCONCLUSION: Both formulations of febuxostat (XR and IR) were well tolerated and effective in patients with gout and normal or impaired renal function, including patients with severe renal impairment.",

It is an oncologic emergency and occurs spontaneously after the initiation of chemotherapy for hematological malignancies. Therefore, the management of TLS is important. Rasburicase (RSB) has been shown to be effective for the management of TLS. We retrospectively investigated the optimal administration period of RSB (1 to 7 days) for 38 adult patients with a hematological malignancy who were at high risk for TLS. In all patients, the serum uric acid (sUA) value did not increase beyond the upper limit of normal. Clinical TLS did not occur in any patients. Seven patients were administered a single-dose of RSB and sUA remained within normal limits. These results suggested that single-dose RSB administration was efficacious for Japanese adult patients with hematological malignancies who are at high risk for TLS.",

Areas covered: The authors summarize the pre-clinical studies and pivotal randomized controlled trials of febuxostat when used as a treatment for hyperuricaemia in gout Expert opinion: Febuxostat has clinical efficacy in serum urate lowering, and long-term use leads to improved outcomes such as gout flare frequency and tophus burden. Recently published post-approval placebo-controlled trials have demonstrated urate-lowering efficacy and safety of febuxostat in patients with chronic kidney disease, and reduced frequency of gout flares in people with early onset of gout. In November 2017, the FDA issued a drug safety communication based on the preliminary results of the CARES trial. This cardiovascular safety study of 6190 patients with gout and established cardiovascular disease comparing febuxostat and allopurinol showed no difference in the primary endpoint (a composite of cardiovascular death, nonfatal myocardial infarction, nonfatal stroke, or unstable angina with urgent revascularization), but did report higher all-cause mortality (hazard ratio 1.22) and cardiovascular mortality (hazard ratio 1.34) with febuxostat.

        "Abstract":"BACKGROUND: Lesch-Nyhan syndrome is a rare inborn error of purine metabolism marked by a complete deficiency of the enzyme hypoxanthine-guanine phosphoribosyltransferase (HPRT). Inherited as an X-linked recessive genetic disorder that primarily affects males, patients with Lesch-Nyhan syndrome exhibit severe neurological impairments, including choreoathetosis, ballismus, cognitive dysfunction, and self-injurious behavior. Uric acid levels are usually abnormally high, leading to kidney and bladder stones which often necessitate urological intervention. Factor V Leiden is an autosomal dominant disorder of blood clotting associated with hypercoagulability, thrombophilia, and renal disease.\nCASE PRESENTATION: We present the first reported case of xanthine calculi in a patient with Lesch-Nyhan syndrome and Factor V Leiden who was treated with allopurinol. A renal ultrasound and CT scan demonstrated bilateral staghorn calculi in the kidneys as well as nephrocalcinosis. Two years earlier the patient underwent cystoscopy with bilateral ureteroscopy and laser lithotripsy, and he was stone free afterwards. The patient subsequently underwent bilateral percutaneous nephrolithotomy (PCNL) and was stone free following the procedure. Patients with endogenous overproduction of uric acid who are being treated with allopurinol have a higher chance of developing xanthine stones.\nCONCLUSIONS: Pediatricians treating these children should be aware of these rare conditions and promptly manage the potential complications that may require medical or surgical intervention.",

        "Abstract":"BACKGROUND: Gout has an increasing global prevalence. Underutilization of urate-lowering therapy (ULT) is thought to be common, via both suboptimal dosing and poor medication adherence. The aims of this study were to determine the prevalence of self-reported gout and the key predictors of ULT use in those with gout in a representative population survey in South Australia.\nMETHODS: Data were obtained from the Spring 2015 South Australian Health Omnibus Survey, a multilevel, systematic, survey in a representative population sample involving face-to-face interviews (n = 3005). This study analyzed responses from respondents aged ≥ 25 years (n = 2531) about self-reported gout, ULT use, sociodemographic factors, lifestyle factors, and comorbidities, using survey weighting. Univariate and subsequent adjusted logistic regression analyses on self-reported gout were performed. ULT use was divided into three categories (never use, prior use, and current use) and these data were analyzed using a multinomial logistic regression model.\nRESULTS: Self-reported gout prevalence was 6.8% (95% CI 5.8, 7.9). The mean age of respondents with gout was 64 years (standard deviation 16) and 82% were male. As expected, older age, male gender, lower socioeconomic status (SES), and higher body mass index (BMI) were associated with gout, as were high alcohol consumption, current smoking, other forms of arthritis, and hypertension or hypercholesterolemia medication, after adjustment for sociodemographic variables. Two thirds of respondents with gout reported ULT use (36% current; 29% previous) with only 55% continuing treatment. Predictors of ULT use included male gender, low SES, and concomitant cholesterol-lowering therapy. Respondents with gout with a higher BMI were more likely to remain on ULT.\nCONCLUSIONS: Despite gout being a common, potentially disabling joint disease, only 55% of respondents with gout in this study adhered to ULT. Identification of key predictors of ULT use will provide guidance on prescribing strategy in clinical practice and on the quality of gout care in the community.",

In Australia, most patients with chronic tophaceous gout (CTG) are treated by general practitioners (GPs). Urate-lowering therapy, if adhered to continuously, can suppress the disease, reduce the likelihood of flares and prevent long-term complications such as disfiguring tophi and joint damage. Many rheumatology societies recommend a treat-to-target (T2T) approach, lowering serum urate to 0.35 mmol\/L or below with urate lowering therapy.\nOBJECTIVE: The aim of this article is to discuss inconsistencies in treatment guidelines, identify patient and physician barriers to optimal gout care, explain why a T2T approach is appropriate and make a series of recommendations that are practical for GPs.\nDISCUSSION: Despite an in-depth understanding of this controllable disease and the availability of simple, safe treatments, chronic gout remains poorly managed.

        "Abstract":"OBJECTIVE: Hyperuricemia has been epidemiologically associated with multiple comorbidities including chronic renal failure and cardiovascular disease. Cause and effect are difficult to address, given comorbidities associated with and prevalence of metabolic syndrome. One impediment to achieving serum uric acid (sUa) levels less than or equal to 6.0 mg\/DL is the concept that allopurinol might be nephrotoxic. We examined the relation of sUa less than or equal to 6.0 mg\/dL to renal function over time.\nMETHODS: This is a medical records review study of 348 hyperuricemia patients identified in 2015, as having been followed with serial uric acid measurements. After 1 year of serial urate levels, to allow for treatment, patient cohorts were defined: sUa less than or equal to 6.0 mg\/dL and sUa greater than 6.0 mg\/dL. A repeated measure model was used to test for an association between uric acid level and serum creatinine, while adjusting for covariates.\nRESULTS: There was a significant difference in the least square means of serum creatinine comparing those who achieved an sUa less than or equal to 6.0 mg\/dL versus sUa greater than 6.0 mg\/dL (1.39 mg\/dL [95% confidence interval, 1.30-1.48] vs 1.57 mg\/dL [95% confidence interval, 1.46-1.69]; p = 0.0015). This is a between-group difference in creatinine of 0.18 mg\/dL. If a change in serum creatinine of 0.2 is considered significant, this short-term between-group progression of renal failure approaches clinical significance.\nCONCLUSIONS: Given that most serial measures were within the first few years of follow-up, and change in renal function occurs slowly over time, the between group difference of sUa of 0.18 mg\/dL is close to a clinically significant creatinine difference of 0.2 mg\/dL.",

Time to  () was ~1.25-2.0 hours with fasting. A moderate-fat meal delayed  (range 3.0-5.0 hours) and had a variable effect on AUC (0%-97% increase) and  (0%-26% increase) across the dose groups. Following multiple verinurad 10 mg doses,  and AUC were 38% and 23% higher, respectively, in Japanese vs non-Asian subjects, largely due to body weight differences. Mean reduction of serum urate following multiple verinurad 10 mg doses was 46% and 44% after 24 hours in Japanese and non-Asian subjects, respectively. Verinurad was well tolerated at all doses.\nCONCLUSION: Verinurad monotherapy lowered serum urate and was well tolerated in both healthy Japanese and non-Asian males, while small differences in plasma pharmacokinetics were observed. These data support further evaluation of once-daily verinurad as a treatment for gout and asymptomatic hyperuricemia.",

        "Abstract":"UNLABELLED: BACKGROUND AND OBJECTIVE: Verinurad (RDEA3170) is a high-affinity, selective URAT1 transporter inhibitor in development for treating gout and asymptomatic hyperuricemia. This Phase I, single-dose study investigated the pharmacokinetics, pharmacodynamics, and safety of verinurad in adults with renal impairment and controls with normal renal function.\nMETHODS: Males aged 18-85 years were enrolled with serum urate (sUA) 4.5-10 mg\/dl and creatinine clearance 60- < 90, 30- < 60, 15- < 30, or ≥ 90 ml\/min (mild, moderate, severe renal impairment and controls, respectively; n = 7\/8). Verinurad 15 mg was administered orally under fasted conditions. Serial plasma\/serum and urine samplings were 30 min pre-dose to 72 h post-dose.\nRESULTS: Compared to controls, verinurad maximum observed plasma concentration increased by 53, 73, and 128% and area under the concentration-time curve increased by 24, 148, and 130%, in subjects with mild, moderate, and severe renal impairment, respectively; renal clearance decreased by 5, 42, and 79%. Exposures of major verinurad metabolites also increased with increasing renal impairment. Verinurad decreased sUA in all groups, with greater maximal changes in control and mild renal impairment than moderate and severe impairment groups (- 38.3, - 36.9, - 20.5, - 12.6%, respectively). There were no adverse event-related withdrawals or clinically meaningful changes in laboratory values.\nCONCLUSION: Exposures of verinurad and metabolites increased with decreasing renal function. Consistent with the renal-dependent mechanism of action of verinurad, increasing severity of renal impairment was associated with decreased sUA lowering. Verinurad safety assessments were similar regardless of renal impairment. Continued investigation of verinurad is warranted in patients with gout and renal impairment.

        "Abstract":"Gout is a systemic disease, characterized by the formation and deposition of crystals in tissues (mainly in and around the joints) of individuals with elevated serum uric acid levels. Lately, a considerable number of reports relating elevated uric acid and\/or gout with rhythm disorders, such as atrial fibrillation, have been published. This review summarizes evidence linking common arrhythmias and hyperuricemia\/gout and discusses questions or controversies that surround it. Overall, existing evidence may not be overwhelming, but strongly suggests a positive correlation between uric acid levels and common rhythm disorders. Needless to say that such a link - as a univariate association between the two - is to be expected, given the extensive overlap of risk factors and comorbidities of hyperuricemia\/gout and arrhythmias. However, the observed associations seem to persist - in most studies - after extensive adjustment for potential confounders. Still, multivariable analyses of epidemiologically collected data cannot substitute for proof coming from basic and clinical studies. There is obviously a need for further basic research to establish a causal relationship between uric acid effects and arrhythmias, as well as translational studies and clinical trials to investigate the therapeutic implications of such a relationship. Simply put, we are fairly certain that there is association, but proof of causation is what we are still in want of.",

Achieving and maintaining serum urate below 0.36 mmol\/L is considered an effective response to ULT. On an intention to treat basis, clinical trials indicate that allopurinol at daily doses of 100 to 300 mg decreases serum urate adequately in only about 40% of gout patients while febuxostat 80 mg daily reduces serum urate adequately in approximately 70% of gout patients. Higher doses of ULT may be required in patients receiving concomitant diuretics. The addition of a uricosuric agent to allopurinol and febuxostat therapy significantly increases the proportion of patients achieving adequate lowering of serum urate. Finally, carriers of a genetic variant of the transporter, ABCG2 (BCRP), have a decreased response to allopurinol. Careful examination of medication adherence, titration of doses, and the addition of uricosuric agents increase the percentage of patients responding to allopurinol and febuxostat.",

The results showed that the degradation efficiency of various MXs varied with the number and position of the methyl groups on the molecule (, xanthine > 7-methylxanthine ≈ theobromine > caffeine > theophylline > 1-methylxanthine). Multiple MX catabolism pathways coexisted in strain CT25, and a different pathway would be triggered by various MXs. Demethylation dominated in the degradation of N-7-methylated MXs (such as 7-methylxanthine, theobromine, and caffeine), where C-8 oxidation was the major pathway in the catabolism of 1-methylxanthine, whereas demethylation and C-8 oxidation are likely both involved in the degradation of theophylline. Enzymes responsible for MX degradation were located inside the cell. Both cell culture and cell-free enzyme assays revealed that N-1 demethylation might be a rate-limiting step for the catabolism of the MXs. Surprisingly, accumulation of uric acid was observed in a cell-free reaction system, which might be attributed to the lack of activity of uricase, a cytochrome -coupled membrane integral enzyme.",

It was further found that the underlying mechanism is related to the reduction in expression of NLRP3\/caspase-1\/IL-18\/IL-1beta and improved insulin resistance (IR). This finding highlights the possible molecular pathways involving NLRP3 activation for management of ROS and insulin IR.

However, it is controversial whether xanthine oxidase inhibition has benefits for patients with chronic heart failure. We designed the Effect of Xanthine Oxidase Inhibitor in Chronic Heart Failure Patients Complicated with Hyperuricemia study (Excited-UA study) to compare the beneficial effects between a novel xanthine oxidoreductase inhibitor, topiroxostat, and a conventional agent, allopurinol, in patients with chronic heart failure and hyperuricemia. We focus on serum N-terminal pro-brain natriuretic peptide (NT-proBNP) level, echocardiography-based cardiac function, vascular endothelial function, renal function, inflammation, and oxidative stress.\nMETHODS: The excited-UA is a prospective, randomized, open-label, blinded-endpoint clinical trial designed to prove our hypothesis that topiroxostat is more effective than allopurinol in patients with chronic heart failure and hyperuricemia. A total of 140 patients with chronic heart failure and hyperuricemia (plasma brain natriuretic peptide level ≥ 40 pg\/mL and serum uric acid level ≥ 7.0 mg\/dL) are randomly assigned (ratio 1:1) into either the topiroxostat group (40-160 mg\/day) or allopurinol group (100-300 mg\/day), to achieve the target uric acid level of 6.0 mg\/dL. According to the protocol, all patients are followed up annually for 24 weeks. The primary endpoint is percent change in serum NT-proBNP level at 24 weeks from baseline.\nCONCLUSIONS: The Excited-UA study would provide novel evidence for the clinical relevancy of xanthine oxidoreductase inhibitor treatment in patients with chronic heart failure and hyperuricemia.",

        "Abstract":"Xanthine oxidoreductase plays an important role in formation of uric acid and its regulation during purine catabolism. Uncontrolled expression of this enzyme is responsible for overproduction and deposition of uric acid in blood that is potentially injurious because it can breakdown DNA and protein molecules, triggering many diseases. Human Xanthine oxidoreductase (HsXOR) is considered to be a pharmacological target for the treatment of hyperuricemia. Many of the HsXOR-inhibitor drugs such as Febuxostat and Allopurinol are known to have significant adverse effects. Therefore, there is an urgent need to develop new HsXOR-inhibitor drugs with less or no toxicity for the long-term treatment or prevention of hyperuricemia-related diseases. Many nutritious and medical functions have been reported in millets. Present work deals with identification of millet derived compounds in terms of their interaction with target, HsXOR through molecular docking and dynamic simulation studies. Of thirty two chosen compounds, Luteolin and Quercitin showed more binding affinity with HsXOR than reference drugs, Febuxostat and Allopurinol. Molecular dynamics simulations (20 ns long) revealed that Luteolin-protein complex was energetically more stable than Quercitin-protein complex. The millet derived compounds i.e. Luteolin and Quercitin showed binding energy -9.7 kcal\/mol whereas the known drugs i.e. Febuxostat and Allopurinol showed binding energy -8.0 kcal\/mol and -5.5 kcal\/mol respectively. Based on the study, Luteolin possess high potential to be considered for trial as an inhibitor of HsXOR as it may regulate the pathway by inhibiting HsXOR. Further investigations are proposed to consider Luteolin for developing future drugs from millets and other natural sources.",

However, there has been a trend in practice due to recent data showing benefit using a fixed-dose approach. The purpose of this study was to evaluate the efficacy and safety between fixed and weight-based dosing of rasburicase in a pediatric population.\nPROCEDURE: This was a retrospective chart review of 48 patients from January 1, 2007 to August 31, 2016 at Children's National Health System. Patients less than 18 years old with a documented diagnosis of a malignancy and baseline uric acid level were included; patients less than 30 kg at the time of rasburicase administration were excluded.\nRESULTS: The primary endpoint of this study was the treatment success of normalization of uric acid level (<5 mg\/dl) within 24 hr of rasburicase administration. Eighty-three percent of patients had success with normalization of uric acid post rasburicase dose. Eighty-five percent of patients had success in the weight-based group compared to eighty-one percent in the fixed-dose group (P = 0.715). Mean percent reduction of uric acid at 24 hr was relatively similar between both groups (94% vs. 89%).\nCONCLUSION: Our results suggest that a fixed-dose strategy of rasburicase is both safe and effective in reducing uric acid levels in the pediatric patient population.

Xanthine oxidase inhibitors, allopurinol and febuxostat, are the mainstay of urate-lowering treatment for gout and may have different effects on cardiovascular risk in patients with gout.\nMETHODS: Using US Medicare claims data (2008-2013), we conducted a cohort study for comparative cardiovascular safety of initiating febuxostat versus allopurinol among patients with gout ≥65 years of age. The primary outcome was a composite end point of hospitalization for myocardial infarction or stroke. Secondary outcomes were individual end points of hospitalization for myocardial infarction, stroke, coronary revascularization, new and recurrent heart failure, and all-cause mortality. We used propensity score matching with a ratio of 1:3 to control for confounding. We estimated incidence rates and hazard ratios for primary and secondary outcomes in the propensity score-matched cohorts of febuxostat and allopurinol initiators.\nRESULTS: We included 24 936 febuxostat initiators propensity score-matched to 74 808 allopurinol initiators. The median age was 76 years, 52% were male, and 12% had cardiovascular disease at baseline. The incidence rate per 100 person-years for the primary outcome was 3.43 in febuxostat and 3.36 in allopurinol initiators. The hazard ratio for the primary outcome was 1.01 (95% CI, 0.94-1.08) in the febuxostat group compared with the allopurinol group. Risk of secondary outcomes including all-cause mortality was similar in both groups, except for a modestly decreased risk of heart failure exacerbation (hazard ratio, 0.94; 95% CI, 0.91-0.99) in febuxostat initiators. The hazard ratio for all-cause mortality associated with long-term use of febuxostat (>3 years) was 1.25 (95% CI, 0.56-2.80) versus allopurinol. Subgroup and sensitivity analyses consistently showed similar cardiovascular risk in both groups.\nCONCLUSIONS: Among a cohort of 99 744 older Medicare patients with gout, overall there was no difference in the risk of myocardial infarction, stroke, new-onset heart failure, coronary revascularization, or all-cause mortality between patients initiating febuxostat compared with allopurinol. However, there seemed to be a trend toward an increased, albeit not statistically significant, risk for all-cause mortality in patients who used febuxostat for >3 years versus allopurinol for >3 years.

In recent years, several renal tubular urate transporter single nucleotide polymorphisms (SNPs), including those of the GLUT9, ABCG2 and URAT1 genes, have been described that influence the renal handling of uric acid and modulate serum urate levels. In the present study, we analyzed whether GLUT9, ABCG2 and URAT1 gene SNPs are able to influence uric acid levels and allopurinol response in patients with HPRT deficiency.\nMETHODS: Three SNPs, URAT1 rs11231825, GLUT9 rs16890979 and ABCG2 rs2231142, previously associated in our population with hyperuricemia and gout, were analyzed in 27 patients with HPRT deficiency treated with allopurinol for at least 5 years.\nRESULTS: Patients with HPRT deficiency having allele A of rs16890979 in the GLUT9 gene present with a lower serum urate concentration at diagnosis, before allopurinol treatment is instituted, and need lower allopurinol doses to maintain serum urate levels between 268 and 446 μmol\/L (4.5 and 7.5 mg\/dL). No relationship between rs2231142 in the ABCG2 gene or rs11231825 in the URAT1 gene and serum urate levels or allopurinol response was found in our patients with HPRT deficiency.\nCONCLUSIONS: GLUT9 SNPs influence the renal handling of uric acid and modulate serum urate levels and the response to treatment in patients with uric acid overproduction due to HPRT deficiency.",

Using an updated model with a sensitivity analysis, we examined the predictive performance of the PK-PD model, using datasets obtained from the medical records of patients who received febuxostat from March 2011 to December 2015 at Tokyo Women's Medical University Hospital. Multivariate regression analysis was performed to explore clinical variables to improve the predictive performance of the model.\nRESULTS: A total of 1199 serum urate values were retrieved from 168 patients (age: 60.5 ± 17.7 years; 71.4% male) who were receiving febuxostat as a treatment for hyperuricaemia. There was a significant correlation (r = 0.68; P < 0.01) between the serum urate levels observed and those predicted by the modified PK-PD model. A multivariate regression analysis revealed that the predictive performance of the model could be improved further by considering comorbidities (such as diabetes mellitus), estimated glomerular filtration rate (eGFR) and the coadministration of loop diuretics (r = 0.77, P < 0.01).\nCONCLUSIONS: The PK-PD model may be useful for predicting individualized maintenance doses of febuxostat in real-world patients.",

        "Published":null,
        "Abstract":"Recently, the US Food and Drug Administration (FDA) issued a public safety alert, responding to the results of the now-published Cardiovascular Safety of Febuxostat and Allopurinol in Patients With Gout and Cardiovascular Morbidities (CARES) trial. The CARES trial showed no significant difference between allopurinol and febuxostat in the primary composite end point of cardiovascular (CV) events in subjects with gout and established CV comorbidities at baseline. However, there was a significantly increased risk of CV and all-cause mortality with febuxostat. Urate-lowering therapy (ULT) is central to the long-term management of gout, and xanthine oxidoreductase inhibitor (XOI) therapy is the consensus first-line approach. Allopurinol is generally the first XOI used, but febuxostat is an effective XOI option, and is commonly used when allopurinol is not tolerated. These data are further relevant since CV comorbidities are common in gout. Here, we examine why the CARES trial was done, and discuss other, ongoing comparative studies of febuxostat and allopurinol whose results are awaited. We assess the strengths and limitations of the CARES trial, and appraise the robustness and biologic plausibility of the results. The CARES trial does not prove that febuxostat raises CV mortality risk, but suggests greater risk with febuxostat than allopurinol. The CARES trial results do not support first-line use of febuxostat ULT, and raise questions about febuxostat placement at various pharmacologic ULT decision tree branches. Alternatives to febuxostat that are frequently effective include allopurinol dose escalation and uricosuric therapy alone or combined with allopurinol. The FDA safety alert highlights the need for shared ULT medical decision-making with gout patients, including discussion of the CV safety of febuxostat.",

The aim of this Phase 2a, randomized, open-label study was to investigate the multiple-dose pharmacodynamics, pharmacokinetics and safety of oral verinurad combined with febuxostat vs febuxostat alone and verinurad alone.\nMETHODS: Japanese male subjects aged 21-65 years with gout (n = 37) or asymptomatic hyperuricaemia (n = 35) and serum urate (sUA) ⩾8 mg\/dl were randomized to febuxostat (10, 20, 40 mg) in combination with verinurad (2.5-10 mg), verinurad alone (2.5-15 mg), febuxostat alone (10, 20, 40 mg) or benzbromarone alone (50 mg). There were four treatment periods per cohort and each treatment period was 7 days. Study drugs were administered once-daily after breakfast. Plasma, serum and urine samples were measured at pre-set intervals on days -1, 7, 14, 21 and 28.\nRESULTS: Verinurad combined with febuxostat decreased sUA in dose-dependent manner, providing greater sUA lowering than febuxostat alone at the same dose (P < 0.001). Urinary uric acid excretion rate was increased by verinurad, reduced by febuxostat and comparable to baseline for verinurad combined with febuxostat. Verinurad from 2.5 mg to 15 mg was well tolerated, with no withdrawals due to adverse events. Laboratory assessments showed no clinically meaningful changes during combination treatment.\nCONCLUSION: Verinurad combined with febuxostat decreased sUA dose-dependently while maintaining uric acid excretion similar to baseline. All dose combinations of verinurad and febuxostat were generally well tolerated. These data support continued investigation of oral verinurad in patients with gout.\nTRIAL REGISTRATION: ClinicalTrials.gov, https:\/\/clinicaltrials.gov, NCT02317861.",

Prevalence ratios (95% confidence intervals) comparing gout cases and controls were calculated, overall and by sex. Crude and age-standardized prevalence (95% confidence interval) of all comorbidities in gout patients were calculated, to show differences between sexes, taking also the higher age at diagnosis in women into account.\nRESULTS: All examined comorbidities were 1.2-2.5-fold more common in gout patients at diagnosis than in population controls in both sexes. Women with gout were on average 6 years older than men at first gout diagnosis and most comorbidities, including obesity and diuretic use, were or tended to be more frequent in women than in men. When standardizing for age, women had a higher prevalence of thromboembolism (6.6% vs 5.2%) and chronic obstructive pulmonary disease (3.1% vs 2.4%). Men, on the other hand, had a higher prevalence of coronary heart disease (9.4% vs 6.4%), atrial fibrillation (9.0% vs 6.0%), congestive heart failure (7.7% vs 6.6%) and stroke (4.1% vs 3.3%).\nCONCLUSIONS: The occurrence of most comorbidities was significantly increased at first diagnosis of gout in both sexes. Women were older at diagnosis and had higher occurrence of most comorbidities, including obesity and diuretic use, factors that increase serum urate, and this needs to be taken into account when starting and optimizing urate lowering therapy. These sex differences were attenuated when standardizing for age and the occurrence of cardiovascular diseases was actually higher in men.",

        "Abstract":"Febuxostat (FXT) is a urate-lowering drug and xanthine oxidase inhibitor which is used for the treatment of hyperuricemia and gout caused by increased levels of uric acid in the blood (hyperuricemia). The present study aims to provide deeper knowledge of the structural, vibrational spectroscopic and physiochemical properties of FXT based on monomeric and dimeric model with the aid of combination of experimental and computational methods. The conformational analysis of form Q has been done to predict the possible structure of unknown form A. Vibrational spectra of form A and Q has been compared to get an idea of hydrogen bonding interactions of form A. A computational study of FXT has been executed at different level (B3LYP, M06-2X, WB97XD) of theory and 6-31 G (d, p) basis set for dimeric model to elucidate the nature of intermolecular hydrogen bond. The red shift observed in the stretching modes of OH, CO groups and blue shift in stretching mode of CN group in experimental as well as in theoretical spectra explains the involvement of these groups in intermolecular hydrogen bonding. NBO analysis shows that change in electron density (ED) in the lone pair orbital to σ* antibonding orbital (LP1 (N39) → σ* (O3-H38)) with maximum value of E(2) energy confirms the presence of hydrogen bond (N39⋯H38-O3) leading to dimer formation. Study of topological parameters was executed for dimer using Bader's atoms in molecules (AIM) theory predicting the partially covalent nature of hydrogen bonds present in the molecule. The study of molecular electrostatic potential surface (MEPS) map ascertains that the CO, CN group are prone to electrophilic attack and OH group is active towards nucleophilic attack. The lower energy band gap and higher value of softness of dimeric model of FXT indicates its more reactivity, polarisability than monomeric model. The local reactivity descriptors predict the order of reactive sites towards electrophilic, nucleophilic and radical attack. An investigation made to determine the ligand protein interaction of FXT through docking with different molecular targets reveals the inhibitive as well as antibacterial nature of FXT.",

        "Abstract":"BACKGROUND: Febuxostat immediate release (IR), a xanthine oxidase inhibitor, is indicated for the management of hyperuricemia in patients with gout by lowering urate levels. An extended release (XR) formulation of febuxostat was developed to provide equal or superior efficacy on urate lowering compared with the IR formulation and potentially lower the risk of treatment-initiated gout flares due to an altered pattern of drug exposure. The present study evaluated the efficacy and safety of febuxostat XR and IR formulations in patients with gout and moderate renal impairment (estimated glomerular filtrate rate ≥ 30 and < 60 ml\/min).\nMETHODS: This was an exploratory, 3-month, phase II, multicenter, placebo-controlled, double-blind proof-of-concept study. Patients (n = 189) were randomized 1:1:1:1:1 to receive placebo or febuxostat IR 40 mg, XR 40 mg, IR 80 mg, or XR 80 mg once daily. Endpoints included: proportion of patients with serum uric acid (sUA) < 5.0 mg\/dl at month 3 (primary endpoint), proportion of patients with sUA < 6.0 mg\/dl at month 3, and proportion of patients with ≥ 1 gout flare requiring treatment over 3 months.\nRESULTS: At month 3, all febuxostat treatment groups were associated with greater proportions of patients achieving sUA < 5.0 mg\/dl (p < 0.05 vs placebo). A greater proportion of patients receiving XR 40 mg achieved sUA < 5.0 mg\/dl versus those receiving IR 40 mg (p = 0.034); proportions were similar in the IR 80 mg and XR 80 mg groups. Higher proportions of febuxostat-treated patients achieved sUA < 6.0 mg\/dl at month 3 (p < 0.05 vs placebo) and experienced ≥ 1 gout flare (significant for all comparisons, except XR 40 mg). Incidences of treatment-related adverse events were low across all treatment groups; the majority were mild or moderate with no apparent trends correlating with IR or XR doses. The most common treatment-emergent adverse event was hypertension. One death (unrelated to the study drug) was reported.\nCONCLUSIONS: These exploratory data demonstrate that febuxostat (XR and IR) formulations were effective and well tolerated in patients with gout and moderate renal impairment.\nTRIAL REGISTRATION: ClinicalTrials.gov, NCT02128490 Registered on 29 April 2014.",

Wnt5a\/Ror2 signaling drives EMT in many kidney pathologies. This study sought to evaluate the involvement of Wnt5a\/Ror2 in hyperuricemia-induced EMT in kidney tubular injury.\nMETHODS: A hyperuricemia model was performed in male Swiss background mice (3 months old, 30-40 g) with daily intraperitoneal injections of 125 mg\/kg body weight (BW) of uric acid. The mice were terminated on day 7 (UA7, n=5) and on day 14 (UA14, n=5). Allopurinol groups (UAl7 and UAl14, each n=5) were added with oral 50 mg\/kg BW of allopurinol treatment. The serum uric acid level was quantified, and tubular injury was assessed based on PAS staining. Reverse transcriptase-PCR was done to quantify Wnt5a, Ror2, E-cadherin, and vimentin expressions. IHC staining was done for E-cadherin and collagen I. We used the Shapiro-Wilk for normality testing and one-way ANOVA for variance analysis with a P<0.05 as significance level using SPSS 22 software.\nRESULTS: The hyperuricemia groups had a higher uric acid level, which was associated with a higher tubular injury score. Meanwhile, the allopurinol groups had a significantly lower uric acid level and tubular injury than the uric acid groups. Reverse transcriptase-PCR revealed downregulation of the E-cadherin expression. While vimentin and collagen I expression are upregulated, which was associated with a higher Wnt5a expression. However, the allopurinol groups had reverse results. Immunostaining revealed a reduction in E-cadherin staining in the epithelial cells and collagen I positive staining in the epithelial cells and the interstitial areas.\nCONCLUSION: Hyperuricemia induced tubular injury, which might have been mediated by EMT through the activation of Wnt5a.",

Verinurad increased the maximum observed plasma concentration (C ) for allopurinol by 33%; the area under the plasma concentration-time curve (AUC) was unaffected. Oxypurinol C and AUC were reduced 32% and 38%, respectively, by verinurad. Colchicine plasma exposure was unaltered by verinurad. The maximum decrease in serum urate was greater with verinurad + allopurinol (65%) than with verinurad (51%) or allopurinol (43%) alone.

        "Abstract":"Urate-lowering therapy (ULT) is a recommended life-long treatment for gout patients. However, despite these recommendations, recurrent gout attacks are commonly observed in clinical practice. The purpose of this study was to assess the levels of compliance and persistence to ULT in The Netherlands, in order to reflect on the current gout care delivered by health professionals. Anonymous prescription records were obtained from IQVIA's Dutch retrospective longitudinal prescription database, containing ULT dispensing data for allopurinol, febuxostat, and benzbromarone from November 2013 to July 2017. Compliance to ULT was determined by calculating the proportion of days covered (PDC) over 12 months. Persistence over 12 months was evaluated by determining the time to discontinuation, without surpassing a refill gap of > 30 days. Association of PDC and persistence with age, gender, and first prescriber were examined using beta regression- and cox-regression models, respectively. There were 45,654 patients who met the inclusion criteria. Overall, 51.7% of the patients had a ULT coverage of ≥ 80% of the days in 1 year (PDC ≥ 0.80), and 42.7% of the patients were still persistent after 1 year. Men, older patients, and patients whose first prescriber was a rheumatologist were more persistent and had a higher PDC. Our results show that medication adherence to ULT after 1 year is suboptimal, considering that current guidelines recommend ULT as a life-long treatment. Future studies addressing the reasons for treatment cessation and improving treatment adherence seem warranted.",

This review covers 11 drugs in development, including a xanthine oxidase inhibitor (topiroxostat), uricosurics (verinurad, arhalofenate, UR-1102, tranilast), dual inhibitors (RLBN1001, KUX-1151), a uricase (pergsiticase), an inhibitor of hypoxanthine production (ulodesine), and drugs with yet-to-explain mechanisms of action (levotofisopam, tuna extracts).\nEXPERT OPINION: Drugs well advanced in their development - particularly arhalofenate, verinurad and topiroxostat - open the prospect of patient-comorbidity-tailored HU management. Development of novel therapies provides new insight into our understanding of gout and HU, particularly potential pathogenicity. Apart from potency to decrease serum urate levels and good tolerance profiles, novel therapies will need to focus on administration modalities facilitating treatment adherence.",

However, the long-term effect of lowering uric acid with febuxostat on renal function and blood pressure has not been elucidated.\nMETHODS: This was a 2 years retrospective observational study. 86 CKD patients with hyperuricemia who continued with allopurinol (allopurinol group, n = 30), switched from allopurinol to febuxostat (switched group, n = 25), or were newly prescribed febuxostat (febuxostat group, n = 31) were included in this study. Serum uric acid, estimated glomerular filtration rate (eGFR), blood pressure, and urinary protein were analyzed. Moreover, the impact of serum uric acid reduction on renal function and blood pressure was assessed.\nRESULTS: Serum uric acid in the switched and febuxostat groups was significantly reduced at 6 months (switched group; 8.49 ± 1.32-7.19 ± 1.14 mg\/dL, p < 0.0001, febuxostat group; 9.43 ± 1.63-6.31 ± 0.90 mg\/dL, p < 0.0001). In the allopurinol group, serum uric acid was increased (6.86 ± 0.87-7.10 ± 0.85 mg\/dL, p = 0.0213). eGFR was significantly increased (35.2 ± 12.8-37.3 ± 13.9 mL\/min\/1.73 m, p = 0.0232), while mean arterial pressure (93.1 ± 10.8-88.2 ± 9.5 mmHg, p = 0.0039) was significantly decreased at 6 months in the febuxostat group, resulting in the retention of eGFR for 2 years.\nCONCLUSIONS: The impact of serum uric acid reduction might have beneficial effects on CKD progression and blood pressure.

        "Abstract":"Current urate-lowering therapy (ULT) includes three direct acting drugs (allopurinol, febuxostat, Rasburicase) and at least four 'indirect' drugs with other important targets (canagliflozin, losartan, fenofibrate and sevelamer). Moreover, the alcalinization of urines using bicarbonate can be used to dissolve urate crystals and the clinician may discontinue several drugs are known to increase serum levels of uric acid, such as diuretics, aspirin, cyclosporine, theophylline, mycophenolate and ACE inhibitors. While there is a consensus to start ULT in cases of symptomatic hyperuricemia (gout, urate-nephrolithiasis), the very frequent conditions of asymptomatic hyperuricemia remains a major conundrum. The effect of asymptomatic hyperuricemia on kidney function has had fluctuating positions over decades. The conflicting results might indicate: (i) the presence of counterbalancing positive and negative effects on kidney function of both serum uric acid and urate-lowering agents, (ii) the presence of a subpopulation of patients, as yet unidentified, which could truly benefit from a urate-lowering therapy. Therefore, today the treatment of asymptomatic hyperuricemia is not recommended nor excluded by current guidelines. Here we suggest that a possible guide for the treatment of asymptomatic hyperuricemia might be the presence of urate crystals in the urine sediment and\/or signs of asymptomatic articular damage by urates, identified by musculo-skeletal ultrasound. Moreover, a watchful analysis of the trend in creatinine\/eGFR, proteinuria or urate levels might also guide the clinician. Initiation of ULT and follow-up in cases of asymptomatic hyperuricemia should consider urine sediment analysis, musculoskeletal ultrasound and trends in creatinine, proteinuria and serum urate levels.",

Twenty-three subjects were randomized and received once-daily doses of verinurad (or placebo) or febuxostat alone (days 1-7 and days 15-21), or verinurad + febuxostat on days 8-14. For combinations, subjects received verinurad 10 mg + febuxostat 40 mg or verinurad 2.5 mg + febuxostat 80 mg. Plasma\/serum and urine samples were analyzed for verinurad, febuxostat, and uric acid. Safety was assessed by adverse events and laboratory tests. Febuxostat 40 mg had no effect on plasma exposure of verinurad 10 mg, whereas febuxostat 80 mg increased the maximum observed plasma concentration and the area under the plasma concentration-time curve of verinurad 2.5 mg by 25% and 33%, respectively.

This study evaluated the pharmacodynamics, pharmacokinetics and safety of verinurad in combination with febuxostat in adults with gout.\nMETHODS: The phase IIa, open-label, multicentre study randomised 64 subjects into one of five cohorts to receive febuxostat (40 or 80 mg) alone or in combination with verinurad 2.5-20 mg. Serial plasma\/serum and urine samples were assayed for verinurad and uric acid. Safety was assessed by adverse events, chemistry panels, ECGs and physical examinations.\nRESULTS: Serum pharmacodynamic data demonstrated the maximum percent decrease in serum urate (sUA) from baseline (E) at 8-12 hours after dosing. Verinurad with febuxostat decreased sUA in a dose-dependent manner. E for verinurad with febuxostat 40 mg ranged from 52% to 77% vs 42% for febuxostat 40 mg alone; E for verinurad with febuxostat 80 mg was 62%-82% vs 55% for febuxostat 80 mg alone. Urinary uric acid excretion rate was reduced below baseline by febuxostat alone and was comparable to baseline for verinurad with febuxostat. Verinurad plasma exposure increased with dose and was comparable when combined with febuxostat. No drug-drug interactions were observed. Verinurad was well tolerated with no clinically meaningful changes in laboratory values.\nCONCLUSION: Verinurad administered with febuxostat produced dose-dependent decreases in sUA while maintaining urinary uric acid levels comparable to baseline. These dose combinations of verinurad and febuxostat were generally well tolerated.

To complete these eCQMs, data are extracted from electronic health records (EHRs). The treatment of gout has been an area identified with gaps in quality of care. On behalf of the American College of Rheumatology (ACR), we sought to develop and test eCQMs to evaluate gout care.\nMETHODS: Drawing from the 2012 ACR gout guidelines, a working group developed candidate gout process measures that were evaluated by an interdisciplinary panel of health care stakeholders, the ACR Quality Measures Subcommittee (QMS), and ultimately the ACR Board of Directors for formal validity testing. For each of the selected gout eCQMs, 3 clinical sites using different EHR systems tested the scientific feasibility and validity of the measures. Measures appropriate for accountability were presented for national endorsement.\nRESULTS: Of the 10 proposed eCQMs, 4 were endorsed by the ACR QMS, 3 were incorporated into the ACR's Rheumatology Informatics System for Effectiveness (RISE) Registry, and 2 were endorsed by the National Quality Forum. The 3 eCQMs incorporated into RISE (evaluating indications for urate-lowering therapy [ULT]), monitoring serum urate, and treat-to-target outcome) demonstrated high validity and reliability. Proportions of patients passing these 3 eCQMs in RISE and at the 3 clinical testing sites ranged between 32% and 58%, indicating significant room for improvement in care.\nCONCLUSION: Three eCQMs have been validated and implemented into RISE. Two of these measures (evaluating indications for ULT and monitoring serum urate) are available for use in federal quality reporting programs. Performance on these measures suggests there is significant room for improvement in the management of gout.",

This review aimed to quantify ULT adherence in adult patients with gout.\nMETHODS: This analysis examined studies in PubMed, Web of Science, CNKI Scholar and WanFang databases from inception to January 2017. Papers were selected by inclusion and exclusion criteria in the context. Random-effect meta-analysis estimated adherence.\nRESULTS: 22 studies were found by the inclusion criteria, which involved 1 37 699 patients with gout. Four ways to define adherence were reported. Meta-analysis revealed that the overall adherence rate was 47% (95% CI 42% to 52%, I=99.7%). Adherence rate to ULT was 42% (95% CI 37% to 47%, I=99.8%) for prescription claims, 71% (95% CI 63% to 79%) for pill count, 66% (95% CI 50% to 81%, I=86.3%) for self-report and 63% (95% CI 42% to 83%, I=82.9%) for interview, respectively. The influential factor on adherence rate was country of origin.\nCONCLUSIONS: Among adult patients with gout, overall adherence rate to ULT was as low as 47%, which suggested that clinicians should pay more attention to medication adherence in patients with gout to effectively improve adherence to ULT.",

Summary estimates of weighted mean differences (WMDs) and relative risk (RR) were obtained by using random-effect or fixed-effect models. Sensitivity analyses were performed to identify the source of heterogeneity.\nRESULTS: A total of 12 randomized controlled trials with 832 CKD participants were included in the analysis. Pooled estimate for eGFR was in favor of lowering serum uric acid therapy with a mean difference (MD) of 3.88 ml\/min\/1.73 m, 95% CI 1.26-6.49 ml\/min\/1.73 m, p = .004 and this was consistent with results for serum creatinine.

        "Abstract":"BACKGROUND: To investigate the efficacy of febuxostat in hyperuricemic patients with chronic kidney disease (CKD), relevant randomized clinical trials (RCTs) were analyzed.\nMETHODS: We used PubMed, Medline, ISI Web of Science, CBMdisc, and Cochrane Library databases to conduct a systematic literature research. A fixed-effects model was used to evaluate the standardized mean differences (SMDs) with 95% confidence intervals (CIs). We conducted subgroup analysis, sensitivity analysis, and analyzed publication bias, to comprehensively estimate the renoprotective effects of febuxostat in hyperuricemic patients with CKD.\nRESULTS: Among 296 retrieved studies, 5 relevant RCTs were included in the meta-analysis. The result showed that serum estimated glomerular filtration rate (eGFR) was improved after febuxostat treatment in hyperuricemic patients with CKD, with an SMD (95% CI) of 0.24 [-0.17 to 0.43] and P = .67 (fixed-effects model). No heterogeneity was observed across studies (I  = 0% and P = .67). Subgroup analysis suggested that treatment-related reductions in serum eGFR levels were not related to drug doses, intervention times, or region.\nCONCLUSIONS: The present meta-analysis suggests that febuxostat may slow the progression of mild-to-moderate CKD. Given the limited number of included studies, additional large sample-size RCTs are required to determine the long-term renoprotective effects of febuxostat in hyperuricemic patients with CKD.",

        "Abstract":"Gout is a crystal-induced, metabolically determined inflammatory rheumatic disease with increasing prevalence. In clinical practice, gout causes frequent diagnostic as well as therapeutic problems. The golden diagnostic standard is crystalographic analysis and evidence of monosodium urate crystals in the polarization microscope; if this is not available, the diagnosis can be established through a combination of clinical, laboratory and imaging techniques. The acute gouty attack must be treated by quick administration of anti-inflammatory medicines, with available alternatives being nonsteroidal antirheumatic drugs (NSA), colchicine and glucocorticoids. When the attack subsides, hypouricemic therapy is initiated which should combine the regimen and diet measures and pharmacological treatment. Recommendations for the treatment of gout were published by the EULAR and the Czech Society for Rheumatology. Recently a new strategy appeared known as Treat to target - T2T. This principle has been successfully used in the treatment of rheumatiod arthritis and spondyloarthritis. The publication is structured as four overarching principles and nine Recommendations. The recommendations emphasize long-term maintenance of serum levels of uric acid below 360 μmol\/l as the basic gout-related target in all patients, and below 300 μmol\/l for patients with tophies. It is recommended to administer prophylactic small doses of colchicine for at least 3-6 months on the commencement of hypouricemic therapy. The Recommendations further emphasize the need for regular monitoring of comorbidities and the kidney function. A separate recommendation is concerned with necessary education of patients and their motivation toward compliance with regimen measures and increased physical activity.Key words: colchicine - gouty arthritis - treat to target principle.",

        "Abstract":"OBJECTIVES: The primary efficacy outcome in trials of urate lowering therapy (ULT) for gout is serum urate (SU). The aim of this study was to examine the strength of the relationship between SU and patient-important outcomes to determine whether SU is an adequate surrogate endpoint for clinical trials.\nMETHODS: Multiple databases through October 2017 were searched. Randomized controlled trials comparing any ULT in people with gout with any control or placebo, ≥three months duration were included. Open label extension (OLE) trial data were included in secondary analyses. Standardized data elements were extracted independently by two reviewers.\nRESULTS: Ten RCTs and 3 OLE studies were identified. From the RCTs (maximum duration 24 months) meta-regression did not reveal an association between the relative risk of a gout flare and the difference in proportions of individuals with SU < 6mg\/dL (P = 0.47; R = 8%). In a post hoc analysis, the ratio of the time in months at which the proportion of individuals having a flare was reported\/time in months at which the proportion of individuals with SU < 6mg\/dL was reported was calculated and studies where the ratio was <2 were excluded. Using the remaining 6 studies there was an association between proportion of individuals achieving SU < 6mg\/dL and gout flares (over patient years). Duration of ULT was inversely associated with the proportion of patients experiencing a flare. Study duration and variability in reporting of outcomes limited the analysis. Observational studies supported the trend of fewer flares in those with lower SU.\nCONCLUSIONS: Based on aggregate clinical trial-level data an association between SU and gout flare could not be confirmed. However, based on observational ecological study design data-including longer duration extension studies-SU < 6mg\/dL was associated with reduced gout flares.",

Participants were classified according to the type of ULD prescribed. We analysed the maximal dose of ULD (primary outcome variable), serum urate (SU) reduction, and the achievement of different SU targets (6 mg\/dL, 5 mg\/dL, and 4 mg\/dL), according to the type of ULD prescribed and use of diuretics (loop and\/or thiazide).

Significantly fewer participants in the allopurinol plus diuretics subgroup achieved SU levels of less than 5 mg\/dL, but we found no other significant differences in SU targets associated with diuretics. Regarding the maximum ULD dose, a simple linear regression suggested an inverse relationship with diuretics (beta = - 0.125, p = 0.073), but this did not hold in the multivariable analysis (beta = - 0.47, p = 0.833).

        "Abstract":"BACKGROUND: Until very recently the only therapeutic alternative for the management of patients affected by gout\/hyperuricemia that did not respond to a first-line treatment based on allopurinol alone or who cannot tolerate allopurinol was febuxostat, a xanthine oxidase non-purine-selective inhibitor. Lately, however, a new therapeutic alternative has become available for the management of this pathology: lesinurad, a urate transporter inhibitor.\nOBJECTIVE: To objective of this study was to evaluate the cost effectiveness of lesinurad\/allopurinol in comparison with febuxostat as a second-line therapeutic strategy for the management of patients affected by gout and hyperuricemia that did not respond to a first-line therapy based on allopurinol alone.\nMETHODS: A Markov model was built based on the natural history of the pathology; patients entered the model according to their level of serum uric acid concentration and flowed across it according to their response to the therapy. The analysis was carried out considering the perspective of the Italian National Health Service on a lifetime horizon and 6-month cycles. Costs and quality-adjusted life-years (QALYs) were discounted at a 3.5% yearly rate. The results of the model were expressed in terms of incremental cost-effectiveness ratio (ICER). Both a one-way and a multi-way Monte-Carlo analysis were carried out in order to check the robustness of the results achieved.\nRESULTS: The ICER derived from the comparison was equal to €77.53\/QALY on the lifetime horizon, as there was a higher level of costs associated with the combination as compared with febuxostat (€10,658.27 vs. €10,645.87, for a differential of €12.40) and a higher level of QALYs achieved (7.77 vs. 7.61, for a differential of 0.16).\nCONCLUSIONS: The lesinurad\/allopurinol combination is recommended for the treatment of patients affected by gout\/hyperuricemia in the Italian Health System as it appears to be cost effective and thus sustainable for the Italian healthcare sector.",

        "Abstract":"BACKGROUND: Despite being regarded as an easily-treatable disease, gout diagnosis and management can be challenging.\nREVIEW: This review discusses current issues in gout management and proposes some potential solutions. Gout diagnosis should be reached as early as possible and often requires specific tests, such as synovial fluid analysis or imaging techniques that are not available in most centers, leaving healthcare professionals to rely only on clinical presentations and their experience. In addition, gout management requires the evaluation of multiple aspects, such as monitoring of serum uric acid (sUA) level (which should be reduced to <6 mg\/dL) to ensure adherence and efficacy of treatment, evaluation of patient's risk profile and comorbidities, and continuous assessments to manage clinical manifestations. An important premise in gout management is non-pharmacological intervention; however, pharmacological urate-lowering therapy is crucial for an optimal control of the disease. Available options include xanthine-oxidase inhibitors (XOI), targeting uric acid overproduction, and uricosuric agents which target the predominant cause of hyperuricemia (under-excretion). Among these, lesinurad is the novel uricosuric agent to be used in combination with XOI in patients with gout not adequately controlled with XOI alone, which can further contribute to the control of hyperuricemia in gout.\nCONCLUSIONS: Multidisciplinary management is crucial for the diagnosis and treatment of gout, in order to ensure treatment continuity and improve management. This review, therefore, advises that educational activities for General Practitioners and specialists should be implemented to help raise awareness on gout diagnosis, monitoring, and treatment.",

        "Abstract":"BACKGROUND: Hyperuricemia is a leading risk factor for the development of chronic kidney disease (CKD). We hypothesized that lowering serum uric acid (SUA) with allopurinol in hyperuricemic children with CKD may reduce the risk of CKD progression.\nMETHODS: A total of 70 children, aged 3-15 years, with elevated serum uric acid level (SUA) > 5.5 mg\/dL and CKD stages 1-3 were prospectively randomized to receive allopurinol 5 mg\/kg\/day (study group, n = 38) or no treatment (control group, n = 32) for 4 months. The primary and secondary outcomes were changes in estimated glomerular filtration rate (eGFR) (> 10 mL\/min\/1.73m) and the SUA (> 1.0 mg\/dL) from baseline values, respectively.\nRESULTS: Baseline age, gender, blood pressure (BP), body mass index (BMI), SUA, high-sensitive C-reactive protein (hsCRP), and eGFR were similar in allopurinol and control subjects. Allopurinol treatment resulted in a decrease in SUA, a decrease in systolic and diastolic BP, a decrease in hsCRP, and an increase in eGFR compared with the baseline values (p < 0.05 for all). No significant difference was observed in the control hyperuricemic subjects. In multiple regression analysis after incorporating variables (age, gender, BMI, systolic and diastolic BP, CRP, and SUA), eGFR was independently related to SUA both before and after treatments (p = 0.03 vs. p = 0.02, respectively). All patients in the study group tolerated allopurinol, and there were no adverse reactions observed by physical examination or reported by patients.\nCONCLUSION: Urate-lowering therapy with allopurinol, over a 4-month period, can improve renal function in children with CKD stages 1-3.",

        "Abstract":"This review article summarizes the relevant English literature on gout from 2010 through April 2017. It emphasizes that the current epidemiology of gout indicates a rising prevalence worldwide, not only in Western countries but also in Southeast Asia, in close relationship with the obesity and metabolic syndrome epidemics. New pathogenic mechanisms of chronic hyperuricaemia focus on the gut (microbiota, ABCG2 expression) after the kidney. Cardiovascular and renal comorbidities are the key points to consider in terms of management. New imaging tools are available, including US with key features and dual-energy CT rendering it able to reveal deposits of urate crystals. These deposits are now included in new diagnostic and classification criteria. Overall, half of the patients with gout are readily treated with allopurinol, the recommended xanthine oxidase inhibitor (XOI), with prophylaxis for flares with low-dose daily colchicine. The main management issues are related to patient adherence, because gout patients have the lowest rate of medication possession ratio at 1 year, but they also include clinical inertia by physicians, meaning XOI dosage is not titrated according to regular serum uric acid level measurements for targeting serum uric acid levels for uncomplicated (6.0 mg\/dl) and complicated gout, or the British Society for Rheumatology recommended target (5.0 mg\/dl). Difficult-to-treat gout encompasses polyarticular flares, and mostly patients with comorbidities, renal or heart failure, leading to contraindications or side effects of standard-of-care drugs (colchicine, NSAIDs, oral steroids) for flares; and tophaceous and\/or destructive arthropathies, leading to switching between XOIs (febuxostat) or to combining XOI and uricosurics.",

This report includes 141 patients evaluated at baseline and 6 months plus 101 of them completing a 12-month follow-up in 2012. Clinical data including the OMERACT domains for chronic gout were collected at baseline and every 6 months.

This phase IIa study evaluated the pharmacodynamics, pharmacokinetics and safety of verinurad combined with allopurinol versus allopurinol alone in adults with gout.\nMETHODS: Forty-one subjects were randomised into two cohorts of verinurad (2.5-20 mg) plus allopurinol (300 mg once daily) versus allopurinol 300 mg once daily, 600 mg once daily or 300 mg twice daily alone. Each treatment period was 7 days. Serial plasma\/serum and urine samples were assayed for verinurad, allopurinol, oxypurinol and uric acid.\nRESULTS: Serum pharmacodynamic data pooled across cohorts demonstrated maximum per cent decreases in serum urate (sUA) from baseline (E) at 7-12 hours after verinurad plus allopurinol treatment. Combination treatment decreased sUA in dose-dependent manner: least-squares means E was 47%, 59%, 60%, 67%, 68% and 74% for verinurad doses 2.5, 5, 7.5, 10, 15 and 20 mg plus allopurinol 300 mg once daily, versus 40%, 54% and 54% for allopurinol 300 mg once daily, 600 mg once daily and 300 mg twice daily.

        "Abstract":"UNLABELLED: As a widely used anti-gout drug, benzbromarone has been found to induce hepatic toxicity in patients during clinical treatment. Previous studies have reported that benzbromarone is metabolized via cytochrome P450, thus causing mitochondrial toxicity in hepatocytes. In this study, we found that benzbromarone significantly aggravated hepatic steatosis in both obese db\/db mice and high fat diet (HFD)-induced obese (DIO) mouse models. However, benzbromarone had less effect on the liver of lean mice. It was found that the expression of mRNAs encoding lipid metabolism and some liver-specific genes were obviously disturbed in benzbromarone-treated DIO mice compared to the control group. The inflammatory and oxidative stress factors were also activated in the liver of benzbromarone-treated DIO mice. In accordance with the in vivo results, an in vitro experiment using human hepatoma HepG2 cells also confirmed that benzbromarone promoted intracellular lipid accumulation under high free fatty acids (FFAs) conditions by regulating the expression of lipid metabolism genes. Importantly, prolonged treatment of benzbromarone significantly increased cell apoptosis in HepG2 cells in the presence of high FFAs. In addition, in benzbromarone-treated hyperuricemic patients, serum transaminase levels were positively correlated with patients' obesity level.\nCONCLUSION: This study demonstrated that benzbromarone aggravated hepatic steatosis in obese individuals, which could subsequently contribute to hepatic cell injury, suggesting a novel toxicological mechanism in benzbromarone-induced hepatotoxicity.",

        "Abstract":"PURPOSE OF REVIEW: Most current clinical guidelines for gout management advocate a treat-to-target serum urate approach, although notable differences exist. Serum urate is a rational target for gout treatment given the central role of urate in disease causality, its association with key outcomes and its practicality of use in clinical practice. This review analyses the evidence for this strategy in gout.\nRECENT FINDINGS: Recent studies have confirmed the efficacy of urate-lowering therapy in achieving serum urate targets, both in trials using fixed doses and those applying a treat-to-target strategy. In a limited number of long-term studies (> 12-month duration), interventions that incorporate a treat-to-target serum urate approach have been shown to promote regression of tophi, reduce the frequency of gout flares and improve MRI-detected synovitis. A strong case can be made for a treat-to-target serum urate strategy in gout, supported by existing knowledge of disease pathophysiology, outcomes from urate-lowering therapy studies and emerging results of randomised strategy trials of sufficient duration.",

The aim of the current study was to determine whether allopurinol dose escalation is associated with cause-specific mortality in patients with gout.\nMETHODS: In this 10-year observational, active-comparator study of US Veterans with gout who initiated treatment with allopurinol, propensity score matching, Cox proportional hazards models, and competing risks regression analyses were used to assess differences in cause-specific mortality between patients whose allopurinol dose was escalated (dose escalators) and those whose allopurinol dose was not escalated or was reduced (non-escalators) over a 2-year period.\nRESULTS: Among the 6,428 dose escalators and 6,428 matched non-escalators, there were 2,867 deaths during the observation period (40.4 deaths per 1,000 person-years). Dose escalators experienced an increase in all-cause mortality (hazard ratio [HR] 1.08, 95% confidence interval [95% CI] 1.01-1.17), with the effect sizes being similar for incidence of cardiovascular-related deaths (HR 1.08, 95% CI 0.97-1.21) and cancer-related deaths (HR 1.06, 95% CI 0.88-1.27), although neither reached statistical significance. Dose escalation to achieve the goal of lowering the serum urate (SU) level to <6.0 mg\/dl was infrequent. At 2 years, 10% of dose escalators were receiving a final daily dose of >300 mg and 31% had achieved the SU goal. In a sensitivity analysis limited to dose escalators achieving the SU goal, there was a nonsignificant reduction of 7% in the hazard of cardiovascular-related mortality (HR 0.93, 95% CI 0.76-1.14).\nCONCLUSION: This is the largest study to date to investigate the effects of allopurinol use on mortality and is the first to use a rigorous active-comparator design. Dose escalation was associated with a small (<10%) increase in all-cause mortality, thus showing that a strategy of allopurinol dose escalation, which in current real-life practice is characterized by limited dose increases, is unlikely to improve the survival of patients with gout.",

        "Abstract":"BACKGROUND: Gout is a painful disorder and is common in type 2 diabetes. Fenofibrate lowers uric acid and reduces gout attacks in small, short-term studies. Whether fenofibrate produces sustained reductions in uric acid and gout attacks is unknown.\nMETHODS: In the Fenofibrate Intervention and Event Lowering in Diabetes (FIELD) trial, participants aged 50-75 years with type 2 diabetes were randomly assigned to receive either co-micronised fenofibrate 200 mg once per day or matching placebo for a median of 5 years follow-up. We did a post-hoc analysis of recorded on-study gout attacks and plasma uric acid concentrations according to treatment allocation. The outcomes of this analysis were change in uric acid concentrations and risk of on-study gout attacks. The FIELD study is registered with ISRCTN, number ISRCTN64783481.\nFINDINGS: Between Feb 23, 1998, and Nov 3, 2000, 9795 patients were randomly assigned to fenofibrate (n=4895) or placebo (n=4900) in the FIELD study. Uric acid concentrations fell by 20·2% (95% CI 19·9-20·5) during the 6-week active fenofibrate run-in period immediately pre-randomisation (a reduction of 0·06 mmol\/L or 1 mg\/dL) and remained -20·1% (18·5-21·7, p<0·0001) lower in patients taking fenofibrate than in those on placebo in a random subset re-measured at 1 year. With placebo allocation, there were 151 (3%) first gout events over 5 years, compared with 81 (2%) among those allocated fenofibrate (HR with treatment 0·54, 95% CI 0·41-0·70; p<0·0001). In the placebo group, the cumulative proportion of patients with first gout events was 7·7% in patients with baseline uric acid concentration higher than 0·36 mmol\/L and 13·9% in those with baseline uric acid concentration higher than 0·42 mmol\/L, compared with 3·4% and 5·7%, respectively, in the fenofibrate group. Risk reductions were similar among men and women and those with dyslipidaemia, on diuretics, and with elevated uric acid concentrations. For participants with elevated baseline uric acid concentrations despite taking allopurinol at study entry, there was no heterogeneity of the treatment effect of fenofibrate on gout risk. Taking account of all gout events, fenofibrate treatment halved the risk (HR 0·48, 95% CI 0·37-0·60; p<0·0001) compared with placebo.\nINTERPRETATION: Fenofibrate lowered uric acid concentrations by 20%, and almost halved first on-study gout events over 5 years of treatment. Fenofibrate could be a useful adjunct for preventing gout in diabetes.\nFUNDING: None.",

        "Abstract":"14\nμ\nmax\nVerinurad (RDEA3170) is a second generation selective uric acid reabsorption inhibitor for the treatment of gout and asymptomatic hyperuricemia. Following a single oral solution of 10-mg dose of [C]verinurad (500 Ci), verinurad was rapidly absorbed with a median time to occurrence of maximum observed concentration (T) of 0.5 hours and terminal half-life of 15 hours. In plasma, verinurad constituted 21% of total radioactivity. Recovery of radioactivity in urine and feces was 97.1%. Unchanged verinurad was the predominant component in the feces (29.9%), whereas levels were low in the urine (1.2% excreted). Acylglucuronide metabolites M1 (direct glucuronidation) and M8 (glucuronidation of N-oxide) were formed rapidly after absorption of verinurad with terminal half-life values of approximately 13 and 18 hours, respectively. M1 and M8 constituted 32% and 31% of total radioactivity in plasma and were equimolar to verinurad on the basis of AUC ratios. M1 and M8 formed in the liver were biliary cleared with complete hydrolysis in the GI tract, as metabolites were not detected in the feces and\/or efflux across the sinusoidal membrane; M1 and M8 accounted for 29.2% and 32.5% of the radioactive dose in urine, respectively. In vitro studies demonstrated that CYP3A4 mediated the formation of the N-oxide metabolite (M4), which was further metabolized by glucuronyl transferases (UGTs) to form M8, as M4 was absent in plasma and only trace levels were present in the urine. Several UGTs mediated the formation of M1, which could also be further metabolized by CYP2C8. Overall, the major clearance route of verinurad is metabolism via UGTs and CYP3A4 and CYP2C8.",

        "Abstract":"To provide insight into pharmacological treatment of hyperuricemia we developed a semi-mechanistic, dynamical model of uric acid (UA) disposition in human. Our model represents the hyperuricemic state in terms of production of UA (rate, PUA), its renal filtration (glomerular filtration rate, GFR) and proximal tubular reabsorption (fractional excretion coefficient, FE). Model parameters were estimated using data from 9 Phase I studies of xanthine oxidase inhibitors (XOI) allopurinol and febuxostat and a novel uricosuric, the selective UA reabsorption inhibitor lesinurad, approved for use in combination with a XOI. The model was qualified for prediction of the effect of patients' GFR and FE on concentration of UA in serum (sUA) and UA excretion in urine and their response to drug treatment, using data from 2 Phase I and 4 Phase III studies of lesinurad. Percent reduction in sUA from baseline by a XOI is predicted to be independent of GFR, FE or PUA. Uricosurics are more effective in underexcreters of UA or patients with normal GFR. Co-administration of a XOI and an uricosuric agent should be considered for patients with high sUA first in the treatment algorithm of gout before uptitration of XOI. The XOI dose in combination with a uricosuric can be reduced compared to XOI alone for the same target sUA to the degree dependent on patient's GFR and FE. This exposure-response model of UA can be used to rationally select the best drug treatment option to lower elevated sUA in gout patients under differing pathophysiological situations.",

Baseline data included demographics, method of diagnosis, clinical features, comorbidities, urate-lowering therapy (ULT), prophylaxis and blood tests. Twelve months later, the most recent serum uric acid level was collected. Management was compared with audit standards derived from the 2006 EULAR recommendations, 2007 British Society for Rheumatology\/British Health Professionals in Rheumatology guideline and the National Institute for Health and Care Excellence febuxostat technology appraisal.\nRESULTS: Data were collected for 434 patients from 91 rheumatology departments (mean age 59.8 years, 82% male). Diagnosis was crystal-proven in 13%. Of 106 taking a diuretic, this was reduced\/stopped in 29%. ULT was continued\/initiated in 76% of those with one or more indication for ULT. One hundred and fifty-eight patients started allopurinol: the starting dose was most commonly 100 mg daily (82%); in those with estimated glomerular filtration rate <60 ml\/min the highest starting dose was 100 mg daily. Of 199 who started ULT, prophylaxis was co-prescribed for 94%. Fifty patients started a uricosuric or febuxostat: 84% had taken allopurinol previously. Of 44 commenced on febuxostat, 18% had a history of heart disease. By 12 months, serum uric acid levels ⩽360 and <300 μmol\/l were achieved by 45 and 25%, respectively.\nCONCLUSION: Gout management by UK rheumatologists concords well with guidelines for most audit standards.

        "Abstract":"BACKGROUND: Diabetic nephropathy (DN) is the leading cause of end-stage renal disease (ESRD) in the western world. Current treatment methods, with better control of glycemia and blood pressure, including renin-angiotensin system blockade (RASB), appear to have slowed the DN progression rate but have not substantially decreased the annual incidence of new DN ESRD cases. Thus, new treatment targets are needed.\nSUMMARY: Higher levels of serum uric acid (UA) are associated with increased risk of the clinical manifestations of DN in persons with types 1 and 2 diabetes. Also, UA is a strong predictor of DN progression. Two small, short-term, proof-of-concept clinical trials in which a minority of the patients had diabetes suggested that reduction of UA with allopurinol could decrease the rate of glomerular filtration rate (GFR) loss in persons with chronic kidney disease (CKD). However, a definitive trial to check whether UA reduction can benefit DN progression has not been conducted as yet. Preventing Early Renal Loss in Diabetes (PERL) is an ongoing trial in persons with type 1 diabetes and early to moderate GFR reduction. This 3-year randomized placebo controlled trial in 530 subjects is to check whether UA reduction with allopurinol can slow the rate of GFR decline as determined by the plasma disappearance of iohexol. Key Message: If the results of the PERL trial are positive, initiation of UA reduction treatment while GFR is relatively well preserved could delay ESRD in DN by 8-10 years, that is, considerably longer than the period that has been demonstrated for RASB. This could have important implications for the treatment of DN in particular and of CKD in general.",

        "Abstract":"Uric acid (UA) remains a risk factor for the progression of chronic kidney disease (CKD). Most observational studies showed a slight elevation in the serum UA level and this independently predicts the incidence and development of CKD. The recent meta-analysis, however, did not reach the conclusion that urate-lowering therapy with allopurinol retards the progression of CKD. The target level of serum UA if treated is another issue of debate. Our recent analysis by propensity score analysis has shown that the serum UA should be targeted below 6.0 mg\/dL to inhibit the progression towards end-stage renal disease. Underlying mechanisms whereby an increase in serum UA induces kidney injury have been elucidated in animal models. Hyperuricemic models can lead to systemic hypertension, arteriolosclerosis including afferent arteriolopathy as well as albuminuria probably due to the activation of oxidative stress. Discoveries of urate transporters have elucidated the novel mechanism of UA transport in the kidney and intestine. The intestinal ABCG2 may play a compensatory role in light of decreased renal clearance of UA in CKD model rats, the trigger of which is not a uremic toxin but serum UA itself. Insulin directly upregulates URAT1 and downregulates ABCG2 in the kidney tubules, suggesting a possible link between UA and metabolic syndrome. This review summarizes the recent knowledge on the causal effect of serum UA on the kidney injury.",

High uric acid plays an important role in several chronic diseases including kidney diseases such as lithiasis, gout nephropathy, and preeclampsia. In the last 30 years, it has been shown that reducing HyU with low protein and low purine diets in addition to allopurinol creates physiopathological conditions that produce a slight increase in the glomerular filtration rate (GFR). In recent years, in a new era of research in clinical, genetics, pharmacological, and epidemiologic fields, they have been moving forward to support the idea that reduction in HyU could benefit the chronic renal failure (CRF) patients (stage III-IV), thereby avoiding the drop of GFR for undefined mechanisms. There are several clinical trials in progress that show the HyU reducing to very low values and an increased GFR. In a young population, when treating HyU there is a reduction in high blood pressure. There are some reports showing that HyU could play a role in the diabetic nephropathy. Therefore, there have been some speculations that HyU treatment could stop the progression of CRF modifying the natural history of the diseases.

SBP and DBP were assessed using mercury sphygmomanometry. Hypertension was defined as SBP ≥140 mm Hg or DBP ≥90 mm Hg. Hyperuricemia (HUA) was defined as sUA concentration of >7 mg\/dL in men and >6 mg\/dL in women. The association between sUA concentration and SBP and DBP was examined using Pearson's correlation test, multivariate linear regression, and logistic regression analysis.The prevalence of hypertension and HUA increased with age (P < .001). Hypertension was more common in participants that had HUA than in those that did not (38.95% vs 30.16%, P = .02). Higher sUA was significantly associated with higher SBP and DBP in the 41- to 50-year-old participants (SBP, β = 0.35, P < .001; DBP, β = .29, P < .001; after adjustment for age, sex, total cholesterol, estimated glomerular filtration rate, and fasting plasma glucose). HUA was also a risk factor for hypertension in this age group (odds ratio 1.425, 95% confidence interval, 1.217-1.668, P < .001). There was no association between sUA concentration and SBP and DBP in the other age groups.In this population of healthy Chinese participants, sUA concentration was positively associated with hypertension only in the 41- to 50-year-old group. Lowering uric acid in this age group may help to reduce the incidence of hypertension.",

In Italy, prevalence is around 12% of the general population and increases in renal disease up to 60%. Recent experimental studies demonstrated a role of uric acid in the development of arterial hypertension and systemic arteriosclerosis, with an increase in cardiovascular risk. It also appears from observational studies that high uric acid is an independent risk factor associated with de novo onset of chronic kidney disease after adjustment of main confounding variables. Hyperuricemic subjects treated with febuxostat, a selective inhibitor of xantino-oxidase, showed in RCTs a better control of hyperuricaemia in comparison with those receiving allopurinol. Moreover, observational studies indicate that urate lowering treatment could be helpful in reducing cardiovascular events as well as in slowing the progression of chronic kidney disease; randomized controlled studies, designed to assess as primary outcome the nephroprotective effect of urate lowering treatment, are in progress.",

Most guidelines recommend against utilisation of probenecid therapy in patients with GFR <50, but there is no obvious contraindication to its use, provided renal calculi do not develop. Our case illustrates the synergistic effect probenecid can add to maximal xanthine oxidase inhibitor therapy for patients with refractory hyperuricaemia in a patient with CKD stage IIIb.

We attempted to examine the uric acid-lowering effect and the renoprotective effect of topiroxostat, a selective xanthine oxidoreductase inhibitor, in patients with diabetic nephropathy and hyperuricemia in this pilot study.\nMETHODS: The study design was randomized, double-blind, placebo-controlled, parallel-group study. A total of 65 patients with hyperuricemia and diabetic nephropathy with microalbuminuria were enrolled and assigned to either the topiroxostat group or the placebo group. Topiroxostat (stepwise dosing from 40 to 160 mg\/day) or matching placebo was administered BID for 28 weeks. The primary endpoint was a change in the urinary albumin-to-creatinine ratio in the first-morning-void urine sample. Secondary endpoints were changes in the estimated glomerular filtration rate and the serum uric acid level.\nRESULTS: At 28 weeks, there was no significant difference in the percent change from baseline in the urinary albumin-to-creatinine ratio between the two groups (topiroxostat: 0 vs. placebo: 17%, p = 0.3206), but the changes in the estimated glomerular filtration rate (- 0.2 vs. - 4.0 mL\/min\/1.73 m, p = 0.0303) and the serum uric acid level (- 2.94 vs. - 0.20 mg\/dL, p < 0.0001) were significantly different between the topiroxostat and placebo groups. Gouty arthritis occurred in 1 patient in the placebo group and no patients in the topiroxostat group.\nCONCLUSION: These findings support that diabetic nephropathy combined with hyperuricemia may be associated with kidney dysfunctions. Topiroxostat provides strict control of the serum uric acid level preventing decline of eGFR in these patients.",

A clinical trial was executed to measure the preventive effect of allopurinol against CIN in high-risk patients undertaking coronary angiography.\nMETHODS: Through randomized controlled trial, 140 patients with at minimum two risk factors of CIN, undertaking coronary angiography, were randomly allocated to the allopurinol (n = 70) or control group (n = 70). Those in the allopurinol group received allopurinol (300 mg) a day before their coronary angiography and intravenous hydration for 12 hours before and after their procedure, while members of the control group only received intravenous hydration. Serum creatinine (SCr), blood urea nitrogen (BUN) and uric acid were measured before and 48 hours after the procedure. CIN was defined by a 25% increase in SCr or the concentration of > 0.5 mg\/dl, 48 hours after coronary angiography.\nRESULTS: CIN was observed in 8 (11.4%) patients in the allopurinol group and 11 (15.7%) patients in the control group. There was no significant difference in the incidence of CIN between the two groups at 48 hours after coronary angiography (P = 0.459). In the allopurinol group, the median SCr concentration decreased non-significantly from 1.16 mg\/dl to 1.13 mg\/dl, 48 hours after coronary angiography (P = 0.189). In the control group, the median SCr concentration increased significantly from 1.11 mg\/dl to 1.2 mg\/dl, 48 hours after coronary angiography (P < 0.001).\nCONCLUSION: Allopurinol presents no considerable effectiveness over the hydration protocol for development of CIN in high-risk patients.",

        "Abstract":"Gout is an inflammatory disease manifested by the deposition of monosodium urate (MSU) crystals in joints, cartilage, synovial bursa, tendons or soft tissues. Gout is not a new disease, which was first documented nearly 5,000 years ago. The prevalence of gout has increased globally in recent years, imposing great disease burden worldwide. Moreover, gout or hyperuricemia is clearly associated with a variety of comorbidities, including cardiovascular diseases, chronic kidney disease, urolithiasis, metabolic syndrome, diabetes mellitus, thyroid dysfunction, and psoriasis. To prevent acute arthritis attacks and complications, earlier use of pharmacotherapeutic treatment should be considered, and patients with hyperuricemia and previous episodes of acute gouty arthritis should receive long-term urate-lowering treatment. Urate-lowering drugs should be used during the inter-critical and chronic stages to prevent recurrent gout attacks, which may elicit gradual resolution of tophi. The goal of urate-lowering therapy should aim to maintain serum uric acid (sUA) level <6.0 mg\/dL. For patients with tophi, the initial goal can be set at lowering sUA to <5.0 mg\/dL to promote tophi dissolution. The goal of this consensus paper was to improve gout and hyperuricemia management at a more comprehensive level. The content of this consensus paper was developed based on local epidemiology and current clinical practice, as well as consensuses from two multidisciplinary meetings and recommendations from Taiwan Guideline for the Management of Gout and Hyperuricemia.",

The original study aims to verify the positive effects of the traditional Chinese medicinal formula Shizhifang (SZF) on ameliorating the hyperuricemia, tubular injury, and inflammasome infiltration in the kidneys of hyperuricemic lab rats.\nMETHOD: Twenty-eight male Sprague-Dawley rats were divided into four groups: control group, oxonic acid potassium (OA) model group, OA + SZF group, and OA + Allopurinol group. We evaluated the mediating effects of SZF on renal mitochondrial reactive oxygen species (ROS) and oxidative stress (OS) products, protein expression of NLRP3-ASC-caspase-1 axis, and downstream inflammatory factors IL-1 and IL-18 after 7 weeks of animals feeding.\nRESULT: SZF alleviated OA-induced hyperuricemia and inhibited OS in hyperuricemic rats ( < 0.05). SZF effectively suppressed the expression of gene and protein of the NLRP3-ASC-caspase-1 axis through accommodating the ROS-TXNIP pathway ( < 0.05).\nCONCLUSION: Our data suggest that SZF alleviates renal tubular injury and inflammation infiltration by inhibiting NLRP3 inflammasome activation triggered by mitochondrial ROS in the kidneys of hyperuricemic lab rats.",

Clinical data of 6 814 patients with gout from 100 hospitals in 27 provinces, municipalities or autonomous regions in China were collected and analyzed.  (1) The ratio of male to female in patients with gout was 14.7∶1. The mean age of onset was (48.8±15.1) years old. Mean serum urate level was (526.7±132.3) μmol\/L. Patients' education background was of U-shaped distribution; (2) Hypertension was the most common comorbidity [15.8%(1 079\/6 814)], then overweight or obesity [51.9%(3 536\/6 814)]; (3) Alcohol and high-purine food intake were dominant triggering factors in men. The diagnosis of gout was made after onset in majority of patients with cardinal symptom arthralgia. Most patients had the disease less than 5 years, and the longer the course, the more flares in the previous year of entry; (4) Febuxostat was the mostly used urate-lowering medication. 20.7%(1 412\/6 814), 10.8%(739\/6 814) and 3.9%(265\/6 814) of patients were followed up in 4 weeks, 12 weeks and 24 weeks after registration, and 18.9%(267\/1 412), 29.1%(215\/739) and 38.1%(101\/265) of them reached the control target of serum urate levels, respectively. After treatment, patients' liver function was not affected, but serum creatinine levels decreased significantly.  The proportion of gout patients who reach target serum urate level is very low.

        "Abstract":"BACKGROUND: Metabolic syndrome and obesity are linked with hyperuricemia, and it has also been proposed that oxidative stress associated with hyperuricemia may promote benign prostatic hyperplasia (BPH). However, it is currently unknown whether use of antihyperuricemic medication is associated with risk of developing BPH. We studied the association between BPH and use of antihyperuricemic allopurinol in a Finnish population-based cohort.\nMETHODS: The study cohort consisted of 74,754 men originally identified for the Finnish Randomized Study of Screening for Prostate Cancer (FinRSPC). Information on gout and BPH medication usage (5α-reductase inhibitors, 5ARIs) during 1996-2014 was obtained from the National medication reimbursement database. Information on BPH diagnoses from in- and outpatient hospital visits and BPH-related surgery was obtained from the National Health Care Registry. Men with a record of BPH at baseline was excluded. We used Cox regression to analyze risk of starting BPH medication, having a recorded diagnosis or undergoing BPH surgery by allopurinol use with adjustment for age and simultaneous use of statins, antidiabetic or antihypertensive drugs and aspirin or other NSAIDs. Medication use was analyzed as a time-dependent variable to minimize immortal time bias.\nRESULTS: Men using allopurinol had a decreased risk for all three BPH endpoints: BPH medication (HR 0.81; 95% CI 0.75-0.88), BPH diagnosis (HR 0.78; 95% CI 0.71-0.86) and BPH-related surgery (HR 0.67; 95% CI 0.58-0.76) after multivariable adjustment. The risk association did not change by cumulative use. The risk decrease disappeared after 1-2 years lag time. Only BMI modified the risk association; the risk decrease was observed only among men with BMI above the median (27.3 kg\/m); p for interaction <0.05 for each endpoint.\nCONCLUSIONS: We found that allopurinol use is associated with lowered risk of BPH medication, diagnosis and surgery. A possible explanation could be antioxidative effects of urate-lowering allopurinol.",

T2T has been proposed for rheumatic diseases such as RA, spondyloarthritis, lupus, and recently for gout. The level of evidence for such approaches differs from one condition to the other (moderate to high for hyperlipidaemia, for example). Practice is based on the best available evidence at any time, and in absence of good evidence for T2T in gout, some suggest a conservative only-treat-symptoms approach. Evidence suggests that not treating gout to target in the long term is overall associated with worsening outcomes, such as flares, tophi and structural damage, which is associated to loss of quality of life and mortality. Different targets have been proposed for hyperuricaemia in gout; lower than 6 mg\/dl (0.36 mmol\/l) for all patients, at least <5 mg\/dl (0.30 mmol\/l) for patients with severe-polyarticular or tophaceous-gout.",

However, some patients with gout show failure to achieve the predefined target of 5-6 mg\/dl with xanthine oxidase inhibitors alone, so alternative drugs are needed. The aim of this study was to review studies of novel drugs targeting uric acid transporter 1 (URAT1) and\/or other urate transporters for the management of gout.\nMETHODS: MeSH terms were used to identify phase 2\/3 trials assessing the efficacy of novel uricosurics. A narrative review of novel drugs targeting URAT1 and\/or other urate transporters for the management of gout is provided.\nRESULTS: Lesinurad is a recently approved uricosuric that inhibits URAT1 and the organic ion transporter organic anion transporter 4 (OAT4). Phase 3 trials showed that lesinurad, combined with allopurinol or febuxostat, is a potent urate-lowering therapeutic with an acceptable safety profile. Arhalofenate, another emerging uricosuric, also interacts with URAT1 and organic anion transporter 4. Phase 2 trials suggested that it can both lower serum UA levels and reduce the risk of flares.\nCONCLUSIONS: New drugs inhibiting URAT1 should cover the unmet need for patients with failure to respond or with contraindications to xanthine oxidase inhibitors.",

        "Abstract":"Patients with gout often have co-morbidities such as cardiovascular disease, renal failure and metabolic syndrome components. Some studies, but not all, have suggested that hyperuricaemia and gout are associated with increased risk of myocardial infarction, renal failure and death primarily because of increased risk of cardiovascular events. Therefore, knowledge of the effects of urate-lowering therapy (ULT) on co-morbidities, in particular cardiovascular events and chronic kidney disease, is crucial. Randomized controlled trials (RCTs) have suggested that allopurinol, a xanthine oxidase inhibitor, could improve exercise capacity in patients with chronic stable angina and could decrease blood pressure in adolescents. In contrast, a well-designed RCT found no effect of allopurinol in patients with heart failure. The impact of ULT in patients with chronic kidney disease is unclear. Some RCTs found that allopurinol could slow the decline in kidney function, whereas a recent controlled trial found no benefit of febuxostat. Large randomized placebo-controlled trials are warranted to confirm or not the benefit of ULT on co-morbidities.",

        "Published":"2017-12-21",
        "Abstract":"BACKGROUND: The use of allopurinol in people with chronic kidney disease (CKD) remains one of the most controversial areas in gout management. The aim of this study was to determine the effect of baseline kidney function on safety and efficacy of allopurinol dose escalation to achieve serum urate (SU) <6 mg\/dl.\nMETHODS: We undertook a post hoc analysis of a 24-month allopurinol dose escalation treat-to-target SU randomized controlled trial, in which 183 people with gout were randomized to continue current dose allopurinol for 12 months and then enter the dose escalation phase or to begin allopurinol dose escalation immediately. Allopurinol was increased monthly until SU was <6 mg\/dl. The effect of baseline kidney function on urate lowering and adverse effects was investigated.\nRESULTS: Irrespective of randomization, there was no difference in the percentage of those with creatinine clearance (CrCL) <30 ml\/min who achieved SU <6 mg\/dl at the final visit compared to those with CrCL ≥30 to <60 ml\/min and those with CrCL ≥60 ml\/min, with percentages of 64.3% vs. 76.4% vs. 75.0%, respectively (p = 0.65). The mean allopurinol dose at month 24 was significantly lower in those with CrCL <30 ml\/min as compared to those with CrCL ≥30 to <60 ml\/min or CrCL ≥60 ml\/min (mean (SD) 250 (43), 365 (22), and 460 (19) mg\/day, respectively (p < 0.001)). Adverse events were similar among groups.\nCONCLUSIONS: Allopurinol is effective at lowering urate even though and accepting that there were small numbers of participants with CrCL <30 ml\/min, these data indicate that allopurinol dose escalation to target SU is safe in people with severe CKD. The dose required to achieve target urate is higher in those with better kidney function.\nTRIAL REGISTRATION: Australian and New Zealand Clinical trials Registry, ACTRN12611000845932 .

        "Abstract":"INTRODUCTION: Hyperuricemia (chronically elevated serum uric acid) is the main pathology underlying the development of gout, the most common inflammatory arthropathy. Management of these conditions therefore relies on controlling serum uric acid levels. ATP-binding cassette transporter, sub-family G, member 2 (ABCG2\/BCRP) is a well-studied urate transporter expressed on apical membranes in several tissues, including the intestine, liver, and kidney. Here, we discuss the potential of future gout therapies targeting ABCG2. Areas covered: ABCG2 regulates serum uric acid via physiologically important roles in both renal and extra-renal urate excretion. ABCG2 dysfunction, which promotes onset of hyperuricemia, often results in decreased urate excretion through the extra-renal (principally intestinal), rather than the renal pathway. This review covers recent attempts to establish the basis of ABCG2 function according to genetic diathesis, its molecular structure, and the effects of medication. Furthermore, the possibility of treating gout and hyperuricemia by upregulating intestinal ABCG2 expression is examined. Expert opinion: ABCG2 holds great promise as a therapeutic target for these conditions, particularly considering its involvement in extra-renal urate excretion. Manipulation of ABCG2, including controlling the level and location of its expression, has the potential to prevent gout by promoting uric acid excretion as effectively as general uricosuric drugs.\nABBREVIATIONS: ATP-binding cassette (ABC), transmembrane domain (TMD), nucleotide binding domain (NBD), single nucleotide polymorphism (SNP), single nucleotide polymorphisms (SNPs).",

        "Abstract":"PURPOSE OF REVIEW: To discuss recent studies of lesinurad and arhalofenate.\nRECENT FINDINGS: Lesinurad acts by blocking urate reabsorption channels URAT-1 and OAT-4. It has urate-lowering effect when used alone and in combination with xanthine oxidase inhibitors (XOIs). Its uricosuric activity depends on glomerular filtration, and its' efficacy is impaired at eGFR less than 30 ml\/min. Lesinurad monotherapy (400 mg\/day) associates with serum creatinine elevations. However, this risk is substantially attenuated with coprescription of a XOI and when prescribed at a dose of 200 mg\/day. Given its' modest urate-lowering effect, and the risk of serum creatinine elevation when used alone, it is licenced for use in combination with XOI for people unable to achieve target serum uric acid with XOI alone. Lesinurad does not have the drug interactions associated with probenecid, however, it is metabolized by CYP2C9, and should be used with caution if CYP2C9 inhibitors are coprescribed. Arhalofenate also acts by blocking URAT-1; however, it also blocks the NALP-3 inflammasome providing gout-specific anti-inflammatory effect. Arhalofenate has a weaker urate-lowering effect than lesinurad and further phase III evaluation is planned.\nSUMMARY: Lesinurad provides an additional option for people with gout unable to achieve target serum uric acid with XOI alone.",

        "Abstract":"OBJECTIVES: Febuxostat, a nonpurine xanthine oxidase, is known to be effective and safe, even in patients with chronic kidney disease. However, there are insufficient data about the efficacy and safety of febuxostat in kidney transplant patients.\nMATERIALS AND METHODS: We reviewed medical records of all kidney transplant patients who were prescribed febuxostat between August 2012 and May 2015 at Asan Medical Center in Seoul, Korea. The efficacy and safety results of febuxostat in transplant patients were evaluated. To compare the efficacy of febuxostat, results of kidney transplant patients who were prescribed benzbromarone or allopurinol for more than 1 year during the same period were also reviewed.\nRESULTS: Thirty-one patients were included in this study. The initial serum uric acid level of 481.83 ± 143.36 μmol\/L decreased to 302.18 ± 150.50 μmol\/L after 1 month of febuxostat use. Only 1 patient had altered sense of taste after taking febuxostat, but this symptom quickly improved and he continued treatment. No other adverse events were reported. In addition, at 12 months, mean serum uric acid levels were 280.77 ± 78.52 μmol\/L in the febuxostat, 332.52 ± 72.57 μmol\/L in the benzbromarone, and 363.45 ± 60.08 μmol\/L in the allopurinol group. However, we found no apparent effect on estimated glomerular filtration rate (P = .344). The mean doses of febuxostat, benzbromarone, and allopurinol were 52.31 ± 5.33 mg\/day, 42.19 ± 1.69 mg\/day, and 146.67 ± 16.52 mg\/day.\nCONCLUSIONS: Febuxostat reduced serum uric acid levels effectively in kidney transplant patients without severe adverse events.",

Puerarin possesses anti-inflammatory activity by affecting immunocyte, inflammation cytokines and signaling pathway. Puerarin also has anti-gout activity through inhibition of xanthine oxidase, promoting the excretion of uric acid to reduce serum uric acid level. Although its ability in reducing uric acid level was lower than that of allopurinol in clinical application, puerarin can also enhance the total antioxidant and free radical scavenging with stronger anti-inflammatory effect, so it will be a promising research direction to find new drugs with better anti-gout activity and less side effects by modifying the chemical structure of puerarin.",

        "Abstract":"ETHNOPHARMACOLOGY RELEVANCE: Dioscin, a spirostane glycoside, the rhizoma of Dioscorea septemloba (Diocoreacea) is used for diuresis, rheumatism, and joints pain. Given the poor solubility and stability of Dioscin, we proposed a hypothesis that Dioscin's metabolite(s) are the active substance(s) in vivo to contribute to the reducing effects on serum uric acid levels.\nAIM OF THE STUDY: The aim of this study is to identify the active metabolite(s) of Dioscin in vivo and to explore the mechanism of its antihyperuricemic activity.\nMATERIALS AND METHODS: After oral administration of Dioscin in potassium oxonate (PO) induced hyperuricemia rats and adenine-PO induced hyperuricemia mice models, serum uric acid and creatinine levels, clearance of uric acid and creatinine, fractional excretion of uric acid, and renal pathological lesions were determined were used to evaluate the antihyperuricemic effects. Renal glucose transporter-9 (GLUT-9) and organic anion transporter-1 (OAT-1) expressions were analyzed by western blotting method. Renal uric acid excretion was evaluated using stably urate transporter-1 (URAT-1) transfected human epithelial kidney cell line. Intestinal uric acid excretion was evaluated by measuring the transcellular transport of uric acid in HCT116 cells.\nRESULTS: In hyperuricemia rats, both 25 and 50mg\/kg of oral Dioscin decreased serum uric acid levels over 4h. In the hyperuricemia mice, two weeks treatment of Dioscin significantly decreased serum uric acid and creatinine levels, increased clearance of uric acid and creatinine, increased fractional excretion of uric acid, and reduced renal pathological lesions caused by hyperuricemia. In addition, renal GLUT -9 was significantly down-regulated and OAT-1 was up-regulated in Dioscin treated hyperuricemia mice. Dioscin's metabolite Tigogenin significantly inhibited uric acid re-absorption via URAT1 from 10 to 100μM. Diosgenin and Tigogenin increased uric acid excretion via ATP binding cassette subfamily G member 2 (ABCG2).\nCONCLUSION: Decreasing effect of Dioscin on serum uric acid level and enhancing effect on urate excretion were confirmed in hyperuricemia animal models. Tigogenin, a metabolite of Dioscin, was identified as an active substance with antihyperuricemic activity in vivo, through inhibition of URAT1 and promotion of ABCG2.",

        "Abstract":"INTRODUCTION: Topiroxostat, a recently developed xanthine oxidase inhibitor, is expected to have fewer adverse effects than allopurinol because it has different mechanism of action from alloprinol. However, its dosage, usage and safety have not been established in patients with impaired renal function or those undergoing dialysis at the development since no studies was conducted in these patients.\nMETHODS: Cross over clinical trial using 3 months of allopurinol and topiroxostat on 27 maintain Japanese HD patients were carried out. The effects on oxidative stress status of both drugs were also evaluated by measuring oxidation reduction potential.\nFINDINGS: Twenty-five of twenty-seven patients completed study. The mean serum uric acid levels in the topiroxostat-treated arm was significantly lower than it in the allopurinol-treated arm time-dependently (P < 0.0001). Corrected oxidative stress ratio defined as biological antioxidant potential\/diacron reactive oxygen metabolites was significantly increased in topiroxostat-arm (*P = 0.0035), but not in allopurinol-arm (P = 0.1429). No significant difference was seen in diacron reactive oxygen metabolites, biological antioxidant potential, static oxidation-reduction potential, and capacity oxidation-reduction potential between pre and post treatment of both drugs.\nDISCUSSION: It is suggested that a low dose of topiroxostat decreased serum uric acid sufficiently to maintain it below 7.0 mg\/dL in patients receiving hemodialysis.",

        "Abstract":"Gout is common in the elderly, affecting an estimated 4.7 million people aged > 60 years in the USA alone. The incidence and prevalence of gout increases, and male predisposition to gout reduces, with increasing age. The elderly have more comorbidities, and gout manifests differently, with more frequent involvement of knees, ankles, and wrists at disease onset, systemic upset, and tophi. Comorbidities and polypharmacy make the management of gout flares challenging in this population. Intra-articular corticosteroid injection remains the treatment of choice for accessible joints, oral prednisolone is preferred over low-dose colchicine, and non-steroidal anti-inflammatory drugs (NSAIDs) are best avoided. Xanthine oxidase inhibitors (XOI) remain the first-line treatment for hyperuricemia in the elderly. Arhalofenate, an emerging uricosuric anti-inflammatory drug, prevents gout flares while reducing serum urate. It may be particularly relevant in the treatment of gout in the elderly as they are unable to tolerate long-term colchicine for flare prophylaxis and frequently have contraindications to corticosteroids and NSAIDs. However, given its modest urate-lowering effect, it can only be used in combination with an XOI, and the safety and efficacy of this drug has not been examined in the elderly or in those with chronic kidney disease. Diuretics and beta-blockers should be discontinued where feasible, whereas low-dose aspirin can be continued if otherwise indicated.",

        "Abstract":"BACKGROUND: Urate-lowering therapy (ULT) is associated with low rates of adherence, leading to a potential risk of relapse of gouty arthritis, tophi, or urolithiasis. Our main aim was to identify the recurrence of gouty arthritis, tophi, or urolithiasis after discontinuation of ULT. Secondary aims included an assessment of ULT reintroduction rates and factors associated with relapse.\nMETHODS: We conducted a systematic literature review of clinical studies investigating the effect of discontinuing any ULT (allopurinol, febuxostat, probenecid, sulfinpyrazone, benzbromarone) in adults on long-term therapy. We searched The Cochrane Central Register of Controlled Trials, MEDLINE, EMBASE, Science Citation Index, and ClinicalTrials.gov from inception to March 2016. Conference abstracts of the ACR\/ARHP and EULAR annual conferences were hand-searched. Study quality was assessed using the first eight items of the methodological index for non-randomized studies (MINORS) tool. The review protocol is registered with PROSPERO (CRD42016042048).\nRESULTS: A total of 4640 articles were identified, eight of which were ultimately included. Most of these studies predated 2000. MINORS scores ranged from 5 to 10 out of a possible 16. Mean follow-up duration after discontinuation ranged from 12 to 96 months. Five studies focused on discontinuation of ULT in gouty arthritis and tophi, two in urolithiasis, and one in asymptomatic hyperuricemia. Relapse rates were high in gout (36-81%) and lower in urolithiasis (15%). Relapses occurred 1-4.5 years after ULT discontinuation. In one study, a low serum urate level before and after ULT discontinuation was associated with lower gout recurrence.\nDISCUSSION: Relapse of gout is common although delayed after discontinuation of ULT. Short-term prognosis after ULT discontinuation appears favorable if the serum urate level was low before ULT discontinuation. The results of this review are limited by the paucity of existing studies and their low quality. Further comparative studies should consider larger primary care populations and discontinuation of febuxostat.",

A total of 874 patients with hyperuricemia who were newly treated with allopurinol, febuxostat or benzbromarone were included. The primary and secondary outcomes were incident end-stage renal disease (ESRD) and the serum uric acid (SUA) changes from baseline, respectively. The results were analyzed using multiple Cox proportional models adjusted for multinomial propensity scores. For subgroup analyses, we further stratified patients according to whether their latest SUA level reached the therapeutic target.\nRESULTS: Compared with allopurinol, benzbromarone therapy was associated with a reduced risk of progression to dialysis, the adjusted hazard ratio was 0.50 (95% confidence interval, 0.25-0.99). Patients who received allopurinol or febuxostat exhibited a comparable risk of ESRD [adjusted hazard ratio, 0.99 (0.40-2.44)]. Febuxostat was significantly more potent than allopurinol or benzbromarone in lowering SUA levels in the fully adjusted model. Among patients who reached the therapeutic target, those with febuxostat and benzbromarone initiation had a significantly lower risk of ESRD.\nCONCLUSIONS: In conclusion, compared with conventional allopurinol, febuxostat and benzbromarone may be more effective in reducing the risk of progression to dialysis and in lowering SUA levels in CKD populations.",

Meta-analysis was performed using an inverse variance-weighted, random-effects model with standardized mean difference (SMD) as the effect size estimate.\nRESULTS: Meta-analysis of data from the ten eligible randomized controlled trials (RCTs), with 670 subjects, suggested a significant increase in FMD following allopurinol treatment (weighted mean difference [WMD] 1.79%, 95% confidence interval [CI] 1.01-2.56, p < 0.001; I : 86.77%). The effect size was robust and remained significant after omission of each single study. Subgroup analyses of RCTs based on the administered dose or duration of treatment did not reveal any significant impact of these variables on FMD change. Nor was a significant association found between allopurinol-induced changes in SUA levels and FMD (slope 0.46, p = 0.253), whereas baseline FMD significantly influenced the degree of FMD improvement following allopurinol treatment (slope 0.52, p = 0.022).

        "Abstract":"Though efficacious and affordable treatments for gout are widely available, gout is still not well controlled in many countries of the world including China.To investigate patient adherence to gout management recommendations and potential barriers in Chinese male gout patients, a survey was carried out by telephone interview in male patients registered in the gout clinic at Peking Union Medical College Hospital. Adherence to dietary and medication recommendations was measured by a food frequency questionnaire and proportion of cumulative time adherent to chemical urate-lowering therapy (ULT), respectively. Dietary adherence was defined as consumption of alcohol, seafood and animal organs less than once per month, and reduced red meat after dietary counseling. Medication adherence was defined as ULT ≥80% of time in the past 12 months for patients with indications. Logistic regression models were used to identify patient characteristics associated with management adherence. Reasons for nonadherence were also sought by open-end questions.Dietary and medication adherence were 44.2% and 21.9%, respectively. Older age (odds ratio [OR] 7.90, 95% confidence interval [CI] 2.49-25.04 for age ≥60), higher serum uric acid (sUA) levels (OR 3.53, 95% CI 1.42-8.75 for the highest quartile), and tophi (OR 2.31, 95% CI 1.12-4.77) were associated with dietary adherence independently, while tophi (OR 14.05, 95% CI 2.67-74.08) and chronic kidney disease (OR 16.66, 95% CI 2.63-105.37) were associated with medication adherence independently. Reasons that patients reported for nonadherence to medication included remission after treatment (35.3%), concerns for potential side effects (22.7%), insufficient patient education (8.7%), and adverse events (8.2%).Patient adherence to gout management recommendations is poor in China. Older age, increased disease burden, and specific comorbidities were associated with management adherence.",

        "Abstract":"BACKGROUND: Diabetic ketoacidosis (DKA) in children less than 1 year of age is a rare occurrence. Typical presentation includes a prodrome of weight loss and polyuria with subsequent presentation to medical care when acidosis becomes symptomatic.\nCASE PRESENTATION: We describe an unusual case of a previously healthy infant with a 3 days' history of constipation, presenting acutely with abdominal pain, lethargy, and dehydration. On initial evaluation, our patient had profound encephalopathy, with marked tachypnea and work of breathing. Arterial blood gas revealed a pH of 6.9, pCO2 of 20 and a bicarbonate level of <5. There was profound leukocytosis (WBC 77 K\/μL), hyperuricemia (uric acid 15.9 mg\/dL), and evidence of pre-renal azotemia [blood urea nitrogen (BUN) 54, Cr 0.82]. Blood glucose was >700 mg\/dL. Despite fluid resuscitation and insulin infusion of 0.1 unit\/kg\/h, which are the mainstays of therapy for DKA, her severe metabolic acidosis and altered mental status did not improve. Differential diagnosis for her metabolic derangements included inborn errors of metabolism, insulin receptor defects, toxic ingestions, and septic shock secondary to an underlying oncologic or intra-abdominal process. The patient was treated with broad spectrum antibiotics and rasburicase. She continued to have significant shock for the first 30 h of her hospital stay, requiring moderate vasoactive support. Due to her refractory acidosis and persistent hyperglycemia, insulin infusion was increased to 0.15 units\/kg\/h. A hemoglobin A1C obtained on the second hospital day revealed a level of 7.4 and helped to solidify the diagnosis.\nCONCLUSIONS: Metabolic acidosis in an infant requires a broad differential. Rasburicase should be considered in hyperuricemia and DKA.",

        "Abstract":"The aim of this review was to summarize the evidence for combination therapy to achieve serum urate (SUA) target levels in gout. Within this overarching aim, a second aim was to evaluate the evidence for a new uricosuric agent lesinurad, which inhibits urate transport in the kidney. In summary, this review indicates that there are a number of ways to approach patients who do not achieve a target serum urate with allopurinol (APL) monotherapy. These include higher doses of APL up to 600-800 mg\/d, switching to febuxostat, or adding in a uricosuric. For the latter option, controlled supporting evidence is available for benzbromarone, probenecid, and lesinurad. All options appear similar in terms of success rates, so the choice of option comes down to physician and patient choice, cost, experience, and strength of the evidence base. Increasing the dose of APL is the cheapest option, while febuxostat is consistently superior to standard doses of APL. The strongest evidence for the uricosuric option is available for lesinurad as trials of other agents are either nonexistent or based on small single-centre trials. It is suggested that guidelines should be expanded to consider all of these evidence-based options in the not-uncommon occurrence of APL inadequate response.",

        "Abstract":"Gout is a common form of inflammatory arthritis caused by deposition of monosodium urate crystals. The central strategy for effective long-term management of gout is serum urate lowering. Current urate-lowering drugs include both xanthine oxidase inhibitors and uricosuric agents. Lesinurad is a URAT1 inhibitor that selectively inhibits urate rebsorption at the proximal renal tubule. Lesinurad 200mg daily in combination with a xanthine oxidase is approved for urate-lowering therapy in patients with gout. Areas covered: The published literature was searched using Pubmed and additional information was obtained from publically available regulatory documents. Pre-clinical data and clinical trials of lesinurad are described. Serum urate-lowering efficacy and effects on other clinical endpoints are discussed. Adverse event data, focusing on renal safety are also presented. Expert opinion: Lesinurad is an effective urate-lowering drug that has a generally acceptable safety profile when used at 200mg daily dosing in combination with a xanthine oxidase inhibitor. The recent approval of fixed dose combination pills of lesinurad with allopurinol is an important step in improving adherence and reducing risk of renal adverse events. It remains to be seen if this therapy will provide additional benefit for gout management above improved use of widely available generic therapies.",

        "Abstract":"BACKGROUND: Hyperuricemia is associated with hypertension, with elevated serum uric acid levels postulated to have a causal role in the development of hypertension. Consequently, serum uric acid reduction may help lower blood pressure (BP). A Phase 2, double-blind, placebo-controlled trial was conducted to assess the potential BP-lowering effects of the xanthine oxidase inhibitor febuxostat in subjects with hypertension and hyperuricemia (serum uric acid ≥0.42 mmol\/L [≥7.0 mg\/dL]).\nMETHODS AND RESULTS: Subjects (n=121) were randomized 1:1 to febuxostat 80 mg once daily or to placebo. The primary end point was change from baseline to Week 6 in 24-hour mean ambulatory systolic BP (SBP). Additional end points included the following: change from baseline to Week 3 in 24-hour mean SBP and changes from baseline to Weeks 3 and 6 in 24-hour mean ambulatory diastolic BP, serum uric acid, mean daytime and nighttime ambulatory SBP\/diastolic BP, and clinic SBP\/diastolic BP. For the overall study population, there were no significant differences between febuxostat and placebo for changes from baseline to Weeks 3 or 6 in ambulatory, daytime or nighttime, or clinic SBP or diastolic BP. However, in a preplanned subgroup analysis, there was a significant decrease in SBP from baseline to Week 6 in subjects with normal renal function (estimated glomerular filtration rate ≥90 mL\/min) treated with febuxostat versus placebo; least squares mean difference, -6.7; 95% confidence interval -13.3 to -0.0; =0.049.\nCONCLUSIONS: This study suggests that febuxostat may lower BP in hyperuricemic patients with hypertension and normal renal function; further studies should be conducted to confirm this finding.\nCLINICAL TRIAL REGISTRATION: URL: http:\/\/www.clinicaltrials.gov.

        "Abstract":"OBJECTIVES: To determine whether febuxostat with stepwise dose increase is as useful as colchicine prophylaxis in reducing gout flares during the initial introduction of urate-lowering therapy in patients with gout in comparison with febuxostat with no dose titration.\nMETHODS: In this prospective, multicentre, randomised open-label comparative study, patients were randomised to group A (stepwise dose increase of febuxostat from 10 to 40 mg\/day), group B (fixed-dose febuxostat 40 mg\/day plus colchicine 0.5 mg\/day) or group C (fixed-dose febuxostat 40 mg\/day) and observed for 12 weeks. Gout flare was defined as non-steroidal anti-inflammatory drug use for gout symptoms.\nRESULTS: A total of 255 patients were randomised, and 241 patients were treated. Among the treated patients, gout flares were experienced by 20\/96 (20.8%) in group A, 18\/95 (18.9%) in group B and 18\/50 (36.0%) in group C. The incidence of flare was significantly lower in groups A and B than that in group C (P=0.047 and P=0.024, respectively), although the differences were not significant after correction for multiple comparisons. No significant difference was noted between the incidence of gout flare in groups A and B.\nCONCLUSIONS: Our data suggested that stepwise dose increase of febuxostat and low-dose colchicine prophylaxis effectively reduced gout flares in comparison with fixed-dose febuxostat alone. Stepwise dose increase of febuxostat may be an effective alternative to low-dose colchicine prophylaxis during the introduction of urate-lowering therapy.\nTRIAL REGISTRATION NUMBER: UMIN 000008414",

        "Abstract":"Although asymptomatic hyperuricemia is rather often in laboratory reports, it cannot be considered a disease. Despite the high prevalence of hyperuricemia in patients with arterial hypertension (AH), chronic kidney disease (CKD), cardiovascular disease (CVD) or metabolic syndrome, hyperuricemia is not confirmed as a causative factor of these disorders. The aim is to point to the latest studies of the importance of urate as a possible cardiorenal risk factor. The literature published in 2015 and 2016 was searched for the possible impact of urate level on the development of cardiorenal diseases. The PubMed, Cochrane, Medline, and UpToDate databases were searched for the literature published between November 2009 and October 2016 using the following key words: urate, hyperuricemia, cardiovascular disease, and chronic kidney disease. Causative correlation of hyperuricemia is confirmed only in disorders where deposits of monosodium urate crystals are present. Results of recent studies do not justify routine use of xanthine oxidase inhibitors in asymptomatic hyperuricemia. Some studies with small numbers of patients and short follow up report on endothelial function improvement on therapy with xanthine oxidase inhibitors. Nonpharmacological intervention by changing unhealthy lifestyle is preferred. Treatment of asymptomatic hyperuricemia in CKD is still debated, and additional studies are necessary to demonstrate the benefit of lowering urate level in CKD. Family doctors (general practitioners) should be familiar with the recommended approach to patients with asymptomatic hyperuricemia. Evidence based medicine still does not recommend target determination of serum urate level for identifying CVD and CKD risk factors. Recent studies suggest the possible effect of uric acid in cardiorenal diseases and that treatment of asymptomatic hyperuricemia with xanthine oxidase inhibitors may also be useful in CVD prevention. Additional studies are needed to prove this statement.",

HUVECs were divided into four groups: ddH O group, ddH O + MSU group, 1\/2 ddH O +1\/2 SHQ + MSU group, and SHQ + MSU group. The effects of SHQ on cell viability, concentration and expression of intercellular adhesion molecule-1 (ICAM-1), and MSU-induced release of interleukin (IL)-1β and IL-6 were investigated. Additionally, cell viability and ICAM-1 concentration and expression were detected after HUVECs were incubated with the culture supernatant of THP-1 cells that had been treated with phorbol 12-myristate 13-acetate (PMA), MSU and SHQ for 24 h.\nRESULTS: The viability of HUVECs was significantly decreased with increasing transfection concentrations of MSU, and MSU treatment resulted in a significant increase of the concentration and expression of ICAM-1. In addition, SHQ improved the MSU-induced decrease in cell viability and alleviated MSU-mediated increase in ICAM-1 levels. Moreover, SHQ decreased MSU-induced release of IL-1β and IL-6. After HUVECs were incubated with the culture supernatant of THP-1 cells that had been treated with PMA, MSU and SHQ for 24 h, SHQ also markedly alleviated the effects of MSU, such as by increasing cell viability and decreasing ICAM-1 levels.\nCONCLUSIONS: Drinking natural soda water may have a significant role in preventing gouty inflammation.",

Allopurinol has previously been shown to improve endothelial dysfunction, reduce oxidative stress burden, and improve myocardial efficiency. In this \"proof of concept\" study, we investigated the effect of allopurinol on exercise capacity, coronary and peripheral endothelial function, and serum B-type natriuretic peptide (BNP: a marker of cardiac function and myocardial ischemia) in patients with cardiac syndrome X.\nMETHODS AND RESULTS: This study was a randomized, double-blind, placebo-control crossover trial. Nineteen patients (mean age 59 ± 10 years, 11 women and 8 men) with cardiac syndrome X were randomized to a 6-week treatment with either allopurinol (600 mg\/day) or placebo. After 4 weeks of washout period, they were crossed over to the other arm. Outcomes measured at baseline and after treatment were maximum exercise time (ET) derived from Bruce protocol exercise treadmill test, serum BNP measurement, coronary flow reserve (CFR) as assessed by measuring the response of flow velocity in the left anterior descending artery to adenosine, and flow-mediated vasodilatation of the brachial artery (FMD). Allopurinol significantly reduced serum uric acid levels when compared with placebo (-48 ± 24% vs 1.9 ± 11%, P < .001). There was no significant difference in maximum ET, CFR, and FMD between allopurinol and placebo.

        "Abstract":"Several epidemiological studies have demonstrated the existence of a correlation between high serum uric acid (SUA) levels, hypertension, and chronic kidney disease (CKD). Xantine oxidase inhibitors (XOI) are the most powerful uric acid lowering drugs, with presumed beneficial effects on cardiovascular and renal system. The multifactorial mechanism linking hyperuricemia with cardiovascular and renal diseases involves both the SUA level and the xanthine oxidase (XO) activity. In this context, the clinical research has been recently focused at assessing the efficacy of urate-lowering drugs active on XO in patients with abnormal blood pressure values and renal dysfunction. The mechanism of action responsible for the beneficial effect of XOI has not completely elucidated, and long-term studies involving large population samples are needed. In particular, XOI could play an important role in the management of hypertension and CKD, especially in patients not entirely controlled by conventional therapies. In the present review, we summarize the results of recent clinical trials that largely support a positive effect of allopurinol and febuxostat on blood pressure, glomerular filtration rate (GFR), and serum creatinine in different populations of patients. Will these drugs be considered a reliable choice or alternative to currently used drugs for the hypertension and kidney failure treatment?

        "Abstract":"BACKGROUND: Hyperuricemia is associated with the progression of chronic kidney disease (CKD), but it is not known whether the relationship is causal. We examined the association of hyperuricemia and uric acid lowering therapy (UALT) with progression of CKD in patients with CKD 3 and 4 in the Cleveland Clinic CKD registry.\nMETHODS: We included 1,676 patients with CKD stages 3 and 4 from Ohio, who had measured their uric acid (UA) levels a year prior to the recording of the second eGFR <60 mL\/min\/1.73 m2, and follow-up eGFR, between 2005 and 2009. Our primary composite outcome included a 50% drop in eGFR or progression to ESRD. Secondary outcomes included the rate of decline in eGFR, all-cause mortality, progression to ESRD, and a composite measure of progression to ESRD or death. We assessed the association between UA, UALT, and outcomes using Cox models and competing risks regression models.\nRESULTS: In multivariable models, higher UA was associated with the composite endpoint, but it reached statistical significance only in the 4th quartile (≥8.9 mg\/dL). Receipt of UALT was significantly associated with increased risk of the composite outcome. Neither UA nor UALT (considered a time-dependent covariate) was significantly associated with mortality. The inference was similar for UA as high vs. low, quartiles, or continuous. Similarly, neither high UA nor UALT were significantly associated with ESRD, the composite of ESRD and mortality, or eGFR decline.\nCONCLUSIONS: Hyperuricemia is associated with increased risk of progression to ESRD in patients with CKD stages 3 and 4, but UALT does not ameliorate the risk, suggesting that the relationship is not causal.",

        "Abstract":"OBJECTIVE: To investigate the efficacy and safety of lesinurad, a selective uric acid reabsorption inhibitor, in a 6 month, phase 3 clinical trial and extension study.\nMETHODS: Patients with gout who cannot take a xanthine oxidase inhibitor (XOI) and have serum uric acid (sUA) ⩾6.5 mg\/dl were randomized to receive oral lesinurad (400 mg daily) or placebo. The primary endpoint was the proportion of patients with sUA <6.0 mg\/dl at month 6. Safety assessments included treatment-emergent adverse events (TEAEs) and laboratory data. Patients who completed the study were eligible for an open-label, uncontrolled extension study of lesinurad 400 mg monotherapy.\nRESULTS: Patients (n = 214) were primarily white males (mean age 54.4 years; gout duration 11.2 years). Significantly more patients achieved the primary endpoint with lesinurad than placebo (29.9 vs 1.9%; P < 0.0001). Overall TEAE rates were higher with lesinurad (77.6 vs 65.4%); renal-related TEAEs (17.8%), renal-related serious TEAEs (4.7%) and serum creatinine elevations (1.5 times baseline, 24.3%) occurred only with lesinurad. A total of 143 patients (65 lesinurad, 78 placebo) enrolled in the extension study. Treatment with lesinurad 400 mg resulted in rapid and sustained sUA lowering that persisted for up to 18 months before the study was terminated prematurely. No new safety findings were observed in the extension.\nCONCLUSION: In patients with gout and intolerance\/contraindication to XOIs, lesinurad 400 mg monotherapy demonstrated superior sUA lowering compared with placebo, with sustained effects for up to 18 months. Due to a high incidence of serum creatinine elevations and renal-related adverse events, including serious adverse events with lesinurad 400 mg, lesinurad should not be used as monotherapy.\nTRIAL REGISTRATION: ClinicalTrials.gov (http:\/\/clinincaltrials.gov), NCT01508702.",

        "Abstract":"OBJECTIVE: Hyperuricemia leading to urate crystal formation in tissues represents the pathophysiological mechanism of gout. Guidelines recommend a therapeutic target of serum urate concentration (sUA) <6 mg\/dL, or even lower (≤5 mg\/dL) in patients with large deposits. We conducted an analysis with the aim to achieve additional insights into the urate-lowering efficacy of two xanthine oxidase inhibitors, allopurinol and febuxostat.\nPATIENTS AND METHODS: This was a pooled analysis of phase III trials on allopurinol and febuxostat, including 4101 patients with gout and hyperuricemia. The efficacy outcomes were: mean reduction of sUA concentration from baseline; number of patients with target sUA levels (<6.0 mg\/dL or ≤5 mgdL); time to reach target sUA levels.\nRESULTS: Three registrative, phase III, randomized, multicenter, placebo-controlled\/allopurinol-controlled trials assessing the efficacy of febuxostat, were included. The mean reduction of sUA concentration with any dose of febuxostat was higher (-2.92±2.87 mg\/dL; -27%), with respect to placebo- (-0.62±1.84 mg\/dL; -5%) and allopurinol-pooled groups (-2.41±2.20 mg\/dL; -24%). Moreover, febuxostat showed a higher probability to achieve the recommended target sUA concentration than allopurinol [odds ratio: 2.43 (95% CI: 2.119-2.789) and 4.05 (95% CI: 3.41-4.82) for sUA levels <6 mg\/dL and ≤5 mg\/dL, respectively]. Patients on any-dose febuxostat reached target sUA faster than allopurinol-treated patients (86.04±71.47 vs. 98.76±70.88 days and 52.08±49.97 vs. 90.42±68.03 days for reaching sUA levels <6 mg\/dL and ≤5 mg\/dL, respectively; p <0.001 for both comparisons).\nCONCLUSIONS: In patients with gout and hyperuricemia, febuxostat was significantly more effective and faster than allopurinol in obtaining the recommended target sUA levels, which were reached by a higher number of patients. Therefore, febuxostat was confirmed as an effective option for the treatment of hyperuricemia in gout.",

        "Abstract":"INTRODUCTION: Numerous observational studies have reported that serum urate concentration positively correlates with bone density and reduced risk of fractures. The aim of this study was to examine whether soluble urate directly influences bone remodelling.\nMETHODS: In laboratory studies, the in vitro effects of soluble urate were examined in osteoclast, osteoblast and osteocyte assays at a range of urate concentrations consistent with those typically observed in humans (up to 0.70 mmol\/L). The clinical relevance of the in vitro assay findings was assessed using serial procollagen-1 N-terminal propeptide (P1NP) and Month 12 bone density data from a randomised controlled trial of allopurinol dose escalation in people with gout.\nRESULTS: Addition of urate in the RAW264.7 cell osteoclastogenesis assay led to small increases in osteoclast formation (ANOVA p = 0.018), but no significant difference in bone resorption. No significant effects on osteoclast number or activity were observed in primary cell osteoclastogenesis or resorption assays. Addition of urate did not alter viability or function in MC3T3-E1 pre-osteoblast, primary human osteoblast, or MLO-Y4 osteocyte assays. In the clinical trial analysis, reducing serum urate over a 12 month period by allopurinol dose escalation did not lead to significant changes in P1NP or differences in bone mineral density.\nCONCLUSION: Addition of soluble urate at physiological concentrations does not influence bone remodelling in vitro. These data, together with clinical trial data showing no effect of urate-lowering on P1NP or bone density, do not support a direct role for urate in influencing bone remodelling.",

We aimed to design and synthesize a more potent hURAT1 based on the structure of Lesinurad (LU), which was reported to lower uric acid levels with IC50 value of hURAT1 (about 60μM).\nMETHODS: A cell model was conducted and characterized via Real-time qRCR and Western blot. We synthesized and identified a new midazole analogue of LU. Cells stably-expressing hURAT1 or human organic anion transporter 1 (hOAT1) were used in the [C] urate or 6-carboxyfluorescein (6-CF) uptake assays to test the activities of the newly synthesized compound. The uric acid lowering effects of LU and LUM and their effects on urea nitrogen and creatinine in potassium oxonate-induced hyperuricemic rats were analyzed.\nRESULTS: The [C] Urate uptake assay using hURAT1 stably transfected MDCK cells indicated that LUM was more potent than LU against hURAT1, with IC50 values of 3.22μM and 65.47μM, respectively. LU and LUM also effectively suppressed hOAT1-mediated 6-CF uptake, and the IC50 hURAT1\/IC50 hOAT1 of LU and LUM was1.49 and 0.35 respectively, indicating a better selectivity for LUM than LU. In vivo, LUM-Na (40mg\/kg) showed more potent activity in reducing serum uric acid levels in potassium oxonate-induced hyperuricemic rats, compared to similar doses of LU-Na.\nCONCLUSION: LUM was demonstrated to be as potent a uricosuric drug as LU.",

Published articles and scientific posters relevant to the efficacy and safety of lesinurad were reviewed and summarized.\nDATA SYNTHESIS: Lesinurad was evaluated in 3 randomized, phase 3 clinical trials (CRYSTAL, CLEAR 1 and 2). The primary endpoint for CRYSTAL trial was the percentage of patients achieving serum uric acid (SUA) concentration ≤ 5 mg\/dL. The CLEAR 1 and 2 trials had a primary endpoint of percentage of patients achieving SUA concentration ≤ 6 mg\/dL. Lesinurad at either 200 or 400 mg\/d was superior to xanthine oxidase inhibitor (XOI) monotherapy in reducing the SUA concentration to 5 or 6 mg\/dL, when added to either allopurinol or febuxostat.\nCONCLUSION: Data from phase 3 clinical studies suggest the addition of lesinurad to allopurinol or febuxostat is superior to XOI monotherapy alone in reducing SUA concentrations while increasing the risk of renal-related adverse events. Lesinurad, 200 mg orally per day, would be a safe recommendation, in combination with an XOI, among patients with adequate renal function (i.e., above 45 mL\/min) who need additional therapy for inadequately controlled hyperuricemia associated with gout.",

Market authorization was granted in February 2016 in Europe and December 2015 in the USA. As a potentially nephrotoxic uricosuric drug acting on the kidney, nephrologists should become familiar with its indications and safety profile. The approved indication is treatment of gout in combination with a xanthine oxidase (XO) inhibitor in adult patients who have not achieved target serum uric acid levels with an XO inhibitor alone. It is not indicated for asymptomatic hyperuricaemia or for patients with estimated creatinine clearance <45 mL\/min. The only authorized daily dose is 200 mg and cannot be exceeded because of the nephrotoxicity risk. Nephrotoxicity is thought to be related to uricosuria. At the 200 mg\/day dose, serum creatinine more than doubled in 1.8% of lesinurad patients (versus 0% in placebo) and in 11% of these it was not reversible. In addition, it is subject to a risk management plan given the potential association with cardiovascular events. In randomized clinical trials, the association of lesinurad with either allopurinol or febuxostat achieved a greater reduction in serum uric acid (∼1 mg\/dL lower) than the XO inhibitors alone, and this allowed the serum uric acid target to be met in a higher proportion of patients, which was the primary endpoint.

Allopurinol, a uric acid lowering agent, protects renal progression. However, it is not widely used in patients with CKD because of its serious adverse event. Febuxostat can be alternatively used for patients who are intolerable to allopurinol. We aimed to determine renoprotective effect and urate-lowering effect between the two drugs.\nMETHODS: We performed a systematic review and meta-analysis of randomized controlled trials to assess the effects of febuxostat compared to allopurinol in patients with hyperuricemia. MEDLINE, Embase, and Cochrane Library databases were searched to identify research publications.\nRESULTS: Four relevant publications were selected from among 3,815 studies. No significant differences were found in the changes in serum creatinine from baseline between the febuxostat and allopurinol groups. Changes in estimated glomerular filtration rate (eGFR) were observed between the two groups at 1 month (mean difference 1.65 mL\/min\/1.73 m, 95% confidence interval [CI] 0.38, 2.91 mL\/min\/1.73 m; heterogeneity χ = 1.25, I = 0%,  = 0.01); however, the changes in eGFR were not significantly different at 3 months. A significant difference did exist in the changes in albuminuria levels from baseline between the febuxostat and allopurinol groups (mean difference -80.47 mg\/gCr, 95% CI -149.29, -11.64 mg\/gCr; heterogeneity χ = 0.81, I = 0%,  = 0.02). A significant difference was also observed in the changes in serum uric acid from baseline between the febuxostat and allopurinol groups (mean difference -0.92 mg\/dL, 95% CI -1.29, -0.56 mg\/dL; heterogeneity χ = 6.24, I = 52%,  < 0.001).\nCONCLUSION: Febuxostat might be more renoprotective than allopurinol.",

        "Abstract":"AIMS: Dual-urate-lowering therapy (ULT) with xanthine oxidase inhibitor and uricosuric medications is a treatment option for severe gout. Uricosuric agents can cause hyperuricosuria, a risk factor for nephrolithiasis and acute uric acid nephropathy. The aims of the present study were to simulate the relationship between suboptimal drug adherence and efficacy, and to quantify the risk of hyperuricosuria in gout patients receiving mono- and dual-ULTs.\nMETHODS: The impact of poor medication adherence was studied using two-compartment pharmacokinetic (PK) models based on published evidence, and a semi-mechanistic four-compartment pharmacodynamic (PD) model. The PKPD model was used to simulate mono and dual-ULT in gout patients with either under-excretion (lowered clearance) or overproduction of uric acid, with suboptimal adherence modelled as either a single drug holiday of increasing duration or doses taken at random.\nRESULTS: Simulation results showed a surge in urinary uric acid occurring when dosing is restarted following missed doses. For under-excreters taking a 20-day drug holiday, the addition of 200 mg (or 400 mg) lesinurad to 80 mg febuxostat increased the percentage of patients experiencing hyperuricosuria from 0% to 1.4% (or 3.1%). In overproducers, restarting ULTs following drug holidays of more than 5 days leads to over 60% of patients experiencing hyperuricosuria.\nCONCLUSIONS: Suboptimal medication adherence may compromise the safety and efficacy of mono- and dual-ULTs, especially in patients with gout resulting from an overproduction of uric acid. Clinicians and pharmacists should consider counselling patients with respect to the risks associated with partial adherence, and offer interventions to improve adherence or tailor treatments, where appropriate.",

        "Abstract":"Rasburicase is a novel drug used during the management of tumor lysis syndrome. In countries with limited resources, it is frequently given at a lower dose and only for the treatment of established tumor lysis syndrome and not as prophylaxis. A retrospective study was conducted in the department of pediatric oncology at a tertiary referral oncology center in south India to analyze the use of rasburicase over the past 3 years. Data of all the 18 children (< 14 years of age) who were given rasburicase for the management of hyperuricemia were collected and analyzed. With a mean rasburicase dose of 0.085 mg\/kg, hyperuricemia was managed efficiently without the need for a hemodialysis in 16 children (88.8 %). The fall in mean serum uric acid levels after the administration of a single dose of rasburicase at 4, 24, and 48 hours was 31.18 %, 64.8 %, and 74.5 %, respectively. Rasburicase efficiently decreases the uric acid levels to a normal level within a short period. In resource-limited settings, rasburicase at a lower dose is a promising option for managing hyperuricemia in the event of a tumor lysis syndrome.",

        "Abstract":"To determine the response of hemodialysis (HD) patients to topiroxostat after a switch from febuxostat, we evaluated the efficacy, tolerability, and serum concentration of topiroxostat in HD patients after the switch. In this 16-month prospective observational study, we assessed the serum uric acid (UA) levels, other laboratory data, and serum topiroxostat concentrations of 10 HD patients who had been receiving febuxostat at a dose of 10 mg\/d for over 1 year. No statistical difference was observed between the tolerability index at baseline and 16 months after the switch to topiroxostat. Serum UA after the switch in all patients (attained serum UA levels of ≤6 mg\/dL) was 5.6±1.7 mg\/dL (60%) at baseline, 4.9±0.5 mg\/dL (100%) at 6 months and 5.7±0.4 mg\/dL (50%) at 16 months (p=0.25), respectively. In patients with baseline serum UA levels >6 mg\/dL, serum UA was significantly reduced at 6 and 16 months compared with baseline. Minimum serum concentrations of serum topiroxostat were lower than the limit of quantification (<25 ng\/mL). Our results indicate that a switch from febuxostat 10 mg\/d to topiroxostat 40 mg\/d might reduce serum UA levels, with no change in other clinical laboratory data over the long term. These effects were more frequent in patients with high serum UA levels. Furthermore, topiroxostat therapy was more cost effective than febuxostat therapy. Thus, topiroxostat therapy could be a better treatment option for HD patients who develop high serum UA levels after febuxostat 10 mg\/d administration.",

        "Abstract":"Arterial hypertension is a public health problem that affects approximately 25% of the world's adult population. The association between hypertension and hyperuricemia has been shown on epidemiological and experimental studies. However, it is unclear whether lowering serum uric acid might lower blood pressure. This Cochrane systematic review - a revised edition of a previously published one - intended as primary objective to evaluate the effect of hypouricemic drugs in patients with primary hypertension or prehypertension. The secondary objectives were to evaluate the efficacy and safety of hypouricemic drugs. A systematic search until February 2016 on controlled, randomized or quasi-randomized trials comparing the effect of hypouricemic drug versus placebo in hypertensive or prehypertensive patients was performed on the following databases: The Cochrane Hypertension Specialised Register, the Cochrane Central Register of Controlled Trials (CENTRAL), Medline, Embase, The World Health Organization International Clinical Trials Registry Platform, e ClinicalTrials.gov. LILACS database up to March 2016 was also searched and the authors of relevant studies were contacted. There were 349 identified papers, 21 were preselected and three randomized clinical trials (211 patients) were included in the qualitative analysis and in the meta-analysis. Two of the trials were conducted exclusively on adolescents. The authors conclude that hypouricemic drugs are not effective in lowering blood pressure in patients with hyperuricemia and primary prehypertension or hypertension. However, this strategy might be more effective in the specific population of adolescents with prehypertension or mild primary hypertension recently diagnosed. Hypouricemic drugs effectively reduce serum uric acid level and withdrawals of therapy due to adverse effects were not superior in the treated group, comparing to placebo; however, one patient withdrew due to a severe cutaneous reaction.",

        "Abstract":"OBJECTIVE: In real life, in a substantial proportion of gouty patients receiving urate-lowering therapy (ULT), urate levels are not maintained below the target of 6.0 mg\/dl. We aimed to search for factors associated with poor control of serum uric acid (UA) levels in a large population of patients with gout receiving ULT.\nMETHODS: This cross-sectional study involved adults with gout in primary care who were receiving ULT. Demographics, gout history, comorbidities, lifestyle, clinical factors, concomitant treatments, and laboratory data were compared in well-controlled gout (serum UA ≤6.0 mg\/dl) versus poorly controlled gout (serum UA >6.0 mg\/dl) on univariate and multivariate analyses.\nRESULTS: Among the 1,995 patients receiving ULT, only 445 (22.3%) had reached the target of 6.0 mg\/dl serum UA. Such patients had a lower rate of gout flares within the previous year than patients without the target (mean ± SD 1.7 ± 1.4 versus 2.1 ± 1.4; P < 0.0001). The main factors associated with poor serum UA level control in multivariate analysis were low high-density lipoprotein cholesterol level (adjusted odds ratio [OR] 0.5 [95% confidence interval (95% CI) 0.26-0.96]; P = 0.04), high total cholesterol level (OR 1.83 [95% CI 1.29-2.60]; P = 0.0007), increased waist circumference (OR 1.55 [95% CI 1.11-2.13]; P = 0.008), and alcohol consumption (OR 1.52 [95% CI 1.15-2.00]; P = 0.003).\nCONCLUSION: Dyslipidemia, abdominal obesity, and alcohol consumption are the main factors associated with a poor response to ULT. Knowledge of these factors might help physicians identify cases of gout that may be less likely to achieve target urate level.",

SUA was measured at baseline and 12 months. Gout-related hospitalizations were based on ICD9 codes. Gout-related medication use (GRMs) was based on active prescriptions of allopurinol, colchicine, or probenecid during the baseline visit of the AASK cohort phase. We examined the effect of drug assignment on 12-month SUA (linear regression), gout-related hospitalization (Cox regression), and GRM (logistic regression).\nRESULTS: Of the 630 participants, 40% were female with a mean age of 55 years (SD, 10), mean SUA of 8.2 mg\/dl (2.0), and mean serum creatinine of 1.8 mg\/dl (0.6). After 12 months, metoprolol increased SUA by 0.3 mg\/dl, while ramipril or amlodipine had no effect on SUA. Compared to ramipril, metoprolol significantly increased 12-month SUA (0.40; 0.10, 0.70 mg\/dl; P = 0.009), nonsignificantly increased risk of gout-related hospitalization (hazard ratio: 3.87; 0.82, 18.26; P = 0.09), and significantly increased the odds of GRM (odds ratio: 1.62; 1.03, 2.54; P = 0.04). While metoprolol was associated with a higher 12-month SUA compared with amlodipine (0.57; 0.18, 0.95; P = 0.004), there was no difference in gout-related hospitalizations or GRM.\nCONCLUSIONS: Metoprolol increased SUA and GRM in African American adults. Health professionals treating patients with kidney disease at risk for gout should avoid metoprolol and possibly consider an ACEi.\nCLINICAL TRIALS REGISTRATION: Trial Number NCT00582777.",

Associations of patient (medication adherence and patient activation) and provider factors (dose escalation, low-dose initiation, and anti-inflammatory prophylaxis) with serum urate (SU) goal achievement of less than 6.0 mg\/dL were examined using multivariable logistic regression. Medication adherence was assessed as a mediator of these factors with goal achievement.\nRESULTS: A majority of patients (63%) were adherent, whereas a minority received dose escalation (31%). Medication adherence was associated with initiation of daily allopurinol doses of 100 mg\/d or less (odds ratio [OR], 1.82; 95% confidence interval [CI], 1.20-2.76). In adjusted models, adherence (OR, 2.35; 95% CI, 1.50-3.68) and dose escalation (OR, 2.48; 95% CI, 2.48-4.25) were strongly associated with SU goal attainment. Low starting allopurinol dose was positively associated with SU goal attainment (OR, 1.11; 95% CI, 1.02-1.20) indirectly through early adherence, but also had a negative direct association with SU goal attainment (OR, 0.21; 95% CI, 0.12-0.37).\nCONCLUSIONS: Medication adherence and low starting dose combined with dose escalation represent promising targets for future gout quality improvement efforts. Low starting dose is associated with better SU goal attainment through increased medication adherence, but may be beneficial only in settings where appropriate dose escalation is implemented.",

        "Abstract":"In November 2016, the American College of Physicians (ACP) published a clinical practice guideline on the management of acute and recurrent gout. This guideline differs substantially from the latest guidelines generated by the American College of Rheumatology (ACR), European League Against Rheumatism (EULAR) and 3e (Evidence, Expertise, Exchange) Initiative, despite reviewing largely the same body of evidence. The Gout, Hyperuricemia and Crystal-Associated Disease Network (G-CAN) convened an expert panel to review the methodology and conclusions of these four sets of guidelines and examine possible reasons for discordance between them. The G-CAN position, presented here, is that the fundamental pathophysiological knowledge underlying gout care, and evidence from clinical experience and clinical trials, supports a treat-to-target approach for gout aimed at lowering serum urate levels to below the saturation threshold at which monosodium urate crystals form. This practice, which is truly evidence-based and promotes the steady reduction in tissue urate crystal deposits, is promoted by the ACR, EULAR and 3e Initiative recommendations. By contrast, the ACP does not provide a clear recommendation for urate-lowering therapy (ULT) for patients with frequent, recurrent flares or those with tophi, nor does it recommend monitoring serum urate levels of patients prescribed ULT. Results from emerging clinical trials that have gout symptoms as the primary end point are expected to resolve this debate for all clinicians in the near term future.",

Allopurinol inhibits the production of uric acid. The aim of this study was to evaluate the effect of allopurinol on chronic kidney disease progression.\nMATERIALS AND METHODS: In a clinical trial, patients with stages 3 and 4 of chronic kidney disease were divided into two groups to receive allopurinol, 100 mg, daily and placebo for 12 months. Patients' kidney function and serum uric acid levels were assessed at baseline and 3, 6, and 12 months after initial administration. Subgroups of patients with severe and mild glomerular filtration rate (GFR) impairment (GFR, 15 mL\/min\/1.73 m2 to 30 mL\/min\/1.73 m2 and 30 mL\/min\/1.73 m2 to 60 mL\/min\/1.73 m2, respectively), were compared between the groups.\nRESULTS: Serum uric acid levels decreased significantly during after 12 months of allopurinol administration (P = .004). In patients with severe GFR impairment, serum creatinine levels did not decrease significantly and there was no significant increase in GFR, but in those with mild GFR impairment, serum creatinine levels decreased and GFR increase significantly (P < .001) after administration of allopurinol. These effects were not observed in the control subgroups.\nCONCLUSIONS: Allopurinol may slow down stage 3 chronic kidney disease progression and could be administered with other effective medications for controlling the kidney disease.",

        "Abstract":"BACKGROUND: Many different combinations of available data have been used to identify gout cases in large genetic studies. The aim of this study was to determine the performance of case definitions of gout using the limited items available in multipurpose cohorts for population-based genetic studies.\nMETHODS: This research was conducted using the UK Biobank Resource. Data, including genome-wide genotypes, were available for 105,421 European participants aged 40-69 years without kidney disease. Gout definitions and combinations of these definitions were identified from previous epidemiological studies. These definitions were tested for association with 30 urate-associated single-nucleotide polymorphisms (SNPs) by logistic regression, adjusted for age, sex, waist circumference, and ratio of waist circumference to height. Heritability estimates under an additive model were generated using GCTA version 1.26.0 and PLINK version 1.90b3.32 by partitioning the genome.\nRESULTS: There were 2066 (1.96%) cases defined by self-report of gout, 1652 (1.57%) defined by urate-lowering therapy (ULT) use, 382 (0.36%) defined by hospital diagnosis, 1861 (1.76%) defined by hospital diagnosis or gout-specific medications and 2295 (2.18%) defined by self-report of gout or ULT use. Association with gout at experiment-wide significance (P < 0.0017) was observed for 13 SNPs with gout using the self-report of gout or ULT use definition, 12 SNPs using the self-report of gout definition, 11 SNPs using the hospital diagnosis or gout-specific medication definition, 10 SNPs using ULT use definition and 3 SNPs using hospital diagnosis definition. Heritability estimates ranged from 0.282 to 0.308 for all definitions except hospital diagnosis (0.236).\nCONCLUSIONS: Of the limited items available in multipurpose cohorts, the case definition of self-report of gout or ULT use has high sensitivity and precision for detecting association in genetic epidemiological studies of gout.",

        "Abstract":"UNLABELLED: Uric acid has been linked with increased risk of chronic disease such as cardiovascular disease and this association has been attributed to a pro-inflammatory effect. Indeed, observational studies have shown that high uric acid is associated with high level of pro-inflammatory cytokines in the blood. However, whether high uric acid directly affects inflammation or rather represents a parallel defensive antioxidant mechanism in response to pathology that causes inflammation is unknown. To determine whether acute increase or decrease uric acid levels affects inflammation in healthy individuals, a randomized, placebo-controlled, double blind clinical study of uric acid or rasburicase with 20 healthy volunteers in each treatment-placebo group was conducted at the National Institute on Aging (NIA) Clinical Research Unit (CRU) at Harbor Hospital in Baltimore, MD. Change in inflammatory response was assessed by administering an oral lipid tolerance before and after the treatment of uric acid, rasburicase and placebo. Following uric acid administration, there was an accentuated increase in IL-6 during the oral lipid tolerance test (P<0.001). No significant differences were observed after lowering of uric acid with rasburicase. No side effects were reported throughout the trial. In health individuals, acute increase in uric acid results in an increased IL-6 response when challenged with lipid load. Such effect of amplification of inflammatory response may explain the higher risk of chronic diseases observed in subclinical hyperuricemia in observational studies.\nTRIAL REGISTRATION: ClinicalTrials.gov NCT01323335.",

        "Abstract":"OBJECTIVE: Management of gout is frequently suboptimal. The aim of this study was to determine the proportion of patients presenting to Christchurch Hospital for a gout flare and to determine whether management for both acute flares and urate lowering was in accordance with international recommendations.\nMETHODS: A retrospective audit was undertaken of all admissions to Christchurch Hospital from June 1, 2013, to May 31, 2014, in which gout was coded as a primary or secondary discharge diagnosis. Information including demographics, comorbidities, concomitant medications, treatment of acute gout, and urate lowering was collected.\nRESULTS: A total of 235 acute admissions for gout in 216 individuals were identified. Eleven individuals had 2 admissions and 4 individuals had 3 admissions. In 95\/235 admissions (40.4%), gout was the primary diagnosis. Gout accounted for 95\/77,321 (0.12%) of acute admissions. The treatment of acute gout was prednisone monotherapy in 170\/235 (72.3%) of admissions. Serum urate was measured at some point during 123\/235 (52.3%) of admissions, with only 19\/123 (15.4%) at target urate level (< 0.36 mmol\/l). At 60 of the 235 admissions, urate-lowering therapy was already being prescribed. Nine out of 175 patients (5.1%) not treated with urate-lowering therapy at admission commenced allopurinol and 32\/174 (18.4%) had commencement of urate-lowering therapy recommended in the discharge plan.\nCONCLUSION: Rates of admission for gout are similar to that observed in other studies. Failure to initiate, change, or recommend alterations in urate-lowering therapy to achieve target urate in people with gout admitted to hospital represents a significant lost opportunity to improve longterm gout management.",

In vitro experiment aimed to evaluate apple polyphenols' ability to lower uric acid in comparison with allopurinol. In vivo study consisted in a randomized, double-blind, parallel placebo-controlled clinical trial involving 62 overweight volunteers with suboptimal values of fasting plasma glucose (100 mg\/dL≤FPG≤125 mg\/dL), randomized to 300 mg apple polyphenols or placebo for 8 weeks. Apple polyphenols extract inhibited xanthine oxidase activity, with an IC50 = 130 ± 30 ng\/mL; reducing uric acid production with an IC50 = 154 ± 28 ng\/mL. During the trial, after the first 4 weeks of treatment, FPG decreased in the active treated group (-6.1%, p < 0.05), while no significant changes were observed regarding the other hematochemistry parameters. After 4 more weeks of treatment, active-treated patients had an improvement in FPG compared to baseline (-10.3%, p < 0,001) and the placebo group (p < 0,001).

        "Abstract":"Although uric acid is not part of any definition of metabolic syndrome, a number of studies have shown strong associations between the concentration of uric acid and metabolic syndrome or its components. The purpose of this systematic review with meta-analysis was to evaluate, using prospective interventional studies, the effects of allopurinol therapy and uric acid normalization on serum concentrations of triacylglycerol, total-cholesterol, LDL-cholesterol and HDL-cholesterol in hyperuricemic subjects. A systematic search of the PubMed and Scopus databases was performed following the guidelines described in the PRISMA statement. Seven studies were included in the meta-analysis, including six randomized controlled trials and one controlled before-and-after study. Despite differences in the follow-up periods (4, 12 and 24weeks) and allopurinol dose (100-300mg\/day), all the studies showed decreases in the mean serum uric acid level (95% confidence interval: -2.61 to -1.55 (4weeks), -2.94 to -1.09 (12weeks) and -2.59 to -1.22 (24weeks); p<0.05). However, no effect was observed based on differences in mean serum triacylglycerol and total- and LDL-cholesterol concentrations, independent of the follow-up period. Allopurinol therapy during weeks 4 and 12 induced a decrease in the mean HDL-cholesterol level (95% confidence interval: -7.22 to -0.47 (4weeks) and -7.18 to -0.32 (12weeks); p<0.05). This review suggests that allopurinol and uric acid normalization does not improve serum lipid levels, although larger and longer trials of higher quality are needed to confirm this.",

Although topiroxostat, a novel, non-purine, selective xanthine oxidase inhibitor, has a strong effect against hyperuricemia, limited data are available on its renoprotective effect against CKD.\nMETHODS: This study was conducted between October 2014 and May 2016. Thirty patients (20 male, 10 female) were administered 40 mg\/day of topiroxostat twice daily. All patients were followed for a year. To elucidate the effects of topiroxostat, we evaluated the clinically documented primary indication of progression, viz. laboratory evidence of kidney function decline (reference indicator), uric acid, and hypertension in different patient groups, separated according to their baseline uProt levels and baseline eGFR.\nRESULTS: Topiroxostat treatment resulted in significant reduction in SUA (-1.53 mg\/dL), systolic blood pressure (-8.9 mmHg), diastolic blood pressure (-5.0 mmHg), and urinary protein excretion (-795.5 mg\/gCr) compared with baseline values. However, serum creatinine and urinary NAG levels, and estimated glomerular filtration rate did not change significantly.\nCONCLUSIONS: Topiroxostat reduced SUA levels effectively and may exhibit renoprotective effect in hyperuricemic patients with CKD. Further studies are required to clarify whether topiroxostat prevents the progression of renal disease and improves the prognosis of CKD patients.",

        "Abstract":"The current paper aimed to describe the quality of care for gout patients by showing the clinical outcomes achieved in two patient cohorts in which differing targeted urate lowering therapy (ULT) treatment approaches were employed, both aiming to reach the European League Against Rheumatism recommended serum urate (sUA) targets. A retrospective medical chart review study was conducted. Data from the medical records of gout patients from two clinical centers in The Netherlands, both applying targeted ULT treatments (albeit using different approaches), were reviewed. Patients in cohort A were given a combination of xanthine oxidase inhibitors with uricosurics if treatment with allopurinol monotherapy failed to reach sUA target levels, whereas patients in cohort B were treated with sequential monotherapy. Data on patient characteristics and clinical outcomes were collected. A total of 177 patient dossiers were included: 99 from cohort A and 78 from cohort B. The great majority (n = 146, 82.5%) of the patients in both cohorts had a current sUA level <360 µmol\/L. In addition, more than half (n = 104, 58.8%) of the patients met the stringent sUA target level of <300 µmol\/L. The largest reductions in mean sUA levels were observed for patients who were treated with combination therapy. This clinical audit of two cohorts of gout patients provides initial-yet promising-results regarding the proportion of real-world gout patients in whom recommended that sUA target levels can be achieved, and demonstrates the added value that a targeted treatment approach may have in reaching these goals.",

        "Abstract":"PURPOSE: Verinurad (RDEA3170) is a selective uric acid reabsorption inhibitor in clinical development for the treatment of gout and asymptomatic hyperuricemia. The aim of this study was to evaluate the pharmacokinetics, pharmacodynamics, and tolerability of verinurad in healthy adult males.\nSUBJECTS AND METHODS: This was a Phase I, randomized, double-blind, placebo-controlled, single and multiple ascending dose study. Panels of eight male subjects received a single oral dose of verinurad or placebo in either a fasted or fed state; panels of 10-12 male subjects received ascending doses of once-daily verinurad or placebo in a fasted state for 10 days. Serial blood and urine samples were assayed for verinurad and uric acid. Safety was assessed by adverse event (AE) reports, laboratory tests, vital signs, and electrocardiograms (ECGs).\nRESULTS: A total of 81 adult males completed the study. Following single doses of verinurad, maximum observed plasma concentration (C) and area under the plasma concentration-time curve (AUC) increased in a dose-proportional manner; C occurred at 0.5-0.75 hours and 1.25 hours in the fasted and fed states, respectively. Food decreased AUC by 23% and C by 37%-53%. There was a modest accumulation of verinurad following multiple daily doses. Verinurad reduced serum urate levels by up to 62% (40 mg, single dose) and 61% (10 mg, multiple dose). The increase in urinary excretion of uric acid was greatest in the first 6 hours after dosing and was still evident ≥24 hours for verinurad doses ≥2 mg. Verinurad was well tolerated at all doses. No serious AEs, severe AEs, discontinuations due to AEs, or clinically significant laboratory or ECG abnormalities were reported.\nCONCLUSION: Single and multiple doses of verinurad were well tolerated, absorption was rapid, and exposure was dose proportional. Verinurad increased urinary uric acid elimination and resulted in sustained reductions in serum urate. These data support further clinical evaluation of once-daily verinurad as a treatment for gout.",

It results in metabolic derangements, including hyperuricemia and acute renal failure. The powerful management for TLS is a daily dose of rasburicase for up to 5 days before chemotherapy; however, the optimal dose and duration of rasburicase for TLS prophylaxis have not been standardized for patients at high risk for TLS. Therefore, we evaluated the efficacy of single-dose rasburicase for prophylactic purposes in patients with malignant lymphoma at high risk for TLS.\nPATIENTS AND MATERIALS: We retrospectively evaluated patients with malignant lymphoma at high risk for TLS treated with a prophylactic single-dose of rasburicase (0.1-0.2 mg\/kg) from March 2012 to March 2016.\nRESULTS: A total of 67 patients treated with a single-dose of rasburicase for prophylaxis were analyzed. A relatively large number of patients (n = 23; 34.3%) had the highly proliferative lymphoblastic lymphoma subtype (n = 14) or Burkitt lymphoma (n = 9) and were at the highest risks of tumor lysis. Two patients were newly diagnosed with TLS; the incidence of TLS after single-dose prophylaxis was 3.0%. Multivariate analysis revealed no predictable risk factors for response to prophylactic rasburicase, though increased level of serum creatinine approached statistical significance in reducing the efficacy of single-dose rasburicase to prevent TLS (odds ratio, 3.61; P = .054).\nCONCLUSION: Our data indicated that single-dose rasburicase effectively prevented progression of TLS, and, regardless of any risk factors, including increased creatinine, single-dose rasburicase for TLS prophylaxis was useful in patients with lymphoma at a high risk for TLS.",

The management of gout implies both the treatment of flares and the treatment of hyperuricaemia itself. Recent improvement in the understanding of the disease led to the development of new drugs. Areas covered: This review covers data related to 'old' treatments of flares and hyperuricaemia, evidence on the recently approved drugs and emerging therapies in development. Expert opinion: Recent data provide a good grasp of the optimal use of colchicine, corticosteroids and NSAIDs for the treatment of flares. Interleukin-1 blocking therapies have an increasing role in the management of difficult-to-treat gout. Sub-optimal use of allopurinol is common and its potency to reduce serum uric acid (SUA) levels is underestimated. Febuxostat effectively reduces SUA levels. New uricosurics, notably lesinurad and arhalofenate, in combination with xanthine oxidase inhibitors, offer promising perspectives to help a greater number of patients achieve sufficient SUA reduction.",

In vivo, urate is known to have both an anti- or pro-oxidant role depending on several biological conditions. New evidence suggests that chronic hyperuricemia can contribute to hypertension development, kidney disease and cardiovascular risk. The pathophysiologic mechanisms are various, such as endothelial dysfunction and oxidative stress, vasoconstriction and stimulation of renin angiotensin system. These processes act at the kidney level, within arterioles and tubular cells, as well as at the systemic vasculature and tissue level causing hypertension, atherosclerosis and myocardial dysfunction. In recent years evidence has grown that asymptomatic hyperuricemia is a possible risk factor for the development of hypertension, diabetes as well as renal and cardiovascular events. Preliminary clinical evidence suggests that lowering uric acid levels by the use of xanthine-oxidase inhibitors may improve cardiovascular and renal risk. Several ongoing trials, both with allopurinol and febuxostat, will clarify this issue in the upcoming years.",

        "Abstract":"Nonalcoholic fatty liver disease (NAFLD), the most common chronic liver disease in Western countries with potential progression to nonalcoholic steatohepatitis (NASH) and cirrhosis, is associated with cardiovascular disease (CVD) mortality. Several studies have reported a relationship between uric acid and NAFLD\/NASH and it seems that serum uric acid (SUA) is a significant independent factor for the development of NAFLD. Potential mediating mechanisms include insulin resistance, endothelial dysfunction, and activation of inflammasome, especially NLRP3. Moreover, emerging evidence indicates a strong association between elevated SUA, metabolic syndrome (MetS), NAFLD, and CVD. The emphasis of the present review is whether common therapy of elevated SUA levels and NAFLD can improve compliance. There are several drugs with \"off target\" properties that show some separate benefit on SUA reduction (e.g. losartan) or NAFLD\/NASH (pioglitazone); however, there is no randomized controlled trial (RCT) of a single drug with beneficial outcome for both diseases. Allopurinol reduces SUA levels and ameliorates NAFLD\/NASH; however, no RCTs have been performed up to now to explore potential survival benefits. Atorvastatin, which has proven safe in NAFLD\/NASH, reduces SUA levels, ameliorates NAFLD\/NASH, prevents liver fibrosis, and above all substantially reduces CVD morbidity and mortality in comparison with those on statins but without NAFLD\/NASH. This drug could be a solution to improve compliance in both diseases, which are prevalent and becoming even more common with the obesity, MetS, and type 2 diabetes mellitus epidemic.",

        "Abstract":"Gout is a rheumatologic condition associated with elevated serum uric acid levels and deposition of monosodium urate crystals in joints and soft tissues. Areas covered: In this article, we describe the role of currently available drug therapies for managing acute gout flares and used in reducing serum urate levels. Further, we explore the role of novel small molecular therapies and biologic agents in the treatment of refractory or severe gout symptoms. A literature search of MEDLINE and MEDLINE In-Process & Other Non-Indexed Citations Databases (1996-June 2017) was conducted utilizing the key words 'gout', 'interleukin-1 inhibitors', 'acute gout', 'gout treatment', 'urate lowering therapies', 'hyperuricemia', 'colchicine', 'pegloticase', 'lesinurad', 'xanthine oxidase', 'xanthine oxidase inhibitors', 'allopurinol', 'febuxostat', 'uricosurics', 'probenecid', and 'benzbromarone'. All published articles regarding therapeutic management of gout and hyperuricemia were evaluated. References of selected articles, data from poster presentations, and abstract publications were additionally reviewed. Expert opinion: Numerous therapies are currently available to managing acute gout flares and for lowering serum urate levels; advances in the understanding of the pathophysiology of this disorder has led to the emergence of targeted therapies and novel biologic preparations currently in development which may improve the clinical management of severe or refractory cases of disease that fail to respond to traditional therapies.",

The target of the research envisaged was to elucidate the activity of  extract on hyperuricemic condition in arthritis rat model.\nMATERIALS AND METHODS: Dried and powdered plant leaves were extracted using ether and chloroform. Potassium oxonate was injected intra-articularly to produce arthritis. The hyperuricemic effect, of  was analyzed by studying levels of uric acid in serum as well as in urine of arthritis induced rats. Effects of plant extracts were also studied on BUN (blood urea nitrogen) levels and fraction of uric acid excreted.\nRESULTS: Results indicate that administration of  presented substantial change in uric acid concentration, augmented by potassium oxonate administration in rats. The reduction in levels of uric acid levels was nearly same as allopurinol. The investigation also revealed that the primary plant extract has nephroprotective effect by enhancing the production of Prostaglandin E and Interleukin-1. Histological studies of rat kidney slices indicated the safety of the present plant extract.\nCONCLUSION: The crude extract of  can be used to reduce hyperuricemia in metabolic arthritis produced in rat model, without inducing any potential damaging effects.",

        "Abstract":"Tophaceous gout is painful and impairs quality of life. The optimal modality for assessing tophus resolution in response to urate-lowering treatment remains poorly defined. Using pegloticase as a model system for resolving tophi, we compared multiple imaging and physical diagnostic strategies for assessing tophus resolution. A 32-year-old subject with chronic refractory tophaceous gout was enrolled and received 6 months of pegloticase treatment. Measurements of tophi using vernier calipers (monthly), photographs and musculoskeletal ultrasound (MSK-US; every 3 months), and dual-energy CT (DECT) were compared. Pegloticase persistently lowered the patient's sUA to <0.5 mg\/dl. After 6 months, caliper measurements revealed 73, 60, and 61% reductions of three index tophi, while MSK-US revealed 47, 65, and 48% reductions. In contrast, DECT revealed 100% resolution of monosodium urate deposition in all three index tophi, and resolution or improvement of all other tophi identified. On caliper and MSK-US measurement, index tophus size fluctuated, with some lesions enlarging before ultimately contracting. Correlation between assessment modalities during tophus resolution may be poor. DECT identifies urate deposits invisible to physical exam and reveals that some urate deposits completely resolve even as their physically\/sonographically measurable lesions persist. Recognition of urate resorption during the urate-lowering process may be confounded by fluctuating lesion volumes during initial tophus breakdown. While DECT was superior for identifying total (including occult) urate deposition, and assessing volume of deposits, other modalities may permit better assessment of non-urate tophus components.",

        "Abstract":"AIMS AND OBJECTIVES: To examine the factors influencing adherence to urate-lowering therapy in patients with gout in Singapore.\nBACKGROUND: Gout is the most common type of chronic inflammatory arthritis. Urate-lowering therapy is used to treat gout by reducing serum uric acid levels. However, adherence to urate-lowering therapy among patients remains poor. To date, there have been no available studies based on a conceptual framework that examined factors influencing medication adherence in patients with gout.\nDESIGN: Cross-sectional, descriptive correlational study.\nMETHODS: A convenience sample of outpatients (n = 108) was recruited between October 2014-January 2015 from a tertiary hospital in Singapore. Outcomes were measured by relevant valid and reliable instruments. Descriptive statistics and parametric tests including multiple linear regression were used to analyse the data.\nRESULTS: Although 44.4% of the participants were high adherers to urate-lowering therapy, the mean adherence level was moderate. Significant differences in medication adherence scores were found among the subgroups of gender, ethnicity, marital status, employment status and presence of comorbidity. Medication adherence was positively significantly correlated with age, number of comorbidities and beliefs about medicines. Linear regression showed that higher level of beliefs about medicines, presence of comorbidity and being married were factors positively influencing medication adherence.\nCONCLUSIONS: This study revealed moderate adherence to urate-lowering therapy in patients with gout in Singapore, indicating the need for strategies to improve adherence by considering its main influencing factors. Future research should be conducted to develop interventions targeted at modifying patients' beliefs about medicines in order to improve medication adherence.\nRELEVANCE TO CLINICAL PRACTICE: Findings from this study allow healthcare providers to quickly and easily identify patients who may have low adherence. Nurses should take the lead in educating patients on the mechanism of urate-lowering therapy and highlight the importance of adhering to it.",

        "Abstract":"BACKGROUND: We previously reported that febuxostat was more effective for hyperuricemia than allopurinol. The efficacy, however, of topiroxostat (a novel xanthine oxidase reductase inhibitor similar to febuxostat), for hyperuricemia is unknown.\nMETHODS AND RESULTS: Patients with cardiovascular disease and hyperuricemia, in whom serum uric acid (s-UA) was controlled at ≤6 mg\/dL, were eligible for enrollment. Fifty-five patients were randomized to receive either febuxostat or topiroxostat for 6 months and were switched to the other drug for the following 6 months. The primary endpoint was s-UA. Secondary endpoints included serum creatinine, estimated glomerular filtration rate, urinary albumin, cystatin-C, oxidized low-density lipoprotein, eicosapentaenoic acid\/arachidonic acid ratio, lipid biomarkers, high-sensitivity C-reactive protein and B-type natriuretic protein. Although s-UA level was similar for both drugs, significantly more patients required dose escalation during treatment with topiroxostat. There were no differences in renal function, inflammatory and lipid markers between the 2 drugs. A biomarker of oxidative stress was significantly lower after 3 months of febuxostat compared with topiroxostat.\nCONCLUSIONS: Febuxostat causes more marked and more rapid reduction of s-UA than topiroxostat. With regard to the antioxidant effect, febuxostat was superior to topiroxostat after 3 months. The renal protective and anti-inflammatory effects of both drugs were also similar after 6 months of treatment. Thus, both of these agents were similarly effective for hyperuricemia in patients with cardiovascular disease.",

The primary end point was the proportion of patients achieving a serum UA level of <5.0 mg\/dl (month 6). The key secondary end point was the proportion of patients with complete resolution of ≥1 target tophus (month 12). Other end points included the percentage change in total target tophi area. Safety assessments included adverse events and laboratory data.\nRESULTS: Patients (n = 324) were predominantly male, with a mean age of 54.1 years. Significantly more patients achieved the serum UA target by month 6 with the addition of lesinurad 400 mg (76.1%; P < 0.0001), but not 200 mg (56.6%; P = 0.13), to the febuxostat therapy as compared with febuxostat alone (46.8%). At all other time points, significantly more patients in the lesinurad 200 mg group achieved the serum UA target. The number of patients with complete tophus resolution was not different between groups. Treatment with lesinurad (200 mg and 400 mg) plus febuxostat reduced the total target tophi area as compared with febuxostat alone (50.1% and 52.9% versus 28.3%, respectively; P < 0.05). Safety was generally comparable with that of febuxostat alone, except for higher rates of predominantly reversible elevations in the serum creatinine level, particularly with lesinurad 400 mg.\nCONCLUSION: Treatment with lesinurad in combination with febuxostat demonstrated superior lowering of serum UA levels as compared with febuxostat alone, with clinically relevant added effects on tophi and an acceptable safety profile with lesinurad 200 mg in patients with tophaceous gout warranting additional therapy.",

        "Abstract":"Over the last decade, there have been major advances in the understanding of the genetic basis of hyperuricaemia and gout as well as of the pharmacogenetics of urate-lowering therapy. Key findings include the reporting of 28 urate-associated loci, the discovery that ABCG2 plays a central role on extra-renal uric acid excretion, the identification of genes associated with development of gout in the context of hyperuricaemia, recognition that ABCG2 variants influence allopurinol response, and the impact of HLA-B*5801 testing in reducing the prevalence of allopurinol hypersensitivity in high-risk populations. These advances, together with the reducing cost of whole genome sequencing, mean that integrated personalised medicine approaches may soon be possible in clinical practice. Genetic data may inform assessment of disease prognosis in individuals with hyperuricaemia or established gout, personalised lifestyle advice, selection and dosing of urate-lowering therapy, and prevention of serious medication adverse effects. In this article, we summarise the discoveries from genome-wide association studies and discuss the potential for translation of these findings into clinical practice.",

A cross-sectional study was administered to 125 gout patients using the Compliance Questionnaire on Rheumatology (CQR) for adherence to ULT. Patients were asked to complete the Treatment Satisfaction Questionnaire for Medication version II, Health Assessment Questionnaire, Confidence in Gout Treatment Questionnaire, Gout Knowledge Questionnaire, Patient Health Questionnaire-9, Generalized Anxiety Disorder-7, and 36-Item Short Form Health Survey. Data were analyzed by independent sample t test, rank sum test, Chi-square analysis as well as binary stepwise logistic regression modeling. The data showed that the rate of adherence (CQR ≥80%) to ULT was 9.6% in our investigated gout patients. Adherence was associated with functional capacity, gout-related knowledge, satisfaction with medication, confidence in gout treatment and mental components summary. Multivariable analysis of binary stepwise logistic regression identified gout-related knowledge and satisfaction of effectiveness with medication was the independent risk factors of medication non-adherence. Patients unaware of gout-related knowledge, or with low satisfaction of effectiveness with medication, were more likely not to adhere to ULT. Non-adherence to ULT among gout patients is exceedingly common, particularly in patients unaware of gout-related knowledge, or with low satisfaction of effectiveness with medication.

From these, 168 graduates responded (23.7% response rate). Most (81.1%) felt that gout was a serious disease, 51.2% answered that they had been taught adequately to manage acute gout, only 37.2% for chronic gout. In an acute gout flare, 63.4% answered they would continue urate lowering therapy and 67.2% were aware of first-line pharmacological management options; 28% answered the correct dosing regimen for colchicine. Chronic management was answered poorly. Only 42.0% stated they would titrate allopurinol dosing to a target urate level; 23.5% would check the urate level monthly. More than half, 56.8%, were aware that medical prophylaxis is indicated when initiating urate lowering therapy. Of this subgroup, 46.7% (25.9% overall) knew that non-steroidal anti-inflammatory drugs and colchicine were recommended and 28.4% (15.4% overall) answered the correct timeframe of use. Close to one-third (35.0%), were aware of febuxostat, probenecid and benzbromarone as second-line urate lowering therapy.\nCONCLUSION: The findings of this study suggest that new graduates' knowledge of gout management, especially chronic management, is suboptimal.

People with gout who participated in previous research at academic rheumatology, University of Nottingham, UK, and consented for participation in future studies were mailed a questionnaire in September 2015. Those returning completed questionnaires were invited to attend for a study visit at which blood was collected and musculoskeletal examination was performed. The Gout Assessment Questionnaire, which contains the gout impact scale (GIS), and short form (SF) 36v2 questionnaires were completed. The GAS score was calculated. Spearman's correlation coefficient was calculated to examine correlation between GAS and SF-36 v2, and GIS.

In the present study, we studied patient characteristics that may mask favorable impact of antihyperuricemic therapy on the progression of CKD.\nMETHODS: This was a single-center, retrospective, follow-up study. One-hundred and seventy-eight CKD patients with hyperuricemia who received febuxostat therapy were included in this study. Mean serum uric acid (mUA) level after treatment and changes in estimated glomerular filtration rate (ΔeGFR) over 6 months were measured and their correlation was examined. Patients were divided into two groups based on mUA, and their ΔeGFR were compared. These analyses were evaluated in various subgroups.\nRESULTS: Febuxostat therapy markedly decreased UA level in any CKD stage patients without resulting in serious adverse events. eGFRs of CKD patients in the mUA < 6.0 mg\/dl group were maintained, whereas those in the mUA ≥ 6.0 mg\/dl group decreased. A significant inverse correlation was observed between mUA and ΔeGFR (r = -0.16, p = 0.019). The renoprotective effects of febuxostat were significant in the following subgroups: male patients, age < 70 years, systolic blood pressure < 130 mmHg, normal cholesterol levels, and absence of diabetes. Coexisting vascular risk factors appear to exert additive masking effects against febuxostat renoprotection.\nCONCLUSIONS: The results of this study suggest that various vascular risk factors markedly attenuate the renoprotective effects of febuxostat.",

        "Abstract":"PURPOSE: Because of the evolutionary loss of the uricolytic pathway, humans accumulate poorly soluble urate as the final product of purine catabolism. Restoration of uricolysis through enzyme therapy is a promising treatment for severe hyperuricemia caused by deficiency of hypoxanthine-guanine phosphoribosyltransferase (HPRT). To this end, we studied the effect of PEG conjugation on the activity and stability of the enzymatic complement required for conversion of urate into the more soluble (S)-allantoin.\nMETHODS: We produced in recombinant form three zebrafish enzymes required in the uricolytic pathway. We carried out a systematic study of the effect of PEGylation on the function and stability of the three enzymes by varying PEG length, chemistry and degree of conjugation. We assayed in vitro the uricolytic activity of the PEGylated enzymatic triad.\nRESULTS: We defined conditions that allow PEGylated enzymes to retain native-like enzymatic activity even after lyophilization or prolonged storage. A combination of the three enzymes in an appropriate ratio allowed efficient conversion of urate to (S)-allantoin with no accumulation of intermediate metabolites.\nCONCLUSIONS: Pharmaceutical restoration of the uricolytic pathway is a viable approach for the treatment of severe hyperuricemia.",

        "Abstract":"BACKGROUND: Endothelial dysfunction is an important risk factor for cardiovascular diseases to occur in end-stage renal disease patients. Febuxostat, being a novel xanthine oxidase inhibitor, is apparently having a beneficial role in improving the endothelial dysfunction; however, data among hemodialysis patients are still limited.\nMETHODS: A prospective, placebo-controlled, block-randomized, double-blinded study was carried out to evaluate the effect of oral febuxostat on the endothelial dysfunction in hemodialysis patients. Fifty-seven eligible hemodialysis patients were randomly assigned to either the drug group (40 mg thrice weekly) or the placebo group. Serum Asymmetric dimethylarginine (ADMA), Serum uric acid (UA), and serum high sensitivity C-reactive protein (hsCRP) were measured at baseline and at the end of a 2-month study. Serum alanine aminotransferase (ALT), serum aspartate aminotransferase (AST), and the occurrence of pancytopenia were tested as safety parameters at baseline and at the end of study.\nRESULTS: Serum UA significantly decreased from 7.5 ± 0.8 to 5.1 ± 1.2 mg\/dL in the febuxostat group, while it did not change significantly in the placebo group. Treatment with febuxostat resulted in a significant decrease in the serum ADMA level from 1.027 ± 0.116 to 0.944 ± 0.104 µmol\/L and the serum hsCRP level from 12.5 ± 1.65 to 12.1 ± 1.70 mg\/L.

        "Abstract":"Febuxostat has currently played pivotal role in the treatment of hyperuricemia, but there is little comprehensive information for the determinants of individual difference in efficacy of febuxostat. Therefore, the present study, a retrospective investigation, was carried out to analyze the effects of patient characteristics on the efficacy of febuxostat. A total of 225 patients who were continuously prescribed the same dose of febuxostat for 8-12 weeks from the initial therapy were enrolled in the present study. The data, including patient information and laboratory data, were collected from electronic medical records. Serum urate lowering effects of febuxostat were evaluated by calculating the change in serum urate level at baseline and at 8-12 weeks after starting febuxostat. The multiple regression analysis showed the change in serum urate level was significantly lower in male patients and in those with a lower baseline serum urate level, higher previous dose of allopurinol, lower dose of febuxostat and lower body surface area-unadjusted estimated glomerular filtration rate. Concomitantly administered drugs did not show a significantly influence on the efficacy of febuxostat. In conclusion, it should be noted that the serum urate lowering efficacy of febuxostat may decrease in patients with a higher previous dose of allopurinol, renal impairment or male patients. The basic findings of the present study are believed to contribute to the proper use of febuxostat.",

Although the presence of CKD poses additional challenges in gout management, effective urate lowering is possible for most patients with CKD.

Management of gout flares with presently available agents can be more challenging due to potential nephrotoxicity and\/or contraindications in the setting of other common comorbid conditions.

This randomized controlled trial enrolled 46 patients diagnosed with gout from Zhongshan Hospital, China, between October 2013 and June 2014. Epidemiological data, serum uric acid level, and arthritis attacks were recorded at monthly follow-up visits. DECT of bilateral feet and ankles was performed at baseline and after 6 months of ULT. Overall, 163 areas of urate deposition were found in the 46 patients; of these, 133\/163 (81.6%) areas were associated with former arthritis attacks.

        "Abstract":"BACKGROUND: 1-2% of adults in Germany suffer from gout. Gout is one of the few rheumatological diseases that can be cured. It arises through the deposition of uric acid crystals in joints as a result of hyperuricemia. Painful redness and swelling of the affected joints are typical findings. Multiple pertinent guidelines and treatment recommendations have been published, but there is reason to believe that patients with gout are not always treated accordingly.\nMETHODS: This review is based on relevant publications from the years 2000-2016 that were retrieved by a selective search in the Cochrane and PubMed databases.\nRESULTS: In a person with normal renal function, asymptomatic hyperuricemia is not an indication for treatment to lower the serum uric acid level. The drugs of first choice for acute gouty arthritis are nonsteroidal antiinflammatory drugs (NSAID), corticosteroids, and colchicine. Treatment with xanthine oxidase inhibitors (XOI) or uricosuric drugs is indicated for patients with a recurrent or severe course; the target uric acid value is <6 mg\/dL. Long-term treatment should be initiated only after resolution of the acute attack. For patients with refractory gout, lesinurad (approved in February 2016) in combination with XOI is a new treatment option that can be considered. Comprehensive patient education and counseling is an important component of the treatment of patients with gout. Regular laboratory follow-up is necessary as well.\nCONCLUSION: The prevalence of gout is rising around the world. Patients with gout could benefit greatly from consistent implementation of the existing treatment guidelines and recommendations. In the future, controlled trials should be conducted to determine the best time to start treatment and the optimal target level for the serum uric acid concentration in terms of a risk\/benefit analysis.",

Polydatin administration decreased the levels of uric acid and creatinine in serum and urine, leading to inhibition of pro-inflammatory cytokine production in serum and kidney. Western blot analyses illustrated that polydatin down-regulated the translocation of NF-κB p65, the degradation of IκBα, and the protein levels of inflammasome components (NLRP3, ASC, and caspase-1), which led to reduced IL-1β secretion. Notably, polydatin treatment activated AMP kinase (AMPK) protein and increased SIRT1 expression.

Lesinurad 200 mg once daily is indicated for use in combination with a xanthine oxidase inhibitor (XOI) to treat hyperuricaemia in adults with gout who have not achieved target sUA levels with an XOI alone. Approval was based on three 12-month phase 3 trials that evaluated lesinurad in combination with allopurinol in adults with gout inadequately responsive to allopurinol (CLEAR 1 and 2) and in combination with febuxostat in adults with tophaceous gout (CRYSTAL). The target sUA level of <6 mg\/dL at 6 months (primary endpoint) was achieved by significantly more lesinurad plus allopurinol than placebo plus allopurinol recipients in the CLEAR trials. In CRYSTAL (which enrolled patients regardless of prior XOI experience, and included 3 weeks of febuxostat before randomization), the proportion of patients who achieved an sUA target of <5 mg\/dL did not reach statistical significance between lesinurad plus febuxostat and placebo plus febuxostat at 6 months (primary endpoint), although significantly favoured the lesinurad plus febuxostat group at 12 months. Notably, the sUA target of <5 mg\/dL at 6 months was met with lesinurad plus febuxostat in the CRYSTAL subgroup that had uncontrolled hyperuricaemia at baseline, despite having received febuxostat pre-randomization. Lesinurad plus XOI regimens were generally not associated with improvements in flares and tophi in these trials, although clinical benefit became more apparent in 12-month extension studies; the regimens were also generally well tolerated. Thus, lesinurad, in combination with an XOI, is an emerging option for the treatment of hyperuricaemia in adults with gout who have not achieved target sUA levels with an XOI alone.",

In 81 patients (205 samples), creatinine clearance (CL ), concomitant diuretic use and SU concentrations before (U ) and during (U ) treatment were monitored across a range of allopurinol doses (D, 50-700 mg daily). Plasma concentrations of oxypurinol (C) were measured in 47 patients (98 samples). Models (n = 47 patients) and predictions from each relationship were compared using F-tests, r values and paired t-tests. The best model was used to construct a nomogram.\nRESULTS: The final plasma oxypurinol concentration-response relationship (U  = U  - C*(U  - U )\/(ID  + C), r  = 0.64) and allopurinol dose-response relationship (U  = U  - D (U  - U )\/(ID  + D), r  = 0.60) did not include CL or diuretic use as covariates. There was no difference (P = 0.87) between the predicted SU concentrations derived from the oxypurinol concentration- and allopurinol dose-response relationships. The nomogram constructed using the allopurinol dose-response relationship for all recruited patients (n = 81 patients) required pretreatment SU as the predictor of allopurinol maintenance dose.\nCONCLUSIONS: Plasma oxypurinol concentrations, CL and diuretic status are not required to predict the maintenance dose of allopurinol. Using the nomogram, the maintenance dose of allopurinol estimated to reach target concentrations can be predicted from U .",

Although only a minority of our population develops clinically relevant symptomatic hyperuricemia, there is growing evidence that elevated serum uric acid levels might be associated with elevated cardiovascular risk and cardiovascular disease progression. But it is not clear whether uric acid is just a biomarker or exerts detrimental effects itself. The xanthine oxidoreductase (XOR) is an essential enzyme for the generation of uric acid. A typical pharmacological therapy to reduce the uric acid amounts is inhibition of XOR. There is good evidence that inhibition of uric acid reduces cardiovascular events in patients. The question arises if XOR inhibition might be an attractive target to reduce cardiovascular events in patients with high or even normal uric acid levels.\nMETHOD: This review summarizes the available publications on the relationship between XOR and cardiovascular co-morbidities.\nRESULTS: The association of elevated serum uric acid level with oxidative damage in the vessel wall, inflammatory and proliferative vascular changes, hypertension and impaired kidney function are depicted. In addition, the therapeutics currently approved for the treatments of hyperuricemia are outlined and an overview regarding novel, currently researched XOR inhibitors is provided.\nCONCLUSION: Observational and small prospective studies already have given hints for positive cardiovascular effects of XOR inhibition. However, larger prospective studies investigating cardiovascular outcomes are awaited to validate the potential beneficial effect of XOR inhibition for reduction of the cardiovascular burden.",

Nevertheless, the effectiveness of biological drugs is limited by their inherent short biological half-life and poor stability in vivo. Herein, we engineered a novel delivery platform based on hybrid injectable hydrogels, in which pH- and temperature-responsive biodegradable copolymers were site-specifically coupled to the sulfhydryl group of human serum albumin, which effectively enhances the stability and circulation half-life of the biological drug, recombinant uricase enzyme (Uox). The albumin ligand conjugated to the Uox allowed specific-binding of the enzyme within the protein shell, and the synthetic polymers effectively shield the protein-enzyme complex. Such close confinement exhibits strong resistance towards various physical, chemical and therapeutically relevant stressors such as temperature, pH and proteases. Subcutaneous administration of Uox-loaded bioengineered hybrid hydrogel improved the pharmacokinetics by prolonging its circulation half-life. As a consequence, the bioengineered hybrid hydrogel normalized the serum uric acid level in hypoxanthine\/potassium oxonate-induced hyperuricemia mice, and no obvious side effects were observed in the major organs. The characteristic of the bioengineered hydrogel networks applicable to a variety of biological drugs by simple mixing that unlock the possibility of adapting biological drugs to therapeutic applications.",

        "Published":"2017-04-12",
        "Abstract":"INTRODUCTION: In 2006, recommendations about the management of gout were issued by the European League Against Rheumatism (EULAR). The objective of this work was to compare these recommendations to practice patterns of physicians working in private practices in France.\nMETHOD: In a prospective multicenter nationwide study conducted in France, a random sample of primary-care physicians (PCPs) and private-practice rheumatologists (PPRs) was taken in 2009. Each physician included 2 consecutive patients with gout. Each patient was evaluated twice at an interval of 3-6months. Information on EULAR 2006 management modalities were collected in a standardized manner.\nRESULTS: Of 1003 patients, 771 were evaluated twice. Allopurinol was prescribed to 75.1% of patients in all and was initiated at the first study visit in 44 patients, among whom 19 (43.2%) 19 patients received the recommended starting dosage of 100mg\/day. Colchicine therapy to prevent flares was prescribed to 74.3% of patients. Of the 522 patients on allopurinol therapy at the first visit, only 34.5% had serum uric acid levels≤360μmoL\/L (mean dosage, 173 mg\/day). Excessive dietary intake by patients who were overweight or obese was recorded in 31.5% of patients seen by PCPs and in 19.7% of those seen by OBRs. This finding prompted the delivery of nutritional advice to 45.8% of patients. Discontinuation of excessive alcohol intake was recommended to only 10% of patients. Diuretic therapy discontinuation was feasible in 175 patients but was recommended in only 7 patients.\nCONCLUSION: Differences between practice patterns and 2006 EULAR recommendations were identified. Simplifying the recommendations and teaching them during medical training and continued medical education may deserve consideration.",

        "Abstract":"['n', 'n', 'P']\n['E', 'GLO', 'E,', 'GLO', 'E']\nHigher plasma uric acid (PUA) levels are associated with lower glomerular filtration rate (GFR) and higher blood pressure (BP) in patients with type 1 diabetes (T1D). Our aim was to determine the impact of PUA lowering on renal and vascular function in patients with uncomplicated T1D. T1D patients ( = 49) were studied under euglycemic and hyperglycemic conditions at baseline and after PUA lowering with febuxostat (FBX) for 8 weeks. Healthy control subjects were studied under normoglycemic conditions ( = 24). PUA, GFR (inulin), effective renal plasma flow (para-aminohippurate), BP, and hemodynamic responses to an infusion of angiotensin II (assessment of intrarenal renin-angiotensin-aldosterone system [RAAS]) were measured before and after FBX treatment. Arterial stiffness, flow-mediated dilation (FMD), nitroglycerin-mediated dilation (GMD), urinary nitric oxide (NO), and inflammatory markers were measured before and after FBX treatment. Gomez equations were used to estimate arteriolar afferent resistance, efferent resistance (R), and glomerular hydrostatic pressure (P). FBX had a modest systolic BP-lowering effect in T1D patients (112 ± 10 to 109 ± 9 mmHg,  = 0.049) without impacting arterial stiffness, FMD, GMD, or NO. FBX enhanced the filtration fraction response to hyperglycemia in T1D patients through larger increases in R P, and interleukin-18 but without impacting the RAAS. FBX lowered systolic BP and modulated the renal R responses to hyperglycemia but without impacting the RAAS or NO levels, suggesting that PUA may augment other hemodynamic or inflammatory mechanisms that control the renal response to hyperglycemia at the efferent arteriole. Ongoing outcome trials will determine cardiorenal outcomes of PUA lowering in patients with T1D.",

        "Abstract":"BACKGROUND: High blood pressure represents a major public health problem. Worldwide, approximately one-fourth of the adult population has hypertension. Epidemiological and experimental studies suggest a link between hyperuricemia and hypertension. Hyperuricemia affects 25% to 40 % of individuals with untreated hypertension; a much lower prevalence has been reported in normotensives or in the general population. However, whether lowering serum uric acid (UA) might lower blood pressure (BP) is an unanswered question.\nOBJECTIVES: To determine whether UA-lowering agents reduce BP in patients with primary hypertension or prehypertension compared with placebo.\nSEARCH METHODS: The Cochrane Hypertension Information Specialist searched the following databases for randomized controlled trials up to February 2016: the Cochrane Hypertension Specialised Register, the Cochrane Central Register of Controlled Trials (CENTRAL) (2016, Issue 2), MEDLINE (from 1946), Embase (from 1974), the World Health Organization International Clinical Trials Registry Platform, and ClinicalTrials.gov. We also searched LILACS up to March 2016 and contacted authors of relevant papers regarding further published and unpublished work.\nSELECTION CRITERIA: To be included in this review, the studies had to meet the following criteria: 1) randomized or quasi-randomized, with a group assigned to receive a UA-lowering agent and another group assigned to receive placebo; 2) double-blind, single-blind or open-label; 3) parallel or cross-over trial; 4) cross-over trials had to have a washout period of at least two weeks; 5) minimum treatment duration of four weeks; 6) participants had to have a diagnosis of essential hypertension or prehypertension, and hyperuricemia (serum UA greater than 6 mg\/dL in women, 7 mg\/dL in men and 5.5 mg\/dL in children\/adolescents); 7) outcome measures assessed included change in clinic systolic, diastolic or 24-hour ambulatory BP.\nDATA COLLECTION AND ANALYSIS: The two review authors independently collected the data using a data extraction form, and resolved any disagreements via discussion. We assessed risk of bias using the Cochrane Collaboration' Risk of bias' tool.\nMAIN RESULTS: In this review update, we examined the abstracts of 349 identified papers and selected 21 for evaluation. We also identified three ongoing studies, the results of which are not yet available. Three other randomized controlled trials (RCTs) (two new), enrolling individuals with hypertension or prehypertension, and hyperuricemia, met the inclusion criteria for the review and were included in the meta-analysis. Low quality of evidence from three RCTs indicate no reduction in systolic (MD -6.2 mmHg, 95% CI -12.8 to 0.5) or diastolic (-3.9 mmHg, 95% CI -9.2 to 1.4) 24-hour ambulatory BP with UA-lowering drugs compared with placebo. Low quality of evidence from two RCTs reveal a reduction of systolic clinic BP (-8.43 mmHg, 95% CI -15.24 to -1.62) but not diastolic clinic BP (-6.45 mmHg, 95% CI -13.60 to 0.70). High quality of evidence from three RCTs indicates that serum UA levels were reduced by 3.1 mg\/dL (95% CI 2.4 to 3.8) in the participants that received UA-lowering drugs. Very low quality of evidence from three RCTs suggests that withdrawals due to adverse effects were not increased with UA-lowering therapy (RR 1.86, 95% CI 0.43 to 8.10).\nAUTHORS' CONCLUSIONS: In this updated systematic review, the RCT data available at present are insufficient to know whether UA-lowering therapy also lowers BP. More studies are needed.",

        "Published":"2017-04-06",
        "Abstract":"Gout is caused by elevated serum urate levels, which can be treated using inhibitors of the uric acid transporter, URAT1. Here, we characterize verinurad (RDEA3170), which is currently under evaluation for gout therapy. Verinurad specifically inhibits URAT1 with a potency of 25 nM. High affinity inhibition of uric acid transport requires URAT1 residues Cys-32, Ser-35, Phe-365 and Ile-481. Unlike other available uricosuric agents, the requirement for Cys-32 is unique to verinurad. Two of these residues, Ser-35 and Phe-365, are also important for urate transport kinetics. A URAT1 binding assay using radiolabeled verinurad revealed that distinct URAT1 inhibitors benzbromarone, sulfinpyrazone and probenecid all inhibit verinurad binding via a competitive mechanism. However, mutations made within the predicted transporter substrate channel differentially altered the potency for individual URAT1 inhibitors. Overall, our results suggest that URAT1 inhibitors bind to a common site in the core of the transporter and sterically hinder the transit of uric acid through the substrate channel, albeit with vastly different potencies and with differential interactions with specific URAT1 amino acids.",

Eligible trials had to report CV safety of a ULT. Potential medications included allopurinol, febuxostat, pegloticase, rasburicase, probenecid, benzbromarone, sulphinpyrazone, losartan, fenofibrate and sodium-glucose linked transporter 2 inhibitors.\nRESULTS: A total of 3084 citations were found, with 642 duplicates. After the primary screen, 35 studies were selected for review. Several trials did not report CV events. Six were not randomized controlled trials (RCTs). Four studies reported no events in either intervention arm while the other four had 40 events in the febuxostat group ( n = 3631) and 5 in allopurinol group ( n = 1154). Overall, the pooled analysis did not show a significant difference between the two [febuxostat vs allopurinol: relative risk (RR) 1.69 (95% CI 0.54, 5.34), P = 0.37]. CV events did not decrease over time. Comparing shorter studies (<52 weeks) to longer ones did not reveal any statistical differences. However, in long-term studies with febuxostat vs allopurinol, results were nearly significant, with more CVE occurring with febuxostat treatment. Comparing any ULT to placebo (eight studies, n = 2221 patients) did not demonstrate a significant difference in non-Anti-Platelet Trialists' Collaboration events [any ULT vs placebo: RR 1.47 (95% CI 0.49, 4.40), P = 0.49] or all-cause mortality [any ULT vs placebo: RR 1.45 (95% CI 0.35, 5.77), P = 0.60].\nCONCLUSION: RCT data do not suggest differences in CV events among ULTs in gout. Trials had few events despite high-risk patients being enrolled and may have been too short to show CV reduction by controlling inflammatory attacks and lowering uric acid.",

        "Abstract":"Rasburicase is indicated for the prevention and treatment of tumor lysis syndrome which can be a potentially life-threatening emergency. The drug has oxidizing potential and as an adverse effect, it can convert the ferrous form of iron in erythrocytes to its ferric form resulting in the formation of methemoglobin which makes the heme component incapable of carrying oxygen. Patients with glucose-6-phosphate dehydrogenase enzyme deficiency are at high risk of methemoglobinemia from oxidizing agents. Symptoms of methemoglobinemia range from none to life-threatening hypoxemia, cyanosis and respiratory compromise. Treatment is indicated at levels above 20% and at lower levels if the patient is significantly anemic. We present a case of a 60-year-old male with diffuse large B cell lymphoma at high risk of tumor lysis syndrome. Rasburicase was administered to prevent renal failure and further rise in uric acid. Twenty-four hours later, a bedside pulse oximetry showed an oxygen saturation ranging from 60 to 65% with minimal cyanosis. Co-oximetry revealed a methemoglobin level of 9.8%. Methylene blue was administered and the methemoglobin level decreased to 2.6%. However, the patient developed hemolysis several hours later, likely secondary to rasburicase and methylene blue, requiring transfusion support. We discuss this potentially fatal and initially asymptomatic adverse effect of rasburicase along with diagnostic and treatment considerations, and review the cases described in the current literature.",

        "Abstract":"BACKGROUND: There are no published human studies investigating whether the use of allopurinol, the most commonly used medication for the treatment of hyperuricemia in gout, the most common type of inflammatory arthritis in adults, has any beneficial effects on ventricular electrophysiology. The objective of our study was to assess whether allopurinol use is associated with a reduction in the risk of ventricular arrhythmias (VA).\nMETHODS: We used the 5% random sample of Medicare beneficiaries from 2006-2012 to examine new allopurinol use and the risk of incident VA. Multivariable Cox regression analyses were adjusted for demographics (age, race, sex), comorbidity, cardiac medications, and conditions associated with VA. We calculated hazard ratios (HR) and 95% confidence intervals (CI).\nRESULTS: Of the 28,755 episodes of new allopurinol use, 2538 were associated with incident VA (8.8%). Among patients with incident VA, 54% were male, 78% were White, 75% had gout as the underlying diagnosis, and the mean Charlson-Romano comorbidity score was 4.8. The crude incidence of VA per 1,000,000 person-days declined as the duration of allopurinol use increased: 1-180 days, 151; 181 days to 2 years, 105; and > 2 years, 85. In multivariable-adjusted analyses, compared to non-use, allopurinol use was associated with lower HR of VA of 0.82 (95% CI, 0.76-0.90). Compared to allopurinol non-use, longer allopurinol use durations were significantly associated with lower multivariable-adjusted HR for VA: 1-180 days, 0.96 (95% CI, 0.85-1.08); 181 days to 2 years, 0.76 (95% CI, 0.68-0.85); and > 2 years, 0.72 (95% CI, 0.60-0.87). Multiple sensitivity analyses adjusting for cardiac conditions, anti-arrhythmic drugs and alternate definitions confirmed our findings with minimal\/no attenuation of estimates.\nCONCLUSION: Allopurinol use and use duration of more than 6 months were independently associated with a lower risk of VA. Future studies need to assess the pathophysiology of this potential benefit.",

        "Abstract":"BACKGROUND AND OBJECTIVES: Higher serum uric acid levels, even within the reference range, are strongly associated with increased activity of the renin-angiotensin system (RAS) and risk of incident hypertension. However, the effect of lowering serum uric acid on RAS activity in humans is unknown, although the data that lowering serum uric acid can reduce BP are conflicting.\nDESIGN, SETTING, PARTICIPANTS, & MEASUREMENTS: In a double-blind placebo-controlled trial conducted from 2011 to 2015, we randomly assigned 149 overweight or obese adults with serum uric acid ≥5.0 mg\/dl to uric acid lowering with either probenecid or allopurinol, or to placebo. The primary endpoints were kidney-specific and systemic RAS activity. Secondary endpoints included mean 24-hour systolic BP, mean awake and asleep BP, and nocturnal dipping.\nRESULTS: Allopurinol and probenecid markedly lowered serum uric acid after 4 and 8 weeks compared with placebo (mean serum uric acid in allopurinol, probenecid, and placebo at 8 weeks was 2.9, 3.5, and 5.6 mg\/dl, respectively). The change in kidney-specific RAS activity, measured as change in the median (interquartile range) renal plasma flow response to captopril (in ml\/min per 1.73 m) from baseline to 8 weeks, was -4 (-25 to 32) in the probenecid group (=0.83), -4 (-16 to 9) in the allopurinol group (=0.32), and 1 (-21 to 17) in the placebo group (=0.96), with no significant treatment effect (=0.77). Similarly, plasma renin activity and plasma angiotensin II levels did not significantly change with treatment. The change in mean (±SD) 24-hour systolic BPs from baseline to 8 weeks was -1.6±10.1 with probenecid (=0.43), -0.4±6.1 with allopurinol (=0.76), and 0.5±6.0 with placebo (=0.65); there was no significant treatment effect (=0.58). Adverse events occurred in 9%, 12%, and 2% of those given probenecid, allopurinol, or placebo, respectively.\nCONCLUSIONS: In contrast to animal experiments and observational studies, this randomized, placebo-controlled trial found that uric acid lowering had no effect on kidney-specific or systemic RAS activity after 8 weeks or on mean systolic BP. These data do not support the hypothesis that higher levels of uric acid are a reversible risk factor for increased BP.",

People with gout receiving at least creatinine clearance (CrCL)-based allopurinol dose for ≥1 month and SU ≥6 mg\/dL were recruited. Participants were randomised to continue current dose (control) or allopurinol dose escalation for 12 months. In the dose escalation group, allopurinol was increased monthly until SU was <6 mg\/dL. The primary endpoints were reduction in SU and adverse events (AEs).\nRESULTS: 183 participants (93 control, 90 dose escalation) were recruited. At baseline, mean (SD) urate was 7.15 (1.6) mg\/dL and allopurinol dose 269 mg\/day. 52% had CrCL<60 mL\/min. Mean changes in SU at the final visit were -0.34 mg\/dL in the control group and -1.5 mg\/dL in the dose escalation group (p<0.001) with a mean difference of 1.2 mg\/dL (95% CI 0.67 to 1.5, p<0.001). At month 12, 32% of controls and 69% in the dose escalation had SU <6 mg\/dL. There were 43 serious AEs in 25 controls and 35 events in 22 dose escalation participants. Only one was considered probably related to allopurinol. Five control and five dose escalation participants died; none was considered allopurinol related. Mild elevations in LFTs were common in both groups, a few moderate increases in gamma glutamyl transferase (GGT) were noted. There was no difference in renal function changes between randomised groups.\nCONCLUSIONS: Higher than CrCL-based doses of allopurinol can effectively lower SU to treatment target in most people with gout.

        "Abstract":"Potassium oxonate, a selectively competitive uricase inhibitor, produced hyperuricemia (HUA) in rodents in a previous study. In this study, we employed the tree shrew as an animal model to study potassium oxonate-induced HUA. The effect of allopurinol (ALLO), a uric acid reducer, was also examined in this model. Potassium oxonate at doses of 5, 20, 40, 60, 80, 100, and 1,000 mg\/kg was given intraperitoneally to tree shrews. The results showed that potassium oxonate can effectively increase the levels of uric acid in tree shrews at doses ranging from 40 to 100 mg\/kg. Semiquantitative RT-PCR showed that the xanthine dehydrogenase\/oxidase (XDH\/XO) mRNA expression level was significantly higher in the liver tissue of tree shrews with high levels of uric acid. There were no changes in serum urea nitrogen, or serum creatinine values. ALLO can significantly decrease serum uric acid levels (P<0.01) and raise XDH\/XO mRNA expression levels in the liver tissue of tree shrews with HUA. XDH\/XO mRNA expression levels did not change in untreated tree shrews. Studies on acute toxicity in the tree shrew did not show any significantly abnormal signs. There were no adverse effects at the macroscopic level up to doses ≤100 mg\/kg. Potassium oxonate induced acute HUA in tree shrews at lower doses compared with other animal models. Potassium oxonate-treated tree shrews may be a potential animal model for studying pathogenic mechanism and evaluating a new therapeutic agent for treatment of HUA in humans.",

Of 1332 study participants, 1222 (91.7%) had CKD; the median eGFR was 20.8 ml\/min per 1.73 m (25th, 75th percentiles: 9.0, 35.4 ml\/min per 1.73 m). Forty-one of the participants had febuxostat-associated myopathy (3.2%). All patients with myopathy had CKD, and the incident rate was 0.013 (95% confidence interval, 0.01 to 0.02) events per 100 patient-days in patients with CKD. Of 41 patients with myopathy, 37 had myositis, and four had rhabdomyolysis. Myopathy resolved in 17 patients who withdrew from treatment and eight patients who continued febuxostat treatment. Among the evaluated predictors, multivariate analysis showed that only the lowest eGFR tertile was significantly associated with myopathy in febuxostat users. The odds ratio of the lowest eGFR tertile to the highest tertile was 4.21 (95% confidence interval, 1.7 to 10.43). This finding remained consistent among subgroups stratified by age, sex, diabetes status, coronary artery disease, and statin or fibrate use.\nCONCLUSIONS: Patients with severely reduced eGFR had higher risk of myopathy with treatment of febuxostat. Regular monitoring of creatine kinase level is suggested for early detection of febuxostat-associated myopathy, particularly in patients with CKD.",

We treated 139 and 71 patients with CoTOL and the placebo, respectively, and evaluated their sUA levels, acute gouty arthritis recurrence rate, and adverse events at week 0, 6, and 12.\nRESULTS: Twenty-five and 12 patients in the treatment and control groups, respectively, had interrupted treatments, whereas 114 and 59 cases, respectively, completed their treatments. At the end of the 12-week treatment, the average decrease in sUA was 74.26 (95% confidence interval [CI]: 56.74-91.77 μmol\/L) and 28.81 μmol\/L (95% CI: 4.91-52.71 μmol\/L) in the treatment and control groups, respectively (P = 0.004). The average decrease rate of sUA was 12.76% (95% CI: 9.82%-15.70%) and 4.57% (95% CI: 0.42%-8.71%) in the treatment and control groups, respectively (P = 0.004), and the gouty arthritis recurrence rate of the treatment group was lower than that of the control group (from week 6 to 12, 21.93% and 50.88% in the treatment and control group, respectively, P < 0.001; from baseline to week 12, 38.5% and 63.16%, respectively, P = 0.003).

        "Abstract":"Among a broad spectrum of medical treatments, protein therapeutics holds tremendous opportunities for the treatment of metabolic disorders, cancer, autoimmune diseases and etc. Broad adaption of protein therapeutics, however, still remain challenging, not only because of poor protein stability, but they also experience fast clearance after administrated and elicit immune responses, resulting in undesirable biodistribution and short blood residence time. In this study, we demonstrate a novel protein delivery method via encapsulating therapeutic proteins within thin shells of poly(N-vinylpyrrolidone) (PVP), which leads to significantly improved protein stability, reduced macrophage uptake, prolonged circulation time and reduced immunogenicity. Exemplified with urate oxidase (UOx), the enzyme used for hyperuricemia treatment, as-formed UOx nanocapsules, n(UOx), exhibits enhanced stability, more significant therapeutic effects, and a more than 10-fold improvement in circulation time when compared with native UOx. This technology not only demonstrates the use of UOx nanocapsules for hyperuricemia management, but also provides a general approach for a broad spectrum of therapeutic proteins for in vivo applications.",

        "Abstract":"OBJECTIVES: The goals of our study are to evaluate the urate-lowering therapy (ULT) effect on gout ultrasound (US) lesions and to explore US sensitivity to change in gout patients.\nMETHODS: Patients with chronic and symptomatic gout, confirmed by crystal identification, were prospectively included. Clinical and US assessments were performed at baseline and after 6, 12 and 24 months of ULT. The presence of double contour sign (DCS) and US- detectable tophi were assessed in the first metatarsophalangeals, the knees and patellar tendons. The mean and standard deviation were calculated for each parameter. The correlation between the clinical and US parameters was assessed by calculating Pearson's correlation coefficient. Sensitivity to change in the US examinations was assessed by estimating the smallest detectable difference (SDD).\nRESULTS: Twenty-three consecutive patients were included (96% men; mean age 59 ± 11 years). DCS and US tophi were detected in 73.9% and 91.3% of patients at baseline. A significant parallel improvement in the serum urate, clinical parameters and US lesions was found at the follow-up assessment. The SDD values for the global DCS and tophi were 0.52 and 0.69, respectively, which were smaller than the differences achieved over the course of the two years. A significant correlation between DCS and clinical parameters was observed (r =0.49, p=0.038).\nCONCLUSIONS: Ultrasound findings in gout patients show sensitivity to change and concurrent validity with uric acid reduction after ULT in gout patients.

        "Abstract":"BACKGROUND: Tumour lysis syndrome (TLS) is a serious complication of malignancies and can result in renal failure or death. Previous reviews did not find clear evidence of benefit of urate oxidase in children with cancer. This review is the second update of a previously published Cochrane review.\nOBJECTIVES: To assess the effects and safety of urate oxidase for the prevention and treatment of TLS in children with malignancies.\nSEARCH METHODS: In March 2016 we searched CENTRAL, MEDLINE, Embase, and CINAHL. In addition, we searched the reference lists of all identified relevant papers, trials registers and other databases. We also screened conference proceedings and we contacted experts in the field and the manufacturer of rasburicase, Sanofi-aventis.\nSELECTION CRITERIA: Randomised controlled trials (RCT) and controlled clinical trials (CCT) of urate oxidase for the prevention or treatment of TLS in children under 18 years with any malignancy.\nDATA COLLECTION AND ANALYSIS: Two review authors independently extracted trial data and assessed individual trial quality. We used risk ratios (RR) for dichotomous data and mean difference (MD) for continuous data.\nMAIN RESULTS: We included seven trials, involving 471 participants in the treatment groups and 603 participants in the control groups. No new studies were identified in the update. One RCT and five CCTs compared urate oxidase and allopurinol. Three trials tested Uricozyme, and three trials tested rasburicase for the prevention of TLS.The RCT did not evaluate the primary outcome (incidence of clinical TLS). It showed no clear evidence of a difference in mortality (both all-cause mortality (Fisher's exact test P = 0.23) and mortality due to TLS (no deaths in either group)), renal failure (Fisher's exact test P = 0.46), and adverse effects between the treatment and the control groups (Fisher's exact test P = 1.0). The frequency of normalisation of uric acid at four hours (10 out of 10 participants in the treatment group versus zero out of nine participants in the control group, Fisher's exact test P < 0.001) and area under the curve of uric acid at four days (MD -201.00 mg\/dLhr, 95% CI -258.05 mg\/dLhr to -143.95 mg\/dLhr; P < 0.00001) were significantly better in the treatment group.One CCT evaluated the primary outcome; no clear evidence of a difference was identified between the treatment and the control groups (RR 0.77, 95% CI 0.44 to 1.33; P = 0.34). Pooled results of three CCTs showed significantly lower mortality due to TLS in the treatment group (RR 0.05, 95% CI 0.00 to 0.89; P = 0.04); no clear evidence of a difference in all-cause mortality was identified between the groups (RR 0.19, 95% CI 0.01 to 3.42; P = 0.26). Pooled results from five CCTs showed significantly lower incidence of renal failure in the treatment group (RR 0.26, 95% CI 0.08 to 0.89; P = 0.03). Results of CCTs also showed significantly lower uric acid in the treatment group at two days (three CCTs: MD -3.80 mg\/dL, 95% CI -7.37 mg\/dL to -0.24 mg\/dL; P = 0.04), three days (two CCTs: MD -3.13 mg\/dL, 95% CI -6.12 mg\/dL to -0.14 mg\/dL; P = 0.04), four days (two CCTs: MD -4.60 mg\/dL, 95% CI -6.39 mg\/dL to -2.81 mg\/dL; P < 0.00001), and seven days (one CCT: MD -1.74 mg\/dL, 95% CI -3.01 mg\/dL to -0.47 mg\/dL; P = 0.007) after therapy, but not one day (three CCTs: MD -3.00 mg\/dL, 95% CI -7.61 mg\/dL to 1.60 mg\/dL; P = 0.2), five days (one CCT: MD -1.02 mg\/dL, 95% CI -2.24 mg\/dL to 0.20 mg\/dL; P = 0.1), and 12 days (one CCT: MD -0.80 mg\/dL, 95% CI -2.51 mg\/dL to 0.91 mg\/dL; P = 0.36) after therapy. Pooled results from three CCTs showed higher frequency of adverse effects in participants who received urate oxidase (RR 9.10, 95% CI 1.29 to 64.00; P = 0.03).Another included RCT, with 30 participants, compared different doses of rasburicase (0.2 mg\/kg versus 0.15 mg\/kg). The primary outcome was not evaluated. No clear evidence of a difference in mortality (all-cause mortality (Fisher's exact test P = 1.0) and mortality due to TLS (no deaths in both groups)) and renal failure (no renal failure in both groups) was identified. It demonstrated no clear evidence of a difference in uric acid normalisation (RR 1.07, 95% CI 0.89 to 1.28; P = 0.49) and uric acid level at four hours (MD 8.10%, 95% CI -0.99% to 17.19%; P = 0.08). Common adverse events of urate oxidase included hypersensitivity, haemolysis, and anaemia, but no clear evidence of a difference between treatment groups was identified (RR 0.54, 95% CI 0.12 to 2.48; P = 0.42).The quality of evidence ranks from very low to low because of imprecise results, and all included trials were highly susceptible to biases.\nAUTHORS' CONCLUSIONS: Although urate oxidase might be effective in reducing serum uric acid, it is unclear whether it reduces clinical TLS, renal failure, or mortality. Adverse effects might be more common for urate oxidase compared with allopurinol. Clinicians should weigh the potential benefits of reducing uric acid and uncertain benefits of preventing mortality or renal failure from TLS against the potential risk of adverse effects.",

Despite clinical cure being achievable and multiple evidence-based guidelines having been published, the incidence and prevalence continues to increase and the condition remains undertreated. Concerns regarding allopurinol have limited its use in those with renal impairment. Febuxostat, a novel xanthine oxidase inhibitor requiring no dose adjustment in mild-moderate renal impairment was launched in the United Kingdom (UK) in 2010. We review published data on the efficacy, safety and tolerability of febuxostat and provide an opinion on its place in the management of gout in the UK in the context of other published guidelines. One phase II trial, multiple phase III trials [febuxostat  allopurinol controlled trial (FACT), APEX, CONFIRMS] and two open-label extension trials have demonstrated febuxostat given at the doses commonly used in UK practice (80 mg, 120 mg) to reduce serum urate more effectively than those receiving fixed-dose allopurinol. Overall adverse event rates were comparable across treatment groups aside from gout flare (more common in febuxostat-treated patients) and concerns regarding cardiovascular toxicity are being further evaluated in two large trials. If the outcomes of these are favourable, we would anticipate a marked increase in the use of febuxostat in the UK market. We would advocate the use of febuxostat to target a serum urate < 0.3 mmol\/l (5 mg\/dl) as a second-line urate-lowering therapy in patients with hyperuricaemia, and clinical gout in those intolerant of allopurinol, or in those in whose renal function precludes optimal dose escalation to achieve target serum urate. We would advise prophylaxis against gouty flare with colchicine, nonsteroidal anti-inflammatory drugs (NSAIDs), or Cyclo-oxygenase-2 selective NSAID (COXIB) after febuxostat initiation.",

        "Abstract":"Adverse reactions are one of the most important issues in drug development, as well as in the therapeutic usage of drugs during the post-approval stage. Specifically, idiosyncratic adverse drug reactions (IDR) occur in only a small group of patients who are treated with certain drugs, and are unpredictable. It is widely accepted that drug-induced IDR is often associated with CYP-mediated bioactivation. Benzbromarone (BBR) is effective in the treatment of hyperuricemia, and has been used as an effective drug in Japan for a long time. However, BBR has been associated with hepatotoxicity, including fatal liver injury. We identified 2,6-dibromohydroquinone (DBH) and mono-debrominated catechol (CAT) as novel metabolites of BBR in human and rat liver microsomal systems, by comparison with chemically synthesized authentic compounds via ipso-substitution, which we previously discovered to be a unique metabolic reaction of substituted phenols by CYP. Furthermore, CAT, DBH and the oxidized form of DBH (DBBQ) were highly cytotoxic in human hepatocellular carcinoma cells, compared with BBR. We consider that the formation of these metabolites from BBR is linked to the mechanism involved in BBR-induced hepatotoxicity because catechols, hydroquinones, and their oxidized forms are known to be toxic.",

        "Abstract":"The treatment of gout is based on several principles. Symptom control and termination of the inflammatory process are important early goals, whereas the urate level should be lowered in the long term to prevent further gout attacks and complications. The non-pharmacological approach is based on individually informing the patient on dietary measures and changes of life style. Besides physical measures, such as cold applications on the affected joint, various medications are available for treatment of an acute gout attack. The choice of drug depends on the individual risk profile. If non-steroidal anti-inflammatory drugs (NSAID) and coxibs are chosen it should be taken into account that the use is restricted in patients with renal insufficiency. Moreover, these drugs may have gastrointestinal side effects and are associated with increased cardiovascular morbidity and mortality. Colchicine has gastrointestinal side effects at high dosages but can also be used for differential diagnostics if there is a quick response to treatment. Steroids are an effective alternative and can be given orally or parenterally in patients with dysphagia. Moreover, steroids can be used in cases of renal insufficiency. After symptoms of the acute attack have subsided, urate lowering therapy should be initiated to prevent further attacks. Low-dose urate lowering therapy can be started during an acute gout attack when acute therapy is initiated. Allopurinol is still the medication of choice but its use is restricted in patients with renal insufficiency. A rare but serious side effect is allopurinol hypersensitivity syndrome. Febuxostat can be an alternative in patients who do not tolerate allopurinol. In February 2016, lesinurad, an URAT-1 and OAT-4 inhibitor, was approved in combination with allopurinol or febuxostat. Data on the effectiveness and safety of synthetic uricases and biologicals are still sparse for elderly patients. These substances are reserved for severe cases of gout.",

        "Abstract":"Several studies suggest that chronic hyperuricemia, the main precursor of gout, is involved in the pathogenesis of different systemic disorders that affect cardiovascular and renal systems, such as hypertension, obesity, hypercholesterolemia, atherosclerosis, metabolic syndrome, chronic heart failure, and chronic kidney disease. Recent epidemiological evidence has shown an increasing trend in the prevalence of hyperuricemia and gout in the Western world: a number of population-based studies estimate a prevalence of up to 21% for hyperuricemia and 1%-4% for gout. As such, early detection and careful management of this pathological condition is required, starting from lifestyle changes (mainly based on a diet low in red meat, sugars, and alcoholic beverages, with increased intake of vegetables, water, and vitamin C sources), adding specific drugs to lead serum uric acid (SUA) levels under the target value of 7 mg\/dL. In particular, nonselective and selective XO inhibitors (allopurinol, oxypurinol, febuxostat) reduce SUA levels and the overproduction of reactive oxygen species, mainly related to XO overactivity that often causes inflammatory damage to the vascular endothelium. The effect of lowering SUA levels via XO inhibition includes an attenuation of oxidative stress and related endothelial dysfunction that largely contribute to the pathophysiology of metabolic syndrome and cardiovascular diseases. Therefore, the inhibition of XO overactivation seems to be an excellent therapeutic option to limit the harmful effects of excess UA and reactive oxygen species. In conclusion, rapid diagnosis and correct therapy for hyperuricemia may also improve the prevention and\/or treatment of serious and multifactorial diseases. The available evidence supports the importance of promoting new experimental clinical trials to confirm the emerging antioxidant role of XO inhibitors, which could effectively contribute to cardiovascular and chronic kidney disease prevention.",

        "Abstract":"BACKGROUND: The effect of gout on the risk of developing coronary artery disease (CAD) is uncertain. Some studies have found that gout is a risk factor for acute myocardial infarction. This study examined the changes in risk of CAD in gout patients taking allopurinol and\/or benzbromarone, and analyzed the dose-response relationship of both drugs with CAD incidence.\nMETHODS: The medical records of one million subjects from 2000 to 2011 were provided by the Taiwan National Health Insurance Research Database. Cox proportional hazard ratio was used to compare the risk of CAD in gout patients taking allopurinol or\/and benzbromarone with those taking neither drug. Hazard ratios (HR) were adjusted for possible confounding factors, including age, gender, hypertension, hyperlipidemia, diabetes mellitus, chronic kidney disease, and relevant medications.\nRESULTS: Of 8047 gout patients, 1422 were treated with allopurinol (Group A), 4141 with benzbromarone (Group B), and 2484 with both drugs (Group A\/B) during the follow-up period. Our results showed the incidence of CAD after adjusting for covariates for Group A, Group B, and Group A\/B did not significantly differ from the comparison group. However, after adjustment for covariates in dose-response analyses, treatment with over 270 defined daily doses (DDDs) of allopurinol, and over 360 DDDs of benzbromarone, was associated with a significantly reduced risk of CAD.\nCONCLUSION: We found that the use of allopurinol and benzbromarone, whether alone or in combination, had a linear dose-response relationship between the numbers of defined daily doses and the risk of CAD, especially in higher DDDs.",

        "Abstract":"Gout is a metabolic disorder that usually presents as recurrent episodes of acute arthritis due to deposition of crystals in joints and cartilages. Despite the availability of several drugs for gout, its management is still less than adequate. There is always a search for newer, safer, and more potent urate-lowering therapies for treating patients inadequately controlled with available drugs. Lesinurad in combination with a xanthine oxidase inhibitor provides an effective mode of therapy in the management of hyperuricemia associated with gout. Lesinurad is a selective uric acid transporter 1 (URAT1) inhibitor. URAT1 is responsible for the majority of uric acid absorption from kidneys to the circulation. Lesinurad was granted marketing approval based on three randomized, double-blind, placebo-controlled; phase III clinical trials. It is devoid of interaction with organic anion transporters (OATs) such as OAT1 and 3, responsible for drug-drug interactions, an undesirable property associated with probenecid. On-going research is more focused on reducing inflammation consequent to deposition of crystals rather than production and excretion of urate. Various targets are being explored, and interleukin-1 beta inhibition seems to be one of the most promising approaches.",

        "Abstract":"BACKGROUND: Gout is the most common inflammatory arthritic disease and is caused by crystal deposition secondary to persistent hyperuricemia. Etiological treatment with urate-lowering therapy (ULT) has been available since the 1950s but previous studies have demonstrated suboptimal degree of treatment. In recent years we have seen recommendations for ULT earlier in the course of the disease, but there are few contemporary reports reflecting the current situation. Therefore we set out to investigate proportion receiving and persisting with ULT after gout diagnosis and predictors thereof.\nMETHOD: A population-based cohort study using regional and national population-based registers. Cohort of patients (n = 7709) from western Sweden with incident gout aged 18 years and above from 2011 to 2013. An incident case of gout was defined as having been given a diagnosis of gout (ICD-10 M10, M14.0-14.1) not preceded by a gout diagnosis or a dispensation of ULT during the previous 5 years. Main outcome measures were cumulative incidence and predictors for start of, and persistence with, ULT in gout.\nRESULTS: Within the first year after first gout diagnosis, 32% received ULT. Male sex, presence of diabetes or cardiovascular comorbidity, reduced kidney function but not diagnosed \"end-stage kidney failure\" increased the likelihood of receiving ULT. Of those starting ULT a majority (75%) did not persist with ULT treatment within the first 2 years. Age <50 years, lack of comorbidities, and \"normal kidney function\" or \"end-stage kidney failure\" were associated with non-persistence with ULT.\nCONCLUSIONS: Only a minority of patients received ULT and a majority of these did not persist with treatment over the next 2 years. However, the older patients with renal impairment and comorbidities, possibly suffering from a more severe gout disease, were more likely to receive and persist with treatment. There is thus still room for considerable improvement with regards to management of ULT in gout.",

Gout treatment includes rapid initiation of anti-inflammatory medications for acute attacks and chronically treating with urate lowering drugs as well as chronic anti-inflammatory prophylaxis. Areas covered: This review aims to provide an overview and discussion of the safety concerns of current treatment options available for gout. Expert opinion: Gout is a curable disease with appropriate treatment. The advent of new therapies provides encouraging opportunities to improve gout management. However, clinicians should be aware of some of the safety concerns of medications used to treat acute and chronic gout. When prescribing medications for gout one has to be mindful of the presence of comorbidities commonly affecting gout patients that may affect drug safety and efficacy, especially in the elderly and in patients treated with multiple drugs. The benefits of gout drugs, usually, outweigh their safety concerns. Studies are needed in gout patients with chronic kidney disease and\/or cardiovascular disease, so that escalation of dosing \/combination of anti-inflammatory drugs needed to suppress gouty inflammation as well as escalation of dosing\/combination of urate lowering drugs needed to achieve target serum urate level will lead to better understanding of gout treatment safety issues.",

        "Abstract":"OBJECTIVE: To investigate the therapeutic effect of allopurinol treatment on acute coronary syndrome and to elucidate its possible mechanism.\nMETHODS: Patients with acute coronary syndrome (n = 100) were recruited as research subjects in our hospital. The patients were randomly divided into two groups, an allopurinol group (n = 50) and a control group (n = 50). These two groups were treated with conventional antiplatelet, anticoagulation and anti-ischemic therapy; allopurinol therapy was added to the allopurinol group based on conventional treatment indications. Biochemical markers such as serum creatinine, uric acid, BNP, blood glucose and blood lipid were compared between the two groups. Indicators of oxidative stress and inflammatory response (MDA, OX-LDL, NO, hs-CRP and TNF-α), as well as cardiovascular events during 2-years follow-up, were recorded.\nRESULTS: On admission, there was no difference in serum creatinine, uric acid, BNP, blood glucose or lipid levels between the two groups (P > 0.05). However, after 1 month of treatment, these levels were improved in patients in the allopurinol group compared to the control group (P < 0.05). MDA, OX-LDL, hs-CRP and TNF-α decreased after treatment periods of 14 days and 1 month. They were also decreased at 3 month, 6 month, 1 year, and 2 year follow-up visits. However, data from the allopurinol group demonstrated significantly lower levels than in the control group (P < 0.05). Additionally, compared with the control group, allopurinol treatment significantly elevated the level of NO (P < 0.05). The total effective rates of the allopurinol group are much higher than in the control group for both angina pectoris (93.2% and 76%, respectively) and ECG (96% and 82%, respectively). Most patients in the allopurinol group (n = 40) and the control group (n = 41) received stent implantation with no significant difference shown between them. The incidence of cardiovascular events during 2 years of follow-up in the allopurinol group was 10%; it was 30% in the control group.\nCONCLUSION: Allopurinol has a remarkable effect in the treatment of ACS and can improve the oxidative stress and inflammatory reaction indicators of patients. The protective mechanism of allopurinol might be achieved by suppressing the secretion and release of inflammatory mediators such as TNF-α, hs-CRP, OX-LDL and MDA while increasing levels of NO.",

        "Published":"2017-01-11",
        "Abstract":"PURPOSE: This article outlines several important issues regarding the management of patients with gout. The topics discussed include best practices for gout based on the most current guidelines, opportunities for improving gout management, and current and emerging therapies for gout.\nMETHODS: [PubMed and Google Scholar databases] were search for all articles and trials published before 2016, using the key terms [hyperuricemia, gout, tophi, joint erosion, joint damage, treatment guidelines, American College of Rheumatology (ACR), European League Against Rheumatism (EULAR), flare, comorbidity, epidemiology, adherence, serum uric acid (sUA), monosodium urate (MSU), <6 mg\/dL, MSU crystal formation, as well as individual drug names and classes of treatments of interest (allopurinol, febuxostat, colchicine, non-steroidal anti-inflammatories (NSAIDs)]. Studies were selected that presented data on gout treatment, including drugs under development, and on the management of gout from both the physician and patient perspectives. The reference lists of identified articles were searched manually for additional publications.\nFINDINGS: Gout, a progressive debilitating form of inflammatory arthritis, is caused by factors that elevate serum uric acid (sUA) levels, leading to hyperuricemia. Continued elevated sUA can result in monosodium urate crystal deposition in joints and soft tissues, causing acute and chronic inflammation. Crystal deposition can lead to chronic gout, with an increased number of flares, tophi development, and structural joint damage. The aims of gout treatment are to reduce the sUA level to <6 mg\/dL, to inhibit the formation of new crystals, and to promote the dissolution of existing crystals. Gout is often poorly managed for several reasons, including a lack of adherence to treatment guidelines by health care providers, patients' poor adherence to therapy, and differences between a provider's and patient's perspectives regarding treatment.\nIMPLICATIONS: Patients need to be educated about their diagnosis and management of the disease, such as the importance of compliance with long-term treatment. Gout treatment may also confounded by contraindications to current standards of therapy and the limitations of current treatment paradigms. Recently approved medications, as well as drugs under development, may provide new ways for reaching the sUA target and also \"curing\" the disease.",

The primary objective of this study was to evaluate and characterize outcomes resulting from an institution-specific guideline emphasizing supportive care, xanthine oxidase inhibitors, and lower doses of rasburicase. Methods In this retrospective chart review, we compared conservative rasburicase dosing, in accordance with newly developed UMHS tumor lysis syndrome guidelines, with aggressive rasburicase in adult patients (≥ 18 years of age) with hematological or solid tumor malignancies, and a uric acid level between 8 and 15 mg\/dL. The primary efficacy outcome assessed the difference in the proportion of patients achieving a uric acid level <8 mg\/dL within 48 h using a one-sided noninferiority test. The principle safety outcomes analyzed included incidence of acute kidney injury and hemodialysis requirement. Results One hundred sixty-one patients met inclusion criteria and were included in the study. Within 48 h of an elevated uric acid level, treatment was successful in 97.03% of patients in the conservative group, as compared with 98.33% in the aggressive group (difference, 1.3 percentage points; 95% confidence interval [CI], -3.33 to 5.93). Furthermore, there was no difference in the proportion of patients requiring hemodialysis (2.97% vs. 10.0%, p-value 0.079), or incidence of acute kidney injury (4.0% vs. 12.5%, p-value 1.00) between the treatment group and control group, respectively.

Topiroxostat, a selective xanthine oxidase inhibitor, effectively reduces serum uric acid (UA) levels and urinary albumin excretion (UAE) in CKD patients. A 50-year-old Japanese man was referred to our hospital due to albuminuria and hyperuricemia, and renal biopsy showed a typical hyperuricemic arteriolopathy. Treatment with topiroxostat decreased serum UA levels (9.2 mg\/dL at baseline to 6.4 mg\/dL after 6 months), UAE (388 to 88 mg\/g.cr), and urinary level of liver-type fatty acid-binding protein (28.8 to 19.8 µg\/g.cr). Interestingly, topiroxostat treatment was associated with a trend towards improved flow-mediated dilation (5.4 to 5.8%).

We estimated the prevalence, incidence, prescription patterns, and comorbidity burden of gout in an entire Canadian province [British Columbia (BC)] over the last decade.\nMETHODS: We utilized PopulationData BC, a province-wide database, to estimate temporal trends in the prevalence and incidence of gout from 2000 to 2012, as well as according to age category. Annual estimates were age-sex-standardized using 2012 as the reference. We also examined annual trends in prescription patterns of common gout medications and assessed the comorbidity burden among gout patients in 2012.\nRESULTS: The 2012 prevalence of gout was 3.8% among the overall population, and the incidence rate was 2.9 per 1000 person-years. Both gout prevalence and incidence increased substantially over the study period. This burden additionally increased according to age category, affecting over 8% of those ages 60-69 years in 2012. Approximately 22% of gout patients received a prescription for urate-lowering therapy (ULT), which remained stable over the study period, while colchicine and oral glucocorticoid use both increased modestly. By 2012, 72%, 52%, and 18% of prevalent gout patients had been diagnosed with hypertension, hyperlipidemia, and diabetes, respectively.\nCONCLUSIONS: The burden of gout in BC, Canada, is substantial, and both the prevalence and incidence have increased over the past decade, while prescription of ULT remains low.

Mean serum uric acid levels significantly decreased in the probenecid (from 6.1 to 3.5 mg\/dL) and allopurinol groups (from 6.1 to 2.9 mg\/dL) but not in the placebo group (6.1 to 5.6 mg\/dL). None of the interventions produced any significant change in endothelium-dependent vasodilation (probenecid, 7.4±5.1% at baseline and 8.3±5.1% at 8 weeks; allopurinol, 7.6±6.0% at baseline and 6.2±4.8% at 8 weeks; and placebo, 6.5±3.8% at baseline and 7.1±4.9% at 8 weeks). In this randomized, double-blind, placebo-controlled trial, uric acid lowering did not affect endothelial function in overweight or obese nonhypertensive individuals. These data do not support the hypothesis that uric acid is causally related to endothelial dysfunction, a potential mechanism for development of hypertension.",

        "Abstract":"Humans and higher primates are unique in that they lack uricase, the enzyme capable of oxidizing uric acid. As a consequence of this enzyme deficiency, humans have high serum uric acid levels. In some people, uric acid levels rise above the solubility limit resulting in crystallization in joints, acute inflammation in response to those crystals causes severe pain; a condition known as gout. Treatment for severe gout includes injection of non-human uricase to reduce serum uric acid levels. Krystexxa® is a hyper-PEGylated pig-baboon chimeric uricase indicated for chronic refractory gout that induces an immunogenic response in 91% of treated patients, including infusion reactions (26%) and anaphylaxis (6.5%). These properties limit its use and effectiveness. An innovative approach has been used to develop a therapeutic uricase with improved properties such as: soluble expression, neutral pH solubility, high E. coli expression level, thermal stability, and excellent activity. More than 200 diverse uricase sequences were aligned to guide protein engineering and reduce putative sequence liabilities. A single uricase lead candidate was identified, which showed low potential for immunogenicity in >200 human donor samples selected to represent diverse HLA haplotypes. Cysteines were engineered into the lead sequence for site specific PEGylation and studies demonstrated >95% PEGylation efficiency. PEGylated uricase retains enzymatic activity in vitro at neutral pH, in human serum and in vivo (rats and canines) and has an extended half-life. In canines, an 85% reduction in serum uric acid levels was observed with a single subcutaneous injection. This PEGylated, non-immunogenic uricase has the potential to provide meaningful benefits to patients with gout.",

        "Abstract":"BACKGROUND: Hyperuricemia is associated with development of gout, hypertension, and renal disease. The impact of allopurinol, a urate-lowering therapy, on renal function is unclear, especially in patients with chronic kidney disease who are at higher risk of hypersensitivity reaction.\nOBJECTIVES: The aim of this study was to determine the effect of allopurinol on kidney function in hyperuricemic male veterans.\nMETHODS: This is a retrospective cohort study using pharmacy, medical, and laboratory records of veterans enrolled at the Veterans Administration New York Harbor Healthcare System, Brooklyn campus. Fifty patients with hyperuricemia defined as a serum uric acid greater than 7 mg\/dL (average of ~9 mg\/dL), newly started on allopurinol for any reason, with evidence of treatment compliance, were matched by age, race, sex, and estimated glomerular filtration rate (EGFR) to 50 hyperuricemic control subjects. The retrospective cases were observed from October 2000 until November 2006, at which time there was a change in the laboratory analyzer, making further comparisons inappropriate.\nRESULTS: On average, patients treated with a mean 221 (SD, 96) mg\/d dose of allopurinol achieved 11.9 mL\/min higher GFR (95% confidence interval, 4.8-11.9 mg\/d dose; P = 0.01) than did the control group. Treatment effect was found to depend on the initial EGFR, as indicated by the significant treatment by initial EGFR interaction (P = 0.004) and increased with a higher initial EGFR. The allopurinol-treated group had a 0.10 mg\/dL lower final creatinine level (95% confidence interval, 0.003-0.20 mg\/dL; P = 0.04) than did the control subjects, adjusted for initial creatinine and age. The average length of follow-up was 3.4 years. There were 5 mild adverse events in the treated cases.\nCONCLUSIONS: Treatment of hyperuricemic patients with allopurinol over an average of 3.4 years resulted in a significant improvement of kidney function in this male cohort from the Veterans Administration Healthcare System. Clinicians should consider this potential benefit of allopurinol in the treatment of patients with hyperuricemia, those with overall maintained renal function.",

ARH plus febuxostat (FBX) were evaluated in subjects with gout for serum uric acid (SUA) lowering, drug interaction, and safety.\nMETHODS: Open phase II trial in gout volunteers (NCT02252835). Cohort 1 received ARH 600 mg for 2 weeks, followed by sequential 1-week co-administration of FBX 80 mg followed by 40 mg. FBX 40 mg was continued alone for 2 weeks. Cohort 2 received ARH 800 mg for 2 weeks, followed by sequential 1-week co-administration of FBX 40 mg followed by 80 mg. FBX 80 mg was continued alone for 2 weeks. SUA, its fractional excretion (FEUA), and plasma oxypurines were assessed. Pharmacokinetics of FBX and ARH were determined alone and in combination for cohort 2.\nRESULTS: Baseline mean SUA was 9.4 mg\/dl for cohort 1 (n = 16) and 9.2 mg\/dl for cohort 2 (n = 16). The largest SUA decrease (63%) was observed with ARH 800 mg + FBX 80 mg, with all subjects reaching SUA < 6 mg\/dl and 93% < 5 mg\/dl. The area under the curve (AUC) of ARH acid + FBX\/ARH acid was 108%. The AUC of FBX + ARH acid\/FBX was 87%. As expected, FBX increased oxypurines and increases were unaffected by ARH co-administration. Baseline FEUA were low (3.5%-4.6%) and ARH increased them toward normal without overexcretion of UA.

Each rasburicase-treated patient was propensity score-matched with 4 allopurinol-treated patients. Mean changes in UA within ≤ 2 days of treatment initiation were determined. Economic outcomes included mean number of days in the intensive care unit (ICU), total LOS, costs\/hospitalization, and costs\/percentage change in UA.\nRESULTS: Twenty-six rasburicase-treated patients were matched with 104 allopurinol-treated patients. Reduction in plasma UA was 5.3 mg\/dL greater for patients treated with rasburicase than for patients treated with allopurinol (P < .0001). Length of ICU stay was 2.5 days less for patients treated with rasburicase than for patients treated with allopurinol (P < .0001), and total LOS was 5 days less for patients treated with rasburicase than for patients treated with allopurinol (P = .02). Total costs per patient were $20,038 lower for patients treated with rasburicase than for patients treated with allopurinol (P < .02). Cost per percentage UA reduction was also lower for patients treated with rasburicase versus patients treated with allopurinol ($3899 vs. $16,894; P < .001).\nCONCLUSION: In this analysis of TLS patients who received care in real-world settings, rasburicase versus allopurinol was significantly more effective in treating hyperuricemia and was associated with significantly shorter ICU and overall hospital stays and lower total inpatient costs.",

An illustrative example is urate metabolism. Before the publication of the complete human genome, in 2003 it was believed that a single enzyme (urate oxidase) was responsible for uricolysis that is the conversion of urate into the more soluble allantoin. Now we know with great detail that this process requires the consecutive action of three enzymes that have been lost by gene inactivation in our hominoid ancestor. Similarly, a single urate transporter (URAT1) was known at that time. Now we have evidence that urate homeostasis depends on a complex set of transporters located on the epithelial cells of the kidney and the intestine. In this review article, we give an account of the recent discoveries on urate metabolism and how these discoveries can be applied to the development of novel drugs to treat hyperuricemia, tumor lysis syndrome and the Lesch-Nyhan disease.",

        "Abstract":"50\nHyperuricemia is a kind of metabolic disease resulted from imbalance between urate production and excretion. Xanthine oxidase (XOD) or renal urate transporter 1 (URAT1) inhibitors have been applied for hyperuricemia treatment in clinic, but available drugs could not simultaneously target XOD and URAT1 and had various adverse effects. (E)-2-(4-bromophenyl)-1-(2, 4-dihydroxyphenyl)ethanone oxime (BDEO), as a deoxybenzoins oxime analog, was obtained from a cluster of deoxybenzoins derivatives synthesized by our research group with potent anti-hyperuricemic activity, which was expected to be dual inhibitor of XOD and URAT1. This study aimed to investigate effects of BDEO on XOD and URAT1 in vitro, as well as the possible mechanism by which BDEO attenuated hyperuricemia in vivo. In vitro, BDEO obviously inhibited XOD activity with an IC value of 3.33μM, moreover, in Human embryonic kidney (HEK)293 cells expressing URAT1, BDEO and benzbromarone blocked uptake of uric acid with a Ki value of 0.145μM. On the other hand, mice were orally administrated by oxonate for seven consecutive days to induce hyperuricemia, BDEO at various doses were administered intragastrically to hyperuricemic and normal mice daily. BDEO dose-dependently decreased serum urate level and uric acid excretion in 24h in hyperuricemic mice. More importantly, BDEO significantly suppressed hepatic XOD activity and down-regulated renal URAT1 protein level in hyperuricemic mice. Notably, BDEO exhibited no effects on all these detected biochemical indicators in normal mice, predicting its safety. Taken together, the data suggested that BDEO may serve as a dual XOD and URAT1 inhibitor for treatment of hyperuricemia.",

        "Abstract":"OBJECTIVE: To evaluate and compare the safety and efficacy of three urate lowering agents: febuxostat, allopurinol, and benzbromarone, when used to treat Chinese gout patients.\nMETHODS: A total of 120 patients treated in our department from November 2011 to December 2014 were randomly selected and divided into four groups: febuxostat (40 mg per day), febuxostat (80 mg per day), allopurinol (100 mg, 3 × per day) or benzbromarone (50 mg per day), (n = 30 patients\/group). The serum uric acid (UA) concentrations of the patients in each group were recorded and compared from week 2 through week 24 after the treatments, and all adverse events were evaluated to determine the safety of the various treatment regimens.\nRESULTS: Treatment with febuxostat (40 mg) significantly reduced serum UA levels to those achieved with allopurinol or benzbromarone treatment. The treatment with febuxostat (80 mg) produced the best therapeutic effect and achieved the targeted UA level as early as week 2. However, the total number of patients experiencing adverse events was significantly higher in the febuxostat 80-mg group. The incidences of abnormal liver function, hyperlipidemia, and gout flare were higher in both febuxostat treatment groups. The allopurinol group had a higher incidence of hypersensitivity, and the benzbromarone group had a higher incidence of renal dysfunction.\nCONCLUSION: Chinese patients treated with the 40-mg dose of febuxostat experienced a treatment effect and total rate of adverse events similar to those produced by allopurinol or benzbromarone. To achieve a better therapeutic effect, the dose of febuxostat can be elevated to 80 mg per day; however, patients receiving the higher dose must be closely monitored for signs of liver dysfunction. Febuxostat is an alternative treatment for Chinese gout patients who are at a much higher risk for severe cutaneous adverse reactions as well as for patients with a history of kidney stones..",

Allopurinol is very effective at reducing plasma urate concentrations to a level sufficient to dissolve monosodium urate crystals. However, many patients fail to achieve a sufficient therapeutic response to allopurinol. Areas covered: This review covers the metabolism and pharmacokinetics of allopurinol and its active metabolite, oxypurinol and how these factors affect the plasma concentrations of urate at initiation and during long-term therapy with allopurinol. Significant aspects discussed are the importance of adherence to allopurinol therapy, allopurinol hypersensitivity reactions and insights into hyperuricemia. Expert opinion: The initial dosage of allopurinol should be low, particularly in patients with renal impairment. The dose should then be increased slowly until plasma concentrations of urate are sufficient to dissolve monosodium urate crystals (≤ 0.36 mmol\/L). For this target, the maintenance dose of allopurinol can be estimated from the equation: Dose = 1413*(U-0.36) where U is the pre-treatment concentration of urate. Poor adherence is a major factor limiting successful therapy with allopurinol; however, its use can be improved considerably by education of patients and clinicians. Allopurinol is generally well tolerated and screening for genetic factors predictive of allopurinol hypersensitivity reactions can now be undertaken.",

Despite progress in many areas of pathophysiology and genetics of gout and the development of new urate lowering therapies, there remain a number of unanswered clinical questions. With the resurgence of interest in gout it is important to recognize key aspects of gout management that remain challenging and require further research.\nRECENT FINDINGS: The unanswered clinical issues outlined in this review are basic aspects of gout management that clinicians treating people with gout face on a daily basis and include when urate lowering therapy should be commenced, the most appropriate target serum urate, use of prophylaxis when starting urate lowering therapy and the most appropriate urate lowering therapy, particularly for those with chronic kidney disease.\nSUMMARY: Some of the issues outlined in this article are the subject of ongoing clinical research and some, such as use of allopurinol in people with chronic kidney impairment, may be less relevant with the advent of potentially safer urate lowering therapies but until that time further understanding to aid clinical decision-making is required.",

        "Abstract":"Epidemiological studies indicate that hyperuricaemia is an independent risk factor for cardiovascular disease. Alongside uric acid formation, increased xanthine oxidase activity also results in the formation of oxidative free radicals and superoxide particles. Oxidative stress significantly contributes to the development of cardiovascular disease, including endothelial cell dysfunction, atherosclerosis, vascular calcification and impaired myocardial energetics. Allopurinol, a competitive xanthine oxidase inhibitor, in addition to reducing serum uric acid levels, can act as a free radical scavenger. Although traditionally used for the management of gout, there has been renewed interest in the role of allopurinol in the management of cardiovascular disease. In this review, we summarise the role of the xanthine oxidase pathway in the generation of oxidative stress and evaluate the current body of evidence assessing the clinical effects of allopurinol in patients with cardiovascular disease. A number of small clinical studies have shown a beneficial effect of allopurinol in reducing ischemia-reperfusion injury in the setting of bypass surgery and coronary angioplasty. Additionally, studies in heart failure indicate a potential favourable effect of allopurinol on endothelial dysfunction, LV function and haemodynamic indices, particularly in those with raised serum uric acid levels. Whilst this cheap and readily available pharmacological option may offer a very cost effective therapeutic option, large-scale prospective studies are required to better delineate its role in reducing hard clinical end-points.",

        "Abstract":"OBJECTIVE: Positive HLA-B*5801 carriers are at greater risk of experiencing rare but severe allopurinol hypersensitivity syndrome (AHS) [i.e., Stevens-Johnson syndrome (SJS) and toxic epidermal necrolysis (TEN)]; however, HLA-B*5801 prevalence and AHS risk vary by race\/ethnicity. We evaluated the cost-effectiveness of HLA-B*5801 testing according to race\/ethnicity in the United States.\nMETHODS: We determined the cost-effectiveness of universal testing for HLA-B*5801 compared to no testing prior to the initiation of allopurinol per US major race\/ethnicity groups. Using US-specific data, SJS\/TEN risks and HLA-B*5801 prevalences were modeled per race\/ethnicity (i.e., 1\/3846 and 0.7% among Caucasians and Hispanics, 1\/735 and 3.8% among African Americans, and 1\/336 and 7.4% among Asians, respectively). Those who tested positive for HLA-B*5801 received febuxostat. Costs, quality-adjusted life-years (QALYs), and incremental cost-effectiveness ratios (ICERs) were estimated over a lifetime.\nRESULTS: Compared to no testing, universal testing for HLA-B*5801 costs more and was more effective for all races\/ethnicities. The ICERs varied substantially across racial\/ethnic groups, following their HLA-B*5801 prevalences. HLA-B*5801 testing was cost-effective for African Americans (ICER $83,450) and Asians (ICER $64,190), but not for Caucasians or Hispanics (ICER $183,720), using accepted US willingness-to-pay threshold ($109,000\/QALY). Results were robust in sensitivity analyses, except that reducing the risk of SJS\/TEN by a half made testing not cost-effective for all races\/ethnicities.\nCONCLUSION: Testing for HLA-B*5801 prior to allopurinol initiation is cost-effective for Asians and African Americans, but not for Caucasians or Hispanics in the United States. Reducing AHS risk by other predictive measures could make HLA-B*5801 testing not cost-effective even among Asians and Blacks.",

Animal models of MS show a significant improvement when the process of angiogenesis is halted. In this study, we measured the serum levels of vascular-endothelial growth factor (VEGF), soluble Endoglin (sEng), angiopoietin 1(Ang-1), angiopoietin 2 (Ang-2), and uric acid (UA) as well as serum anti-Epstein-Barr virus (EBV) EBNA-1 IgG in 50 MS patients (including 20 newly diagnosed and 30 patients taking IFN-beta for >6months) and 40 healthy individuals. Enzyme-linked immunosorbent assays (ELISA) were used apart from UA where the uricase quantitative enzymatic assay was used. A significant increase of VEGF, Ang-1, Ang-2, and sEng in serum samples of MS patients with respect to healthy subjects was observed. VEGF was higher in newly diagnosed MS patients in comparison to patients taking interferon-beta and was associated with EDSS. The serum levels of UA were statistically lower in MS patients as compared to the healthy group. Higher levels of anti-EBV antibody titers were seen in MS patients than controls and anti-EBV titers correlated with angiogenic factors. It seems that in summary, angiogenesis may play an important role in MS and infection with EBV might be correlated with this phenomenon.",

        "Abstract":"BACKGROUND: With the prevalence of and hospitalizations for gout increasing, optimizing care for patients with gout is imperative. The 2012 American College of Rheumatology gout guidelines emphasize that timely monitoring is key to achieving serum urate (SUA) goals. Few studies have examined this metric following the 2012 update, and to our knowledge, none have examined a veteran population.\nOBJECTIVE: To evaluate adherence to urate-lowering therapy (ULT) monitoring guidelines in a veteran population.\nMETHODS: This is a single-center, multisite, retrospective chart review of US veterans receiving ULT for gout within the VA (Veterans Affairs) Tennessee Valley Healthcare System from January 1, 2013, to June 30, 2015. The primary end point was percentage of patients with a SUA within 6 months of initial xanthine oxidase inhibitor prescription. Secondary end points included percentage of patients with SUA <6 mg\/dL and percentage of patients with uptitration following SUA above goal.\nRESULTS: A total of 601 patients met inclusion criteria for the study; after application of exclusion criteria, 505 were analyzed. Of these, 295 patients (58%) did not have a SUA drawn within 6 months, and 162 patients (32%) reached the end of the study period without SUA measured. Of 226 patients with SUA above goal on initial check, 64 (28%) had timely dose adjustment, whereas 143 patients (63%) had no adjustment. A total of 161 patients (32%) had a SUA at goal within the study period.\nCONCLUSIONS: Rates of ULT monitoring at a major VA medical center were suboptimal, and improved adherence to guideline recommendations is needed.",

        "Abstract":"We aimed to investigate the effects of febuxostat on IR and the expression of high-sensitivity C-reactive protein (hs-CRP) in patients with primary gout. Forty-two cases of primary gout patients without uric acid-lowering therapy were included in this study. After a physical examination, 20 age- and sex-matched patients were included as normal controls. The levels of fasting insulin (INS), fasting blood glucose (FBG), and hs-CRP were determined. IR was assessed using the Homeostasis Model Assessment of Insulin Resistance (HOMA-IR). Gout patients had higher levels of UA, INS, HOMA-IR, and hs-CRP than normal controls (P < 0.05). After 4-, 12-, and 24-week febuxostat treatments, UA and hs-CRP concentrations were significantly lower than baseline (P < 0.05). INS and HOM-IR decreased slightly after a 4-week treatment with febuxostat but declined significantly after 12 and 24 weeks of treatment. Importantly, hs-CRP values positively correlated with those of HOMA-IR (r = 0.353, P = 0.018) and INS (r = 0.426, P = 0.034). Our findings confirm that IR exists in gout patients and implicate that febuxostat can effectively control the level of serum UA and increase insulin sensitivity in primary gout patients.",

        "Abstract":"Objective The effects of febuxostat therapy on hyperuricemia in patients with and without type 2 diabetes were compared in this retrospective observational study after pair-matching using the propensity scores. Methods In total, 160 patients with hyperuricemia were studied as the treated set, and the 155 subjects in whom the administration of febuxostat was not discontinued during the observation period were investigated in the full analysis. The study subjects were divided into two groups based on the style of initiation of febuxostat: initial and switching therapy from allopurinol administration. Results The reduction in the serum uric acid (sUA) levels at six months after the initiation of febuxostat administration did not significantly differ between the patients with and without diabetes in both the initial (206±114 and 226±113 μmol\/L in patients with and without diabetes, respectively) and switching (154±91 and 129±90 μmol\/L in patients with and without diabetes, respectively) therapy groups. The eGFR values were significantly increased compared to the baseline levels only in the patients without diabetes. The changes in the eGFR values were significantly associated with the presence of diabetes and sUA at baseline in a multivariate analysis. The frequency of adverse events was not significantly different between the patients with and without diabetes. Conclusion Although febuxostat exerted a similar sUA-lowering effect against hyperuricemia in patients with type 2 diabetes compared to those without, the renoprotective effect was attenuated in those with diabetes compared to nondiabetic subjects.",

Several adverse events have been observed during therapy with febuxostat. DRESS (Drug Reaction with Eosinophilia and Systemic Symptoms) syndrome induced by febuxostat has been poorly described, mainly in patient with CKD who previously developed allopurinol hypersensitivity syndrome. DRESS syndrome is characterized by manifold cutaneous reactions and systemic disorders with potential devastating consequences. The underlying pathogenetic mechanisms remain unidentified, though immune responses are often complicated. P-i concept can partially explain the phenomenon.

Catalysis by XO to produce uric acid and reactive oxygen species leads to many diseases. Anti hyperuricemic therapy by xanthine oxidase inhibitors has been mainly employed for the treatment of gout. Area covered: This review covers the patent literature (2011-2015) and also presents the interesting strategies\/rational approaches employed for the design of xanthine oxidase inhibitors reported recently. Expert opinion: Recent literature indicates that various non purine scaffolds have been extensively investigated for xanthine oxidase inhibition. The significant potential endowed by heteroaryl based compounds, in particularly fused heterocycles clearly highlights their clinical promise and the need for detailed investigation. Studies by various research groups have also revealed that the flavone framework is open for isosteric replacements and structural modifications for yielding potent non purine xanthine oxidase inhibitors. In addition, various plant extracts recently reported to possess significant xanthine oxidase inhibitory potential presents enough promise to initiate a screening program for the identification of other plant extracts and phytoconstituents possessing inhibitory potential towards the enzyme.",

Characterized by hyperuricemia and the effects of acute and chronic inflammation in joints and bursa, gout leads to an agonizing, chronically painful arthritis. Arthritis can also be accompanied by urate nephropathy and subcutaneous urate deposits (tophi). Exciting new developments in the last decade have brought back the focus on this interesting, crystal-induced chronic inflammatory condition. New insights include the role of NALP3 inflammasome-induced inflammation in acute gout, the characterization of diagnostic signs on ultrasound and dual-energy computed tomography imaging modalities, the recognition of target serum urate less than 6 mg\/day as the goal for urate-lowering therapies, and evidence-based treatment guidelines. A better understanding of disease mechanisms has enabled drug discovery - three new urate-lowering drugs have been approved in the last decade, with several more in the pipeline. We now recognize the important role that environment and genetics play in the causation of gout. A focus on the cardiac, renal, and metabolic comorbidities of gout will help translational research and discovery over the next decade.",

In terms of the effectiveness of topiroxostat in lowering serum urate levels, the dose-response relationship has been evaluated; however, it remains to be verified. A randomized, multi-center, double-blinded study of topiroxostat was performed for Japanese hyperuricemic patients with or without gout. During the 16-week study, 157 Japanese hyperuricemic patients with or without gout were randomly assigned to receive a placebo, topiroxostat at 120 or 160 mg\/day, or allopurinol at 200 mg\/day. The primary endpoint of this study was to determine the lowering rate of serum uric acid levels compared to those of baseline at the end of administration. A dose-response relationship (regarding decreases in the serum urate levels) was confirmed for the placebo and topiroxostat at 120 and at 160 mg\/day. Moreover, at the end of administration, the lowering rate of serum urate levels was determined to be -44.8% in the topiroxostat 160-mg\/day group.

A maximum tolerated dose study was conducted to determine the lesinurad supratherapeutic dose, followed by a thorough QTc study to characterize the effect of lesinurad on cardiac repolarization.\nMETHODS: The maximum tolerated dose study was a randomized, double-blind, placebo-controlled, single-ascending dose study that enrolled 35 healthy men and women. Lesinurad plasma exposure (maximum observed plasma concentration and area under the plasma concentration versus time curve) was determined at doses of 800 mg, 1,200 mg, and 1,600 mg. The thorough QTc study was a double-blind, four-period, placebo-controlled crossover study with 54 healthy men and women who received single doses of lesinurad 1,600 mg (supratherapeutic dose), lesinurad 400 mg, moxifloxacin 400 mg, and placebo in randomized sequence. Digital 12-lead electrocardiograms were recorded at eleven time points over 24 hours in each treatment period. QT intervals were corrected for heart rate using an individual-specific correction factor (QTcI).\nRESULTS: The upper bound of the one-sided 95% confidence interval for time-matched, placebo-subtracted, baseline-adjusted QTcI intervals (ΔΔQTcI) was <10 ms for both the lesinurad 400 mg and 1,600 mg doses. ΔΔQTcI was independent of lesinurad concentrations. No QTcI thresholds >480 ms or QTcI increases >30 ms were observed. Moxifloxacin mean QTcI intervals were >5 ms, and the lower bounds of the 90% confidence interval were >5 ms at 2 hours, 3 hours, and 4 hours, confirming assay sensitivity.\nCONCLUSION: Lesinurad, at supratherapeutic doses, does not have a significant effect on the QT interval in healthy male or female subjects.",

Study quality was assessed by 2 independent reviewers. Strength-of-evidence assessment was done by group discussion.\nDATA SYNTHESIS: High-strength evidence from 28 trials (only 3 of which were placebo-controlled) shows that colchicine, nonsteroidal anti-inflammatory drugs (NSAIDs), and corticosteroids reduce pain in patients with acute gout. Moderate-strength evidence suggests that low-dose colchicine is as effective as high-dose colchicine and causes fewer gastrointestinal adverse events. Moderate-strength evidence suggests that urate-lowering therapy (allopurinol or febuxostat) reduces long-term risk for acute gout attacks after 1 year or more. High-strength evidence shows that prophylaxis with daily colchicine or NSAIDs reduces the risk for acute gout attacks by at least half in patients starting urate-lowering therapy, and moderate-strength evidence indicates that duration of prophylaxis should be longer than 8 weeks. Although lower urate levels reduce risk for recurrent acute attacks, treatment to a specific target level has not been tested.\nLIMITATION: Few studies of acute gout treatments, no placebo-controlled trials of management of hyperuricemia lasting longer than 6 months, and few studies in primary care populations.\nCONCLUSION: Colchicine, NSAIDs, and corticosteroids relieve pain in adults with acute gout. Urate-lowering therapy decreases serum urate levels and reduces risk for acute gout attacks.\nPRIMARY FUNDING SOURCE: Agency for Healthcare Research and Quality.

We pursued genomic sequencing of XOI metabolism and clearance genes to identify single-nucleotide polymorphisms (SNPs) relate to differences in XOI dose. Subjects with a diagnosis of Gout based on the 1977 American College of Rheumatology Classification Criteria for the disorder, who were on stable doses of a XOI, and who were at their goal SUA level, were enrolled. The primary outcome was relationship between SNPs in any of these genes to XOI dose. The secondary outcome was relationship between SNPs and change in pre- and post-treatment SUA. We enrolled 100 subjects. The average patient age was 68.6 ± 10.6 years old. Over 80% were men and 77% were Caucasian. One SNP was associated with a higher XOI dose: rs75995567 (p = 0.031). Two SNPs were associated with 300 mg daily of allopurinol: rs11678615 (p = 0.022) and rs3731722 on Aldehyde Oxidase (AO) (His1297Arg) (p = 0.001). Two SNPs were associated with a lower dose of allopurinol: rs1884725 (p = 0.033) and rs34650714 (p = 0.006). For the secondary outcome, rs13415401 was the only SNP related to a smaller mean SUA change. Ten SNPs were identified with a larger change in SUA.

        "Abstract":"Xanthine oxidoreductase (XOR) is the rate-limiting enzyme in purine catabolism and converts hypoxanthine to xanthine, and xanthine into uric acid. When concentrations of uric acid exceed its biochemical saturation point, crystals of uric acid, in the form of monosodium urate, emerge and can predispose an individual to gout, the commonest form of inflammatory arthritis in men aged over 40 years. XOR inhibitors are primarily used in the treatment of gout, reducing the formation of uric acid and thereby, preventing the formation of monosodium urate crystals. Allopurinol is established as first-line therapy for gout; a newer alternative, febuxostat, is used in patients unable to tolerate allopurinol. This review provides an overview of gout, a detailed analysis of the structure and function of XOR, discussion on the pharmacokinetics and pharmacodynamics of XOR inhibitors-allopurinol and febuxostat, and the relevance of XOR in common comorbidities of gout.",

        "Abstract":"Gout is a chronic disease of deposition of monosodium urate crystals, which form in the presence of increased urate concentrations. Although environmental factors contribute to hyperuricaemia, renal and gut excretion of urate is central to regulation of serum urate, and genetic factors are important. Activation of the NLRP3 inflammasome and release of interleukin 1β have key roles in initiation of acute gout flares. A \"treat to target serum urate\" approach is essential for effective gout management; long-term lowering of serum urate to less than 360 μmol\/L leads to crystal dissolution and ultimately to suppression of flares. An allopurinol dose-escalation strategy is frequently effective for achieving treatment targets, and several new urate-lowering drugs are also available. Worldwide, rates of initiation and continuation of urate-lowering therapy are very low, and, consequently, achievement of serum urate targets is infrequent. Strategies to improve quality of gout care are needed.",

        "Published":"2016-10-28",
        "Abstract":"OBJECTIVE: To identify the best-performing survey definition of gout from items commonly available in epidemiologic studies.\nMETHODS: Survey definitions of gout were identified from 34 epidemiologic studies contributing to the Global Urate Genetics Consortium (GUGC) genome-wide association study. Data from the Study for Updated Gout Classification Criteria (SUGAR) were randomly divided into development and test data sets. A data-driven case definition was formed using logistic regression in the development data set. This definition, along with definitions used in GUGC studies and the 2015 American College of Rheumatology (ACR)\/European League Against Rheumatism (EULAR) gout classification criteria were applied to the test data set, using monosodium urate crystal identification as the gold standard.\nRESULTS: For all tested GUGC definitions, the simple definition of \"self-report of gout or urate-lowering therapy use\" had the best test performance characteristics (sensitivity 82%, specificity 72%). The simple definition had similar performance to a SUGAR data-driven case definition with 5 weighted items: self-report, self-report of doctor diagnosis, colchicine use, urate-lowering therapy use, and hyperuricemia (sensitivity 87%, specificity 70%). Both of these definitions performed better than the 1977 American Rheumatism Association survey criteria (sensitivity 82%, specificity 67%). Of all tested definitions, the 2015 ACR\/EULAR criteria had the best performance (sensitivity 92%, specificity 89%).\nCONCLUSION: A simple definition of \"self-report of gout or urate-lowering therapy use\" has the best test performance characteristics of existing definitions that use routinely available data. A more complex combination of features is more sensitive, but still lacks good specificity. If a more accurate case definition is required for a particular study, the 2015 ACR\/EULAR gout classification criteria should be considered.",

Two transient increases in sUA (maximal sUA 1.0 and 6.2mg\/dL, respectively), were associated with azathioprine non-compliance and resolved with azathioprine reinstitution. Literature review confirmed successful use of DMARDs for prevention of anti-drug antibodies to anti-TNF-α therapies in RA, spondyloarthropathies, and inflammatory bowel disease. Additionally, one open-label trial of pegloticase for refractory tophaceous gout included 7 organ transplant recipients on immunosuppressive medications (mycophenolate mofetil, cyclosporine, azathioprine, and\/or tacrolimus), only one of whom (14%) was noted to experience treatment failure (anti-pegloticase antibodies and loss of urate-lowering efficacy without infusion reaction), versus 52% (n =12) of non-immunosuppressed subjects (n = 23).\nCONCLUSIONS: Low doses of oral immunosuppressive therapy may provide a safe, cost-effective adjunct to prevent the development of anti-drug antibodies associated with infusion reactions and high rate of pegloticase failure in patients with refractory gout. Controlled studies to assess an immunosuppressive strategy when using pegloticase are warranted.",

The aim of the present study was to compare the UA-lowering effects of a standard dose of the UA synthesis inhibitor febuxostat to a standard dose of the uricosuric agent benzbromarone, and to investigate the effects of a low-dose combination of both agents in hypertensive patients with hyperuricemia. Twenty hypertensive patients with inadequate UA control were administered febuxostat 40 mg (Feb), benzbromarone 50 mg (Ben) and febuxostat 20 mg and benzbromarone 25 mg (feb\/ben) for 3 months each in a randomized modified crossover manner. UA metabolism, blood pressure (BP) and the indices of organ damage were assessed at baseline and the end of each treatment period. No significant changes were observed in BP or estimated glomerular filtration rate (eGFR) after the treatment with each UA-lowering regimen. The change in UA was significantly greater with feb\/ben than with Feb. The excretion of UA and clearance of UA were higher with Ben than with Feb and feb\/ben. Urinary 8-hydroxydeoxyguanosine and liver-type fatty-acid-binding protein levels were slightly lower with Ben, whereas flow-mediated dilation was slightly higher with feb\/ben and Ben. The UA-lowering effects of the low-dose combination of the UA synthesis inhibitor and uricosuric agent were greater than those of the standard dose of each agent alone. The uricosuric agent may be more effective at improving vascular function than the UA synthesis inhibitor. Thus, the appropriate management of hyperuricemia with uricosuric drugs appears to be useful for hypertensive patients with hyperuricemia.",

In healthy subjects, the pharmacokinetic parameters of febuxostat after multiple oral dose administration include an oral availability of about 85 %, an apparent oral clearance (CL\/F) of 10.5 ± 3.4 L\/h and an apparent volume of distribution at steady state (V \/F) of 48 ± 23 L. The time course of plasma concentrations follows a two-compartment model. The initial half-life (t ) is approximately 2 h and the terminal t  determined at daily doses of 40 mg or more is 9.4 ± 4.9 h. Febuxostat is administered once daily. The maximum (peak) plasma concentrations are approximately 100-fold greater than the trough concentrations. Consequently, there is no significant accumulation of the drug during multiple dose administration. There are few data on the pharmacokinetics of febuxostat in patients with gout. While the pharmacokinetic parameters are not affected by mild to moderate hepatic impairment, there is no consensus on whether renal impairment has any effect on the pharmacokinetics of febuxostat. Febuxostat is extensively metabolised by oxidation (approximately 35 %) and acyl glucuronidation (up to 40 %); febuxostat acyl glucuronides are cleared by the kidney. In healthy subjects treated with multiple doses of febuxostat 10-240 mg, the concentrations of serum urate are reduced by a maximum of about 80 %. The percentage reduction in the concentrations of serum urate is slightly less in gouty patients than in healthy subjects.",

As a consequence of persisting hyperuricemia, uric acid crystals are deposited in the intra-articular and periarticular spaces and activate the innate immune system. The clinically impressive abrupt onset monoarticular arthritis in the lower extremities is highly suggestive of a gout attack. Arthrosonography can be used for early detection of crystal deposition on joint cartilage. In synovial fluid the detection of uric acid crystals in polarization microscopy is proof of gout even without the detection of intracellular uric acid crystals. Rapidly acting anti-inflammatory drugs are available for acute treatment of attacks; however, the essential therapy is the effective and life-long drug treatment of hyperuricemia from the first attack onwards, typically with allopurinol or febuxostat.

        "Abstract":"BACKGROUND: The use of calcineurin inhibitors is a well-known risk factor for hyperuricemia in kidney transplant recipients. We evaluated the effect of febuxostat (Fx), a new uric acid-lowering drug, on hyperuricemia and renal injury in an experimental model of chronic tacrolimus (Tac)-induced nephropathy.\nMETHODS: Chronic Tac nephropathy was induced by administering Tac (1.5 mg\/kg\/day) to rats on a low-salt diet (0.05%) with oxonic acid (OA, 2%, 0.2 g\/kg\/day) for 28 days. Two doses of Fx (5 and 10 mg\/kg) were concomitantly administered with Tac or vehicle (Vh). We evaluated the effect of Fx on hyperuricemia by measuring serum uric acid (SUA) levels, fractional excretion of uric acid (FEUA), and urate transporters in Tac-induced nephropathy. The effects of Fx on Tac-induced renal injury were evaluated in terms of renal function and arteriolopathy, tubulointerstitial fibrosis, inflammation, and apoptosis. We evaluated oxidative stress as a protective mechanism via xanthine oxidase (XO) activity, and as a marker of oxidative stress (via evaluation of levels of 8-hydroxy-2'-deoxyguanosine (8-OHdG) and 4-hydroxy-2-hexenal (4-HHE)).\nRESULTS: The Tac group showed higher SUA levels and lower FEUA than did the Vh group, but Fx treatment significantly decreased SUA levels in a dose-dependent manner, with an increase of FEUA at a high dose (10 mg\/kg). Tac treatment increased urate-anion exchanger 1 and decreased organic anion transporter type 1 expression in renal tubular cells, but Fx treatment reversed the effects on those transporters. Impaired renal function and histological injury (interstitial fibrosis, inflammation, and arteriolopathy) in the Tac group were markedly improved by Fx administration. Increases in apoptotic cell death and activation of proapoptotic caspase-3 by Tac were remarkably decreased by Fx treatment. Tac administration increased the activity of XO in kidney tissue and serum, and the levels of 8-OHdG in urine and 8-OHdG and 4-HHE of kidney tissue, but combined treatment with Fx decreased the levels of these parameters.\nCONCLUSIONS: Fx is effective in controlling hyperuricemia and in preventing Tac-induced renal injury, via a reduction of oxidative stress. Therefore, a targeted therapy aimed at inhibiting uric acid by Fx may be a useful approach in the management of the progression of nephropathy in renal transplant patients treated with Tac.",

Chronic kidney disease (CKD) and hypertension (HTN) are two major public health problems, and both are associated with increased risk of cardiovascular events. Emerging evidence suggests a pathogenic role of hyperuricemia in the development of HTN and CKD, in addition to progression of CKD, by inducing renal inflammation, endothelial dysfunction, and activation of the renin-angiotensin system. In addition, several epidemiological studies have linked hyperuricemia with an increased risk of HTN and CKD. A few clinical trials have assessed the use of uric acid-lowering therapies such as allopurinol and febuxostat in the management of HTN and delaying progression of CKD. To date, most of these trials are short-term with a small sample size; however, their results are encouraging and provide a rationale for larger randomized controlled trials to establish the role of uric acid-lowering therapies in the management of HTN, in addition to prevention of CKD progression and cardiovascular events.",

Only randomized controlled trials were included. The primary outcomes were reduction in systolic BP (SBP) and diastolic BP (DBP), and secondary was reduction in serum creatinine level.\nRESULTS: Patients treated with allopurinol had greater reduction in SBP (standardized difference in means [SDM] = 0.321, 95% confidence interval [CI]: 0.145-0.497, p < 0.001), DBP (SDM = 0.260, 95% CI: 0.102 to 0.417, p = 0.001), and creatinine level (SDM = 0.312, 95% CI: 0.008 to 0.615, p = 0.044) than control patients. Subgroup analysis showed that allopurinol significantly decreased SBP whether or not antihypertensive drugs were being administered; a decrease in DBP was only seen in patients receiving antihypertensive drugs.

        "Abstract":"BACKGROUND: Gout is the most common inflammatory arthritis, which, if left untreated or inadequately treated, will lead to joint destruction, bone erosion and disability due to the crystal deposition. Uric acid transporter 1 (URAT1) was the promising therapeutic target for urate-lowering therapy.\nOBJECTIVE: The goal of this work is to understand the structure-activity relationship (SAR) of a potent lesinurad-based hit, sodium 2-((5-bromo-4-((4-cyclopropyl-naphth-1-yl)methyl)-4H-1,2,4-triazol-3- yl)thio)acetate (1c), and based on that discover a more potent URAT1 inhibitor.\nMETHODS: The SAR of 1c was systematically explored and the in vitro URAT1 inhibitory activity of synthesized compounds 1a-1t was determined by the inhibition of URAT1-mediated [8-14C]uric acid uptake by human embryonic kidney 293 (HEK293) cells stably expressing human URAT1.\nRESULTS: Twenty compounds 1a-1t were synthesized. SAR analysis was performed. Two highly active URAT1 inhibitors, sodium 2-((5-bromo-4-((4-n-propylnaphth-1-yl)methyl)-4H-1,2,4-triazol-3- yl)thio)acetate (1j) and sodium 2-((5-bromo-4-((4-bromonaphth-1-yl)methyl)-4H-1,2,4-triazol-3- yl)thio)acetate (1m), were identified, which were 78- and 76-fold more active than parent lesinurad in in vitro URAT1 inhibitory assay, respectively (IC50 values for 1j and 1m were 0.092 μM and 0.094 μM, respectively, against human URAT1 vs 7.18 μM for lesinurad).\nCONCLUSION: Two highly active URAT1 inhibitors were discovered. The SAR exploration also identified more flexible naphthyltriazolylmethane as a novel molecular skeleton that will be valuable for the design of URAT1 inhibitors, as indicated by the observation that many of the synthesized naphthyltriazolylmethane- bearing derivatives (1b-1d, 1g, 1j and 1m) showed significantly improved UART1 inhibitory activity (sub-micromolar IC50 values) as compared with lesinurad which has the rigid naphthyltriazole skeleton.",

We evaluated whether lowering serum uric acid levels with allopurinol improves endothelial dysfunction in 80 participants ≥18 years of age with stage 3 CKD and asymptomatic hyperuricemia (≥7 mg\/dl in men and ≥6 mg\/dl in women) randomized in a double-blinded manner to receive placebo or allopurinol for 12 weeks. Randomization was stratified according to presence or absence of diabetes mellitus. We measured vascular endothelial function by brachial artery flow-mediated dilation. No significant differences existed between groups at baseline; 61% of the participants had diabetes mellitus in both groups. The placebo and the allopurinol groups had baseline serum uric acid levels (SDs) of 8.7 (1.6) mg\/dl and 8.3 (1.4) mg\/dl, respectively, and baseline flow-mediated dilation values (SDs) of 6.0% (5.0%) and 4.8% (5.0%), respectively. Compared with placebo, allopurinol lowered serum uric acid significantly but did not improve endothelial function. In participants without diabetes mellitus, allopurinol associated with a trend toward improved flow-mediated dilation (+1.4% [3.9%] versus -0.7% [4.1%] with placebo), but this was not statistically significant (=0.26). Furthermore, we did not detect significant differences between groups in BP or serum levels of markers of inflammation and oxidative stress.

In this work, a series of 2-arylbenzo[b]furan derivatives were synthesized based on salvianolic acid C, and they were evaluated for xanthine oxidase inhibitory and antioxidant activities. Compounds 5b, 6a, 6e and 6f showed potent xanthine oxidase inhibitory activities with IC values ranging from 3.99 to 6.36 μM, which were comparable with that of allopurinol. Lineweaver-Burk plots analysis revealed that the representative derivative 6e could bind to either xanthine oxidase or the xanthine oxidase-xanthine complex, which exhibited a mixed-type competitive mechanism. A DPPH radical scavenging assay showed most of the hydroxyl-functionalized 2-arylbenzo[b]furan derivatives possessed the potent antioxidant activity, which was further validated on LPS-stimulated RAW 264.7 macrophages model. The structure-activity relationships were preliminary analyzed and indicated that the structural skeleton of 2-arylbenzo[b]furan and phenolic hydroxyl groups played an important role in maintaining xanthine oxidase inhibitory effect and antioxidant property for the series of derivatives.

We hypothesized that uric acid production, as assessed indirectly from XOR variants, is associated with hypertension.\nMETHODS: Among 2769 participants (48.3% men; mean age 40.7 years) randomly recruited from European populations, we genotyped 25 tagging XOR SNPs and measured blood pressure (BP) at baseline and follow-up (median 8.8 years). The relation between variants of the XOR gene with changes in pulse pressure and mean arterial pressure over time; and incidence of hypertension, were analyzed.\nRESULTS: Compared with nonminor allele carriers, pulse pressure increased approximately 2 mmHg more in minor allele carriers of rs11904439 (P = 0.01), whereas mean arterial pressure and DBP increased approximately 1 mmHg less in minor allele carriers of rs2043013 (P = 0.01). In 2050, participants normotensive at baseline, hazard ratios contrasting risk of hypertension in minor allele carriers vs. nonminor allele carriers were 1.31 (95% confidence interval 1.03-1.68; P = 0.02) and 1.69 (95% confidence interval 1.11-2.57; P = 0.01) for rs11904439 and rs148756340, respectively. With the false discovery rate set at 0.25, the aforementioned associations retained significance. The changes in SBP from baseline to follow-up and the serum levels of uric acid at baseline (n = 1949) were not associated with XOR.\nCONCLUSION: Pending confirmation, our findings suggest that variation in uric acid production, as captured by genetic variation in XOR, might be a predictor of changes in BP and in the risk of hypertension.",

The primary end point was the proportion of patients achieving a serum UA level of <6.0 mg\/dl at month 6. Key secondary end points were the mean gout flare rate requiring treatment (months 7-12) and the proportions of patients with complete resolution of ≥1 target tophus (month 12). Safety assessments included adverse events and laboratory data.\nRESULTS: The study patients (n = 603) were predominantly male and had a mean ± SD age of 51.9 ± 11.3 years, a gout duration of 11.8 ± 9.4 years, a baseline serum UA level of 6.94 ± 1.27 mg\/dl, and were receiving an allopurinol dosage of 306.6 ± 59.58 mg\/day.

        "Published":"2016-08-25",
        "Abstract":"Gout is a progressive, painful, debilitating form of inflammatory arthritis. It is caused by factors that elevate the concentration of serum uric acid (sUA), leading to hyperuricemia (sUA >6.8 mg\/dL). Continued elevated sUA can result in monosodium urate (MSU) crystal deposition in joints and soft tissues, and can cause acute and chronic inflammation. The prevalence of hyperuricemia and gout has increased over the last few decades, likely due to an aging population, changes in lifestyles and diet, and an increase in gout-associated comorbidities. Untreated or improperly treated gout can lead to chronic manifestation of the disease, including persistent inflammation, increased number of flares, development of tophi, and structural joint damage. Data show that even when patients are asymptomatic, ongoing inflammation and subsequent damage occurs locally at the joint and systemically. The aim of long-term treatment of gout is to reduce sUA levels to <6 mg\/dL, which is below the saturation point of MSU (6.8 mg\/dL), to inhibit formation of new crystals and to promote dissolution of existing crystals. Gout treatment should improve disease outcomes by eliminating gout flares, inducing long-term resolution of tophi, and more effectively managing comorbidities, many of which are associated with hyperuricemia. A number of studies have demonstrated that treating to the target of <6 mg\/dL, by using effective therapies to lower sUA, results in reduction in the incidence of gout flares as well as shrinkage and eventual disappearance of tophi. Gout is often poorly managed due to a number of factors including lack of physician and patient adherence to treatment guidelines. Patients need to be educated about their diagnosis and management of the disease, such as the influence of diet and the importance of compliance with long-term treatment. With treatment, regular sUA monitoring, and patient adherence, gout is a curable disease.",

Before and after hypouricemic treatment, serum uric acid level was measured, and plain radiography was performed to measure gouty tophi size. The tophi were graded by measuring the maximum vertical and horizontal diameters, and they were scored by adding up the scores of the grades. The vertical diameter was measured on both sides of the proximal phalanges (PPs). The horizontal diameter was measured on the lateral side of the PPs. The maximum vertical diameter measurement was graded 0-4. The maximum horizontal diameter measurement was graded 0-3.\nRESULTS: Seven hundred first metatarsal phalangeal joints (MTPJ) of 350 patients with gout were assessed for gouty tophi. Tophi were observed using plain radiography in 174 MTPJs (24.9%) of 109 patients (31.1%). Follow-up plain radiography was performed in 60 of these patients. Before the treatment, the average serum uric acid level of these patients was 8.3 ± 1.9 mg\/dL, and the average tophi score was 3.7 ± 2.5.

It is less clear if changes in SUA are associated to different incidence in these main cardiovascular risk factors.\nMETHODS: From the cohort of the Brisighella Heart Study, we selected non-diabetic subjects that in 2008 were untreated with SUA-lowering drugs nor antihypertensive ones. Then we divided the subjects in four main groups: the ones that maintained their SUA level unchanged during the next 4 years, the ones that increased it >1 mg\/dL without treatment, the ones that reduced it >1 mg\/dL without drug treatment and the ones that reduced it >1 mg\/dL with the continuous use of allopurinol.\nRESULTS: Compared with 2008, SBP significantly increased in subjects with worsened (and untreated) SUA level, while improved in subjects treated with allopurinol (p < 0.05). In 2012, subjects with worsened (and untreated) SUA level had a significantly higher SBP compared with subjects with unchanged SUA and those with SUA improved after allopurinol treatment (p < 0.05).

        "Abstract":"OBJECTIVE: To detect evolution of ultrasonographic signs of deposition of monosodium urate crystals (MSUC) in gouty joints by serial ultrasonography after initiation of urate-lowering therapy (ULT).\nMETHODS: Adult gout patients were examined by serial ultrasonography after initiation of ULT with target serum uric acid (SUA) < 6 mg\/dL.\nRESULTS: Thirty-eight male patients with gout with mean age of 50 ± 11 years, median disease duration of 48 months and baseline mean SUA level of 8.8 ± 1.5 mg\/dL were recruited. Ultrasonographic evidence of MSUC deposition was detected in 89.74% of first metatarsophalangeal (MTP) joints and 27.63% of knee joints. Double contour sign (DCS), tophi, and hyperechoic spots (HES) were detected in 77.63%, 43.42%, and 19.74% of first MTPs, respectively. SUA level normalizes and plateaus after fourth month of follow-up. DCS thickness reduced significantly throughout the follow-up period. Overall, 86.25% DCS and 100% HES disappeared with median time of 6 months and 5.7 months, respectively. SUA normalization was the only significant predictor of DCS disappearance.\nCONCLUSIONS: Serial ultrasonographic determination of DCS, tophi, or HES during hypouricemic therapy is a noninvasive, effective method to detect the lowering of burden of urate load in gouty joints.",

        "Abstract":"INTRODUCTION The management of gout is challenging and mainly occurs in primary care. This study aims to explore the experience of treating gout among primary care clinicians and understand the perceived barriers to effective therapy. METHODS Fourteen health professionals from primary care practices in South Auckland were recruited. Each participated in a semi-structured interview exploring their experience of treating and managing gout patients were analysed thematically. FINDINGS Participants described the large burden of gout in their communities and the importance of the clinician-patient relationship in gout management. Four themes summarise the perceived barriers to effective urate lowering therapy (ULT); unique gout factors, eg its intermittent nature and potential for stigmatisation; systemic barriers to optimal treatment, or barriers that emerge from working within a certain organisation; uncertainty about ownership, or who should carry responsibility for overcoming barriers to optimal treatment; and cultural barriers to optimal treatment. CONCLUSION Clinicians in primary practice perceive gout management to be mainly acute rather than preventive care. Patients may be stigmatised and management difficult particularly when diet is emphasised over ULT. Practice nurses are a group potentially available and willing to assist in educating patients. These findings may be helpful in planning for and improving healthcare in gout. KEYWORDS Gout; general practice; uric acid; primary health care; allopurinol; primary prevention.",

        "Abstract":"Chronic kidney disease (CKD) is a common condition that has become a significant public health concern. The mainstay therapeutic approach to CKD is based on renin-angiotensin system blockade as well as blood pressure and glycemic control. Despite these interventions, the management of CKD remains suboptimal, with a large proportion of the CKD population progressing to end-stage renal disease. Newer strategies for the treatment of CKD have emerged over the past years focusing on decreasing inflammation and delaying the development of fibrosis. Despite promising results in experimental models and small randomized studies, adequately powered randomized trials are required to evaluate the benefits and risks of these therapies in the CKD population. In this review, we discuss the evidence behind, and gaps in our knowledge of, established therapies as well as newer potential strategies for managing CKD, concentrating on interventions that currently are being evaluated in randomized studies.",

        "Abstract":"AIM: The aim of this study is to evaluate the diagnostic yield of dual-energy computed tomography (DECT) in detection of uric acid accumulation in joints or periarticular structures in patients suspected of having gout, in their intercritical period.\nMETHODS: Patients with a history of recurrent, short-lived mono- or oligo-arthralgia or arthritis, referred to the rheumatology clinic for diagnosis of their condition, were included in this retrospective evaluation.\nRESULTS: DECT confirmed the diagnosis of gout in 30 of 50 patients (60%). A positive DECT was present in 12 of 16 cases (75%) with serum uric acid > 8.5 mg\/dL, compared to seven of 13 cases (54%) and two of five cases (40%) with levels of 6.1-8.5 mg\/dL and ≤ 6 mg\/dL, respectively. The diagnostic impact of screening hands and feet were highest (78% and 56%, respectively). Follow-up data were available for 24 of the 30 patients with urate deposits identified by DECT. Twenty-one were treated with urate-lowering agents, all responded with lowering of serum uric acid and cessation of flares. Follow-up data were available for 16 of the 20 patients with no urate deposits identified by DECT. Gout was diagnosed in two of them by synovial fluid examination during subsequent flares. Both positive and negative predictive values of DECT for diagnosing gout in this patient population were 87%. Following DECT, treatment regimen was modified to gout-specific therapy in 52% of the patients.\nDISCUSSION: The ability to make a definite diagnosis of gout by DECT imaging in a substantial number of asymptomatic patients in the intercritical period should help in treatment decision-making and improve patient adherence to long-term urate-lowering therapy.",

        "Abstract":"BACKGROUND: New drugs and new evidence concerning the use of established treatments have become available since the publication of the first European League Against Rheumatism (EULAR) recommendations for the management of gout, in 2006. This situation has prompted a systematic review and update of the 2006 recommendations.\nMETHODS: The EULAR task force consisted of 15 rheumatologists, 1 radiologist, 2 general practitioners, 1 research fellow, 2 patients and 3 experts in epidemiology\/methodology from 12 European countries. A systematic review of the literature concerning all aspects of gout treatments was performed. Subsequently, recommendations were formulated by use of a Delphi consensus approach.\nRESULTS: Three overarching principles and 11 key recommendations were generated. For the treatment of flare, colchicine, non-steroidal anti-inflammatory drugs (NSAIDs), oral or intra-articular steroids or a combination are recommended. In patients with frequent flare and contraindications to colchicine, NSAIDs and corticosteroids, an interleukin-1 blocker should be considered. In addition to education and a non-pharmacological management approach, urate-lowering therapy (ULT) should be considered from the first presentation of the disease, and serum uric acid (SUA) levels should be maintained at<6 mg\/dL (360 µmol\/L) and <5 mg\/dL (300 µmol\/L) in those with severe gout. Allopurinol is recommended as first-line ULT and its dosage should be adjusted according to renal function. If the SUA target cannot be achieved with allopurinol, then febuxostat, a uricosuric or combining a xanthine oxidase inhibitor with a uricosuric should be considered. For patients with refractory gout, pegloticase is recommended.\nCONCLUSIONS: These recommendations aim to inform physicians and patients about the non-pharmacological and pharmacological treatments for gout and to provide the best strategies to achieve the predefined urate target to cure the disease.",

        "Published":"2016-07-20",
        "Abstract":"BACKGROUND: Despite the availability of effective therapies, most gout patients achieve suboptimal treatment outcomes. Current best practices suggest gradual dose-escalation of urate lowering therapy and serial serum urate (sUA) measurement to achieve sUA<6.0mg\/dl. However, this strategy is not routinely used. Here we present the study design rationale and development for a pharmacist-led intervention to promote sUA goal attainment.\nMETHODS: To overcome barriers in achieving optimal outcomes, we planned and implemented the Randomized Evaluation of an Ambulatory Care Pharmacist-Led Intervention to Optimize Urate Lowering Pathways (RAmP-UP) study. This is a large pragmatic cluster-randomized trial designed to assess a highly automated, pharmacist-led intervention to optimize allopurinol treatment in gout. Ambulatory clinics (n=101) from a large health system were randomized to deliver either the pharmacist-led intervention or usual care to gout patients over the age of 18years newly initiating allopurinol. All participants received educational materials and could opt-out of the study. For intervention sites, pharmacists conducted outreach primarily via an automated telephone interactive voice recognition system. The outreach, guided by a gout care algorithm developed for this study, systematically promoted adherence assessment, facilitated sUA testing, provided education, and adjusted allopurinol dosing. The primary study outcomes are achievement of sUA<6.0mg\/dl and treatment adherence determined after one year. With follow-up ongoing, study results will be reported subsequently.\nCONCLUSION: Ambulatory care pharmacists and automated calling technology represent potentially important, underutilized resources for improving health outcomes for gout patients.",

        "Abstract":"BACKGROUND Gout is characterized by deposition of uric acid crystals (monosodium urate) in tissues and fluids. This can cause acute inflammatory arthritis. The 2015 ACR\/EULAR criteria for the diagnosis of gout include dual energy computed tomography (DECT)-demonstrated monosodium urate crystals as a new criterion. DECT is a spectral decomposition that permits recognition of different types of tissues based on their characteristic energy-dependent photon attenuation. A positive scan is defined as the presence of urate at articular or periarticular sites. CASE REPORT We describe a 51-year-old woman known to have anorexia nervosa. During our clinical examination, we detected plenty of tophi on both hands, but no swollen joints. The diagnosis of gout was made by visualizing crystals in a biopsy from a tophus. The first line of treatment was allopurinol, the second line was rasburicase, and the current treatment is febuxostat 80 mg\/day, allopurinol 300 mg twice a day, and colchicine 0.5 mg twice a day. The patient has unchanged arthralgia and the size and number of tophi remain the same as before treatment in spite of active treatment for 3 years. Previously the patient had problems with adherence, but now she claims that she follows the proposed treatment. The last plasma urate (P-urate) was 0.57 mmol\/L. Following two years of treatment, DECT of hands visualized monosodium urate crystal deposits in the tophi, as seen on the clinical photos, but also crystals in relation to the tendons and soft tissue.  CONCLUSIONS DECT is an imaging modality useful to assess urate crystal deposits at diagnosis of gout and could be considered during treatment evaluation. Lack of adherence to treatment should be considered when P-urate values vary significantly and when DECT scans over years persistently visualize monosodium urate crystals.",

In Aotearoa New Zealand, benzbromarone has been available since April 2013, subject to funding restrictions, for patients with inadequate urate-lowering response or intolerance to allopurinol and probenecid.\nAIM: To assess the safety and efficacy of benzbromarone in a real-life setting.\nMETHODS: All patients who received funding for benzbromarone from 1 April 2013 to 30 September 2014 were identified. Prescribers were sent a questionnaire for each individual. Information on demographics, efficacy of previous urate-lowering drugs and reasons for discontinuation were collected. Specific information about the dose, effect on serum urate, adverse effects and liver function tests after commencing benzbromarone was recorded.\nRESULTS: Completed questionnaires were returned for 123 of 164 (75%) patients. Mean (SD) serum urate prior to benzbromarone was 0.57 (0.12) mmol\/L, and estimated glomerular filtration rate was 50.3 (22.8) mL\/min\/1.73 m(2) . The median dose of benzbromarone was 100 mg\/day (25-200 mg\/day). Six months after commencing benzbromarone, mean (SD) serum urate was 0.35 (0.12) mmol\/L. Benzbromarone-related adverse events included rash (n = 4), diarrhoea (n = 9), nausea (n = 6) and urate stones (n = 3). Liver function test abnormalities were uncommon and tended to be mild. There were 14 patient deaths; none was considered related to benzbromarone. Allopurinol had been prescribed prior to benzbromarone in 117 of 123 patients; median maximum allopurinol dose was 200 mg\/day (range 25-600 mg\/day), and 19% patients received allopurinol >300 mg\/day.\nCONCLUSION: Benzbromarone provides useful urate-lowering efficacy and does not appear unsafe in patients with gout.

Serum uric acid levels were measured at baseline and at the end of 4, 8, 12, 16, 20, and 24 weeks. Statistical analysis was done using GraphPad Prism Software 4.\nRESULTS AND INTERPRETATION: All active treatment groups showed a reduction in serum uric acid levels compared to baseline and placebo. Significant reduction in mean serum uric acid levels started as early as 4 weeks following treatment, compared to baseline, with T. bellerica (500 and 250 mg), febuxostat (P<0.001), and T. chebula 500 mg (P<0.01); an increase in serum uric acid levels was seen with placebo (P<0.05). The serum uric acid levels became steady after 16 weeks of treatment and remained the same until the end of 24 weeks. The reduction of serum uric acid levels in the T. bellerica 500 mg group was nearly twice that of the T. chebula 500 mg group as well as T. bellerica 250 mg group at all time points. T. bellerica 500 mg reduced serum uric acid levels from 8.07±0.87 to 5.78±0.25 compared to febuxostat, which reduced serum uric acid levels from 8.53±0.97 to 4.28±0.67 (P<0.001) at the end of 24 weeks. The efficacy of T. bellerica appeared to be dose dependent. All the formulations were well tolerated.\nCONCLUSION: T. bellerica has the potential for treating hyperuricemia as it was devoid of any serious adverse effects in the present study.

        "Abstract":"Uric acid (UA) remains a possible risk factor of chronic kidney disease (CKD) but its potential role should be elucidated given a fact that multidisciplinary treatments assure a sole strategy to inhibit the progression to end-stage renal disease (ESRD). In clinical setting, most observational studies showed that elevation of serum uric acid (SUA) independently predicts the incidence and the development of CKD. The meta-analysis showed that SUA-lowering therapy with allopurinol may retard the progression of CKD but did not reach conclusive results due to small-sized studies. Larger scale, randomized placebo-controlled trials to assess SUA-lowering therapy are needed. Our recent analysis by propensity score methods has shown that the threshold of SUA should be less than 6.5 mg\/dL to abrogate ESRD. In animal models an increase in SUA by the administration of oxonic acid, uricase inhibitor, or nephrectomy can induce glomerular hypertension, arteriolosclerosis including afferent arteriolopathy and tubulointerstitial fibrosis. The ever-growing discoveries of urate transporters prompt us to learn UA metabolism in the kidney and intestine. One example is that the intestinal ABCG2 may play a compensatory role at face of decreased renal clearance of UA in nephrectomized rats, the trigger of which is not a uremic toxin but SUA itself. This review will summarize the recent knowledge on the relationship between SUA and the kidney and try to draw a conclusion when and how to treat asymptomatic hyperuricemia accompanied by CKD. Finally we will address a future perspective on UA study including a Mendelian randomization approach.",

Participants were categorized into stable or progressors according to their change in albuminuria or chronic kidney disease (CKD) stage. At baseline, 68% patients had hyperuricemia (SUA≥420μmol\/l for men and ≥360μmol\/l for women and\/or allopurinol treatment). Five SNPs in the SLC2A9 and ABCG2 genes were determined by PCR.\nRESULTS: Time-to-event analysis with subgroups defined by the presence\/absence of initial hyperuricemia revealed significant differences in all three end-points (P<0.0001 for DKD progression, P=0.0022 for MACE and P=0.0002 for death, log-rank test). Subjects with normal SUA not requiring allopurinol had median time to DKD progression 49months compared with remaining subjects (32months, P=0.0002, log-rank test). Multivariate Cox regression model revealed hyperuricemia (i.e. high SUA and\/or allopurinol treatment) significant predictor of DKD progression independent of baseline CKD stage.

We found no differences in allele or genotype frequencies in selected SNPs between patients with and without hyperuricemia (all P>0.05).\nCONCLUSIONS: Our study demonstrated that initial hyperuricemia or need for allopurinol is an independent risk factor for DKD progression and that SUA levels in diabetic subjects conferring protection against DKD progression might be lower than current cut-offs for general population.",

        "Abstract":"OBJECTIVE: Our objectives were to determine whether a change in serum uric acid (sUA) resulted in a corresponding change in the fractional excretion of uric acid (FEUA) and whether the renal response was different in patients with gout versus healthy subjects.\nMETHODS: FEUA was calculated from previously published studies and four new phase I studies in healthy subjects and\/or patients with gout before and after treatment to lower or raise sUA. Treatments included xanthine oxidase inhibitors to lower sUA as well as infusion of uric acid and provision of a high-purine diet to raise sUA. Plots were created of FEUA versus sUA before and after treatment. For the phase I studies, percent change in FEUA per mg\/dL change in sUA was calculated separately for healthy subjects and patients with gout, and compared using Student's t test.\nRESULTS: Analysis of previously published data and the new phase I clinical data indicates that changing sUA by a non-renal mechanism leads to a change in FEUA. The magnitude of change is greater in subjects with higher baseline FEUA versus patients with gout. Healthy subjects excrete more urate than do patients with gout at physiological urate-filtered load; this difference disappears when the urate-filtered load is decreased to ∼5000mg\/24hours.\nCONCLUSION: These observations are consistent with a less saturated urate reabsorption system in patients with gout versus healthy subjects, resulting in elevated retention of uric acid. Further investigation could lead to the discovery of mechanisms responsible for the etiology of hyperuricemia\/gout.",

        "Published":"2016-06-18",
        "Abstract":"BACKGROUND: Xanthine oxidase inhibitors are anti-hyperuricemic drugs that decrease serum uric acid levels by inhibiting its synthesis. Xanthine oxidase is also recognized as a pivotal enzyme in the production of oxidative stress. Excess oxidative stress induces endothelial dysfunction and inflammatory reactions in vascular systems, leading to atherosclerosis. Many experimental studies have suggested that xanthine oxidase inhibitors have anti-atherosclerotic effects by decreasing in vitro and in vivo oxidative stress. However, there is only limited evidence on the clinical implications of xanthine oxidase inhibitors on atherosclerotic cardiovascular disease in patients with hyperuricemia. We designed the PRIZE study to evaluate the effects of febuxostat on a surrogate marker of cardiovascular disease risk, ultrasonography-based intima-media thickness of the carotid artery in patients with hyperuricemia.\nMETHODS: The study is a multicenter, prospective, randomized, open-label and blinded-endpoint evaluation (PROBE) design. A total of 500 patients with asymptomatic hyperuricemia (uric acid >7.0 mg\/dL) and carotid intima-media thickness ≥1.1 mm will be randomized centrally to receive either febuxostat (10-60 mg\/day) or non-pharmacological treatment. Randomization is carried out using the dynamic allocation method stratified according to age (<65, ≥65 year), gender, presence or absence of diabetes mellitus, serum uric acid (<8.0, ≥8.0 mg\/dL), and carotid intima-media thickness (<1.3, ≥1.3 mm). In addition to administering the study drug, we will also direct lifestyle modification in all participants, including advice on control of body weight, sleep, exercise and healthy diet. Carotid intima-media thickness will be evaluated using ultrasonography performed by skilled technicians at a central laboratory. Follow-up will be continued for 24 months. The primary endpoint is percentage change in mean intima-media thickness of the common carotid artery 24 months after baseline, measured by carotid ultrasound imaging.\nCONCLUSIONS: PRIZE will be the first study to provide important data on the effects of febuxostat on atherosclerosis in patients with asymptomatic hyperuricemia.

Although allopurinol therapy can control hyperuricemia, it has no effect on self-mutilation and neurological symptoms. Single reports describe a beneficial effect of S-adenosylmethionine (SAM) on the neurological symptoms, which motivated us to evaluate this alternative treatment.\nMETHODS: We performed a double-blind placebo-controlled trial to analyze the effects of SAM on self-mutilation attempts in a male patient affected by LND. The trial lasted for 282 days and comprised three alternating verum and placebo periods of 50 days each. The mother of the patient recorded attempts of self-mutilation during the entire trial.\nRESULTS: While verum and placebo were both well tolerated, a total of 1,762 events of self-mutilation were recorded, of which 1,281 events were in the placebo period and 481 in the verum period. The daily mean of events was 8.6 with placebo and 4.5 with SAM corresponding to a 50 % decrease in self-mutilation events under SAM treatment (p < 0.05).\nCONCLUSION: The results of this double-blind placebo-controlled single-case trial suggest that SAM can have a beneficial effect on self-mutilation in patients with LND, possibly by replenishing the purine pool in affected brain cells.",

        "Abstract":"BACKGROUND Hyperuricemia is very common after renal transplantation. It is associated with an increased risk of cardiovascular events and graft loss. To date, however, treatment is only recommended in symptomatic disease. MATERIAL AND METHODS We included 503 adult patients who underwent kidney transplantation at the Charité-Universitätsmedizin Berlin in this retrospective study. Patients were followed up for up to 120 months. All-cause mortality, graft survival, changes in level of serum uric acid (SUA), and estimated glomerular filtration rate (eGFR) were analyzed. RESULTS At 12 months post-transplantation, 225 patients had a serum uric acid (SUA) level >7 mg\/dl: 52 patients were treated with allopurinol, 37 with benzbromarone, and 136 patients received no medication for hyperuricemia (control). At 12 months, eGFR did not differ between groups (p=0.15) but treated patients had higher SUA levels (p<0.001) compared to the control group. SUA-lowering treatment was associated with a lower risk of all-cause mortality (p=0.013) and graft loss (p=0.014) compared to controls.

        "Published":"2016-06-03",
        "Abstract":"PURPOSE: Gout is a chronic disease characterized by the deposition of urate crystals in the joints and throughout the body, caused by an excess burden of serum uric acid (sUA). The study estimates pharmacy and medical cost budgetary impacts of wider adoption by US payers of febuxostat, a urate-lowering therapy (ULT) for the treatment of gout.\nMETHODS: A US payer-perspective budget impact model followed ULT patients from a 1,000,000-member plan over 3 years. The current market share scenario, febuxostat (6%) and ULT allopurinol (94%), was compared with an 18% febuxostat market share. Data were implemented from randomized controlled trials, census and epidemiologic studies, and real-world database analyses. An innovation was the inclusion of gout-related chronic kidney disease costs. Cost results were estimated as annual and cumulative incremental costs, expressed as total costs, cost per member per month, and cost per treated member per month. Clinical results were also estimated.\nFINDINGS: Increasing the febuxostat market share resulted in a 6.3% increase in patients achieving the sUA target level of <6.0 mg\/dL and a 1.4% reduction in gout flares during the 3-year period. Total cost increased 1.4%, with a 49.9% increase in ULT costs, a 1.4% reduction in flare costs, a 1.2% reduction in chronic kidney disease costs, and a 2.8% reduction in gout care costs. The cumulative incremental costs were $1,307,425 in the first year, $1,939,016 through the second year, and $2,092,744 through the third year. By the third year, savings in medical costs offset most of the increase in treatment costs. Impacts on cumulative cost per member per month and cumulative cost per treated member per month followed the same pattern, with the highest impact in the first year and cumulative impacts declining during the 3-year period. The cumulative cost per member per month impact was estimated as $0.109, $0.081, and $0.058 and the cumulative cost per treated member per month impact was estimated as $12.416, $9.207, and $6.625 in the first year, through the second year, and through the third year, respectively.\nIMPLICATIONS: Expanding the febuxostat market share would result in improved clinical outcomes, but with an overall increase in costs over 3 years due to higher costs of treatment. By the third year, savings in medical costs, primarily in chronic kidney disease costs, would offset most of the increase in treatment costs. Expanded use of febuxostat in the treatment of all gout patients, independent of renal impairment status, should be considered based on improved clinical outcomes and longer-term medical cost savings associated with these improved outcomes.",

        "Abstract":"BACKGROUND: Although international guidelines encourage urate lowering therapy (ULT) for people who have more than two attacks of gout, only 30 % of patients are prescribed it and only 40 % of those adhere to the treatment. The aim was to explore reasons for this through an exploration of patient experience and understanding of ULT treatment for gout.\nMETHODS: A qualitative study was conducted throughout the United Kingdom. Narrative and semi-structured video-recorded interviews and thematic analysis were used.\nRESULTS: Participants talked about their views and experiences of treatment, and the factors that affected their use of ULT. The analysis revealed five main themes: 1) knowledge and understanding of gout and its treatment; 2) resistance to taking medication; 3) uncertainty about when to start ULT; 4) experiences of using ULT; and 5) desire for information and monitoring.\nCONCLUSION: Patients' understanding and experiences of gout and ULT are complex and it is important for clinicians to be aware of these when working with patients. It is also important for clinicians to know that patients' perceptions and behaviour are not fixed, but can change over time, with changes to their condition, with dialogue and increased understanding. Patients want this interaction with their clinicians, through \"a joint effort over a period of time\".",

        "Abstract":"Whether renal dysfunction influences the hypouricemic effect of febuxostat, a xanthine oxidase (XO) inhibitor, in patients with hyperuricemia due to overproduction or underexcretion of uric acid (UA) remains unclear. We aimed to address this question with a modeling and simulation approach. The pharmacokinetics (PK) of febuxostat were analyzed using data from the literature. A kinetic model of UA was retrieved from a previous human study. Renal UA clearance was estimated as a function of creatinine clearance (CLcr) but non-renal UA clearance was assumed constant. A reversible inhibition model for bovine XO was adopted. Integrating these kinetic formulas, we developed a PK-pharmacodynamic (PK-PD) model for estimating the time course of the hypouricemic effect of febuxostat as a function of baseline UA level, febuxostat dose, treatment duration, body weight, and CLcr. Using the Monte Carlo simulation method, we examined the performance of the model by comparing predicted UA levels with those reported in the literature. We also modified the models for application to hyperuricemia due to UA overproduction or underexcretion. Thirty-nine data sets comprising 735 volunteers or patients were retrieved from the literature. A good correlation was observed between the hypouricemic effects of febuxostat estimated by our PK-PD model and those reported in the articles (observed) (r=0.89, p<0.001). The hypouricemic effect was estimated to be augmented in patients with renal dysfunction irrespective of the etiology of hyperuricemia. While validation in clinical studies is needed, the modeling and simulation approach may be useful for individualizing febuxostat doses in patients with various clinical characteristics.",

Due to the inappropriate high levels of uric acid compared to kidney function, screening of hypoxanthine-guanine phosphoribosyltransferase (HPRT) related diseases was initiated. Mutation analysis revealed a deletion of exon 2 and 3 of the HPRT gene confirming the diagnosis of Lesch-Nyhan Disease (LND). After initiation of allopurinol therapy renal function further improved. In the following months the patient developed clinically a typical neurological phenotype of LND and TSC with seizures, severe dystonia and developmental delay.\nCONCLUSION: Acute renal failure is a rare complication of HPRT related diseases.

Of 129 MOs, 42 responded. The overall response was 32.6%. On analysis, 65.1% felt their knowledge of gout to be adequate and 61.6% thought they had been educated well. In acute assessment, 59.1% of GPs responded that the diagnosis of gout best be confirmed with a joint aspiration and 36.4% clinical suspicion. Differing, 85.7% of MOs chose a joint aspiration. In acute management, if colchicine were used, 59.1% of GPs would give 1 mg followed by 0.5 mg an hour later, then 0.5 mg twice daily, compared to 9.5% of MOs, while 20.5% of GPs would use 1 mg twice daily. Chronic management was answered poorly. After an acute attack, urate lowering therapy (ULT) would be started 14 days after by 47.7% of GPs, compared to 69.0% of MOs. GPs were more likely to start ULT within 7 days (52.3% vs. 31.0%). With dosing of ULT, 45.3% would treat to target, while 46.5% would dose to the creatinine clearance.

        "Abstract":"Rasburicase has a strong and fast effect for reducing blood levels of uric acid. However, there have been no reports of theoretical analysis for the rational dose and interval of administration. Thus we constructed a pharmacokinetic and pharmacodynamic model to determine changes in uric acid level after rasburicase administration at various doses and regimens. The time courses of uric acid level predicted using our model were in good agreement with observed data, indicating adequate performance for our model. The therapeutic effects after a single infusion at various rates of generation of uric acid were predicted. The maximum effect was not a large difference, in spite of the generation rate. Then, the therapeutic effects of repeated administrations were predicted. The effect did not change when rasburicase was administered at more than the usual dose. Besides, as the administration interval increased, the difference between minimum and maximum level of uric acid became greater. However, in all doses and regimens, adequate therapeutic effects were obtained. In conclusion, the model was found useful for predicting therapeutic effect of rasburicase and individually determining rational dosage regimen of rasburicase.",

        "Abstract":"A 34-year-old woman was diagnosed with Drug Reaction with Eosinophilia and Systemic Symptoms (DRESS), most likelyrelated to a reaction to allopurinol.The patient presented with a 2-week history of a painful pruritic rash that started on her back and progressed to the rest of her body over a five-day period. The eruption started after several new drugs were started, including allopurinol for hyperuricemia. On physical examination, the patient had a diffuse morbilliform eruption and geometric intact bullae limited to the boundaries of tattoos.Most presentations of DRESS include a morbilliform eruption.  However, DRESS does not commonly present with bullae. There have been no known reported cases of bullae forming in the area of tattoos in cases of DRESS. This unique presentation suggests that a component of the tattoo or tattooing process alters the cutaneous immune response, creating an immunocompromiseddistrict.

The aim of this study was to compare the efficacy and safety of topiroxostat and allopurinol in Japanese hyperuricemic patients with or without gout.\nMETHODS: A phase 3, multicentre, randomized, double-blind, double-dummy, active-controlled, parallel-group study conducted in Japan. Patients who had inadequate serum urate levels (a gout patient: serum urate level ≥416·4 μmol\/L; an asymptomatic hyperuricemic patient with specific complications (urinary lithiasis, hypertension, hyperlipidemia and\/or diabetes): serum urate level ≥475·8 μmol\/L; and an asymptomatic hyperuricemic patient with no specific complications: serum urate level ≥535·3 μmol\/L) were randomized to topiroxostat 120 mg\/day or allopurinol 200 mg\/day, with an equal allocation ratio, for 16 weeks. To prevent the onset of gouty arthritis by rapid serum urate reduction, these doses were increased in a stepwise manner. The primary efficacy endpoint was the per cent change in serum urate level from baseline to the final visit.\nRESULTS AND DISCUSSION: Overall, 206 patients were randomly assigned to topiroxostat and allopurinol. Two hundred and three patients (allopurinol: n = 105, topiroxostat: n = 98) received at least one dose of the study drug and had their serum urate level assessed at least once. The baseline characteristics were comparable between groups. The mean age of patients was 53·0 ± 11·4 years and 99% of patients were male. The primary efficacy endpoint was -34·3 ± 11·1% in the allopurinol group (n = 105) and -36·3 ± 12·7% in the topiroxostat group (n = 98). Non-inferiority of the serum urate-lowering efficacy of topiroxostat to allopurinol was proved by the predefined non-inferiority margin (95% confidence interval, -5·3 to 1·3%). The overall incidences of adverse events and adverse drug reactions were similar between both groups.\nWHAT IS NEW AND CONCLUSION: Topiroxostat 120 mg\/day provides non-inferior serum urate reduction compared with allopurinol 200 mg\/day and is well tolerated in Japanese hyperuricemic patients with or without gout.",

We evaluated the evidence that uric acid (UA) plays a pathogenic role in CI-AKI. Ten studies were eligible for inclusion for meta-analysis. Hyperuricemia predicted risk for cases with AKI in prospective cohort studies. Higher levels of serum UA (SUA), as defined by the authors, were associated with a 2-fold increased risk to develop AKI (pooled odds ratio 2.03; 95% confidence interval [CI] 1.48-2.78). Significant heterogeneity was found in cohort studies ( P = .001, I = 85.7%). In 2 clinical trials, lowering of SUA with saline hydration was significantly associated with reduced risk for AKI compared with saline hydration alone or saline hydration with N-acetyl cysteine. An analysis of 2 randomized controlled trials found that allopurinol with saline hydration had a significant protective effect on renal function (assessed by serum creatinine values) compared with hydration alone (mean difference: -0.52 mg\/dL; 95% CI: -0.81 to -0.22). Hyperuricemia independently predicts CI-AKI. Two clinical trials suggest lowering SUA may prevent CI-AKI. The mechanism by which UA induces CI-AKI is likely related to acute uricosuria.",

        "Abstract":"PURPOSE: A case of apparent rasburicase-induced methemoglobinemia and acute kidney injury treated with i.v. ascorbic acid because of suspected glucose-6-phosphate dehydrogenase (G6PD) deficiency is reported.\nSUMMARY: A 46-year-old African-American man with a recent diagnosis of multiple myeloma and renal insufficiency was admitted to the hospital with a cough, hemoptysis, and fatigue. His medical history included hypertrophic cardiomyopathy, ventricular tachycardia, attention deficit\/hyperactivity disorder, and pleural effusion. No treatments for multiple myeloma were started before hospital admission. Levofloxacin 750 mg orally daily for possible pneumonia, lenalidomide 10 mg orally daily, and dexamethasone 20 mg orally weekly were administered. Plasmapheresis was also initiated. Laboratory test results revealed sustained hyperuricemia, which was believed to be due in part to tumor lysis, and a single dose of rasburicase 6 mg i.v. was administered. Subsequently, the patient experienced a decrease in oxygen saturation. Methemoglobinemia was suspected, and the patient's methemoglobin fraction was found to be 14.5%. The patient developed worsening shortness of breath and a drop in hemoglobin concentration, consistent with methemoglobinemia and hemolysis. Ascorbic acid 5 g i.v. every 6 hours was initiated for a total of six doses. Because the patient was assumed to have G6PD deficiency, which was later confirmed, methylene blue was avoided. Within 24 hours, the patient's oxygen saturation values and symptoms improved.\nCONCLUSION: A patient with apparent rasburicase-induced methemoglobinemia and acute kidney injury was treated with i.v. ascorbic acid (5 g every six hours for six doses) because of the possibility, later proved, that he had G6PD deficiency. The methemoglobinemia resolved without worsening of renal function.",

        "Abstract":"Gout is the most common inflammatory arthropathy in the western world. Affecting millions and accounting for lost wages, increased health care costs, and significant disability, it remains a burden for those afflicted, their families, and the health care system. Despite the availability of a number of effective therapies, gout is often inadequately treated, and its impact on the patients overall health and well-being is underestimated by physicians and patients alike. For many decades, controlling acute flares was the priority in the management of gout. More recently, however, a deeper understanding of gout pathophysiology has resulted in a new appreciation that gout impacts the patient with consequences well beyond the episodes of acute inflammatory arthritis. Reflecting the chronic nature of the disease, gout treatment needs to be chronic as well, and aimed at reducing the underlying cause of gout-hyperuricemia-as well as the symptom of acute attacks. Therapy therefore requires both urate lowering and anti-inflammatory strategies. Unfortunately, the most commonly used urate lowering and anti-inflammatory treatments may be problematic in some gout patients, who often have multiple comorbidities that establish relative contraindications. Novel urate lowering therapies, and new medications to treat and prevent acute gouty flares, can not only improve care of the individual; they can also lead to a better discourse for the edification of those who manage and are managed for this underestimated disease. In this paper, we discuss new and pipeline drugs for acute gout, prophylactic anti-inflammatory therapies as well as urate lowering therapies.",

Serum uric acid (sUA) and urinary pharmacodynamic markers were assayed, and safety was assessed by collection of adverse events and assessment of safety labs, ECGs and vital signs. Administration of PF-06743649 led to rapid decrease in sUA in all cohorts; in gout patients, a change from baseline of 69 % was observed for the 40 mg dose. Urinary and serum biomarkers were consistent with inhibition of both URAT1 and XO. Although dosing was otherwise well tolerated, two subjects experienced serious adverse events of acute kidney injury. Both subjects exhibited increased serum creatinine and blood urea nitrogen in the first 3 days post first dose and were hospitalised. One subject exhibited oliguria for the first 24 h. Both subjects made a complete recovery with minimal intervention. PF-06743649 was effective at rapidly lowering sUA, but further development was terminated for an identified renal safety risk.",

Doses in these studies range from 1.5 mg to 7.5 mg. Our study evaluated outcomes in patients who received single 4.5 mg fixed-dose rasburicase. This retrospective, IRB-approved chart review evaluated adult oncology subjects who received fixed-dose rasburicase between January 2007 and April 2014. The primary outcome was percentage of patients with normalization of uric acid (level <8 mg\/dL within 24 h) after a single 4.5 mg fixed-dose of rasburicase. Secondary objectives were incidence of initial failure of fixed-dose rasburicase and normalization of uric acid in overweight (body mass index ≥25 kg\/m) versus non-overweight patients. Initial failure was defined as need for additional doses or progression to dialysis within one week of the initial fixed-dose. In the 128 patients included, the mean baseline uric acid level was 14.84 mg\/dL. Of the 112 patients with a follow-up uric acid level, 68% achieved normalization within 24 h of rasburicase administration. Thirty-eight patients received additional treatment: 10 received additional dose(s) and 28 underwent dialysis. Normalization of uric acid in overweight versus non-overweight patients was 66% and 73%, respectively.

However, the effects of hyperuricemia treatment on blood pressure and renal function in adult hypertensive patients with hyperuricemia remain unclear. A total of 137 hypertensive patients with hyperuricemia (96 men and 41 women; mean age of 67 years) who recently started taking xanthine oxidase inhibitors (allopurinol or febuxostat) as outpatients were recruited. Serum uric acid level, estimated glomerular filtration rate (eGFR, ml min(-1) per 1.73 m(2)) and blood pressure (mm Hg) were retrospectively compared immediately before and shortly after starting treatment with xanthine oxidase inhibitors. The mean blood pressure and the eGFR immediately before starting treatment were 128\/71 mm Hg and 44.6 ml min(-1) per 1.73 m(2), respectively. Although the eGFR decreased from 46.6 to 44.6 ml min(-1) per 1.73 m(2) before starting treatment with xanthine oxidase inhibitors, it increased to 46.2 ml min(-1) per 1.73 m(2) (P=0.001, compared with immediately before treatment) without any significant changes in blood pressure after the administration of xanthine oxidase inhibitors. Multiple regression analysis revealed that the increase in eGFR after starting xanthine oxidase inhibitor treatment positively correlated with the changes in systolic blood pressure and negatively correlated with the changes in uric acid levels and the use of renin-angiotensin system inhibitors. These results suggest that xanthine oxidase inhibitors may delay the progression of renal dysfunction in adult hypertensive patients with hyperuricemia.",

Patients completed these questionnaires: EQ-5D (3L), Patient Reported Outcomes Measurement Information System (PROMIS) Health Assessment Questionnaire (HAQ), and Work Productivity and Activity Impairment. Inadequate control was defined as the most recent serum uric acid (SUA) level > 6 mg\/dl (> 360 µmol\/l) or ≥ 2 flares in the last 12 months; adequate control as SUA level ≤ 6 mg\/dl (≤ 360 µmol\/l) and 0 flares.

        "Published":null,
        "Abstract":"BACKGROUND: Patients with chronic kidney disease (CKD) are at increased risk for developing gout and having refractory disease. Gout flare prevention relies heavily on urate-lowering therapies such as allopurinol and febuxostat, but clinical decision making in patients with moderate-to-severe CKD is complicated by significant comorbidity and the scarcity of real-world cost-effectiveness studies.\nOBJECTIVE: To compare total and disease-specific health care expenditures by line of therapy in allopurinol and febuxostat initiators after diagnosis with gout and moderate-to-severe CKD.\nMETHODS: A retrospective observational cohort study was conducted to compare mean monthly health care cost (in 2012 U.S. dollars) among gout patients with CKD (stage 3 or 4) who initiated allopurinol or febuxostat. The primary outcome was total mean monthly health care expenditures, and the secondary outcome was disease-specific (gout, diabetes, renal, and cardiovascular disease [CVD]) expenditures. Gout patients (ICD-9-CM 274.xx) aged ≥ 18 years with concurrent CKD (stage 3 or 4) were selected from the MarketScan databases (January 2009-June 2012) upon allopurinol or febuxostat initiation. Patients were followed until disenrollment, discontinuation of the qualifying study agent, or use of the alternate study agent. Patients initiating allopurinol were subsequently propensity score-matched (1:1) to patients initiating febuxostat. Five generalized linear models (GLMs) were developed, each controlling for propensity score, to identify the incremental costs (vs. allopurinol) associated with febuxostat initiation in first-line (without prior allopurinol exposure) and second-line (with prior allopurinol exposure) settings.\nRESULTS: Propensity score matching yielded 2 cohorts, each with 1,486 patients (64.6% male, mean [SD] age 67.4 [12.8] years). Post-match, 74.6% of patients had stage 3 CKD; 82.9% had CVD; and 42.1% had diabetes. The post-match sample was well balanced on numerous comorbidities and medication exposures with the following exception: 50.0% of febuxostat initiators were treated in the second-line setting; that is, they had baseline exposure to allopurinol, whereas only 4.2% of allopurinol initiators had baseline exposure to febuxostat. Unadjusted mean monthly cost was $1,490 allopurinol and $1,525 febuxostat (P = 0.809). GLM results suggest that first-line febuxostat users incurred significantly (P = 0.009) lower cost than allopurinol users ($1,299 vs. $1,487), whereas second-line febuxostat initiators incurred significantly (P = 0.001) higher cost ($1,751 vs. $1,487). Febuxostat initiators in both settings had significantly (P < 0.001) higher gout-specific cost, due to higher febuxostat acquisition cost. Increased gout-specific cost in the first-line febuxostat cohort was offset by significantly (P < 0.001) lower CVD ($288 vs. $459) and renal-related cost ($86 vs. $216). There were no significant differences in either renal or CVD costs (adjusted) between allopurinol initiators treated almost exclusively in the first-line setting and second-line febuxostat patients.\nCONCLUSIONS: Gout patients with concurrent CKD, initiating treatment with febuxostat in a first-line setting, incurred significantly less total cost than patients initiating allopurinol during the first exposure to each agent. Conversely, patients treated with second-line febuxostat following allopurinol incurred significantly higher total cost than patients initiating allopurinol. There was no significant difference in total cost between the agents across line of therapy. Although study findings suggest the potential for CVD and renal-related savings to offset febuxostat's higher acquisition cost in gout patients with moderate-to-severe CKD, this is the first such retrospective evaluation. Future research is warranted to both demonstrate the durability of study findings and to better elucidate the mechanism by which associated cost offsets occur.\nDISCLOSURES: No outside funding supported this study.

        "Abstract":"BACKGROUND: Control of serum uric acid (sUA) levels is very important during chemotherapy in patients with malignant tumors, as the risks of tumor lysis syndrome (TLS) and renal events are increased with increasing levels of sUA. We investigated the efficacy and safety of febuxostat, a potent non-purine xanthine oxidase inhibitor, compared with allopurinol for prevention of hyperuricemia in patients with malignant tumors, including solid tumors, receiving chemotherapy in Japan.\nMETHODS: An allopurinol-controlled multicenter, open-label, randomized, parallel-group comparative study was carried out. Patients with malignant tumors receiving chemotherapy, who had an intermediate risk of TLS or a high risk of TLS and were not scheduled to be treated with rasburicase, were enrolled and then randomized to febuxostat (60 mg\/day) or allopurinol (300 or 200 mg\/day). All patients started to take the study drug 24 h before chemotherapy. The primary objective was to confirm the non-inferiority of febuxostat to allopurinol based on the area under the curve (AUC) of sUA for a 6-day treatment period.\nRESULTS: Forty-nine and 51 patients took febuxostat and allopurinol, respectively. sUA decreased over time after initiation of study treatment. The least squares mean difference of the AUC of sUA between the treatment groups was -33.61 mg h\/dL, and the 95 % confidence interval was -70.67 to 3.45, demonstrating the non-inferiority of febuxostat to allopurinol. No differences were noted in safety outcomes between the treatment groups.\nCONCLUSION: Febuxostat demonstrated an efficacy and safety similar to allopurinol in patients with malignant tumors receiving chemotherapy.\nTRIAL REGISTRY: http:\/\/www.clinicaltrials.jp ; Identifier: JapicCTI-132398.",

        "Published":null,
        "Abstract":"OBJECTIVE: In patients with gout, serum uric acid (sUA) concentrations should be lowered at least below the target of 6 mg\/dL (even below 5 mg\/dL in patients with severe gout). To achieve this goal, urate lowering medications (ULMs) should be considered. Currently-used ULMs include xanthine-oxidase inhibitors such as allopurinol, febuxostat, as well as available uricosuric agents. However, evidence comparing these agents remains scant. We have conducted a systematic review and meta-analysis to retrieve evidence on the clinical trials on the above-mentioned drugs in the treatment of gout.\nMATERIALS AND METHODS: The following efficacy outcomes were considered in the meta-analysis: (1) % of patients meeting the therapeutic target for sUA level (<6 mg\/dl) and (2) percentage reduction in sUA concentration at the end of the study compared with baseline values. An explorative analysis on safety was also conducted.\nRESULTS: In total, 16 papers concerned febuxostat, 15 allopurinol, 4 benzbromarone and none involved probenecid. Overall, 70.7% of patients reached the target of sUA with febuxostat therapy; the reduction in sUA was 45.3%. Corresponding figures with allopurinol were 44.4% and 33.8%, respectively. The number of patients on benzbromarone (N=129) was too low to retrieve definitive findings. The advantage for febuxostat over allopurinol was evident also in patients with renal dysfunction. Safety analysis favored febuxostat over allopurinol (OR 0.85; 95% CI: 0.75-0.97).\nCONCLUSIONS: On the basis of the reported data, febuxostat can play a major role in the treatment of hyperuricaemia and gout. Febuxostat is a suitable pharmacological option for first line treatment of gout, given its established efficacy and safety, documented in a high number of clinical studies and in daily practice.",

        "Abstract":"Gout is the most frequent arthritis worldwide. Despite progress in therapeutic options the majority of gout patients are still insufficiently treated. International guidelines (ACR, EULAR, 3e initiative) clearly specify treatment targets: keep the patient flare-free and maintain a low urate serum level (< 360 µmol\/l). The treat to target strategy includes therapy of flares, urate lowering treatment (ULT) and prophylaxis of flares. Evolution of gout guidelines over several years shows a broader indication for ULT, mandatory prophylaxis of flares during the initiation of ULT over several months and an earlier start of ULT in patients with flares as soon as symptoms have diminished. Colchicine is the preferred specific flare treatment, Caution has to be taken especially in patients with kidney disease, patients with hepatic dysfunction or in patients with interacting comedication. Low dose oral colchicine is nowadays the standard flare treatment. NSAIDs and prednisone are valuable alternatives. Interleukin-1 blockers offer a quick resolution of flares and may be an option in patients with chronic gout and severe kidney disease. Xanthinoxidase inhibitors (XOI) are the mainstay of ULT, with allopurinol still being the preferred XOI. The recently approved XOI febuxostat is eliminated mostly by the liver and can induce a faster lowering of urate. Uricosuric drugs such as probenecid are recommended in patients with sufficient renal function in whom the treatment goals cannot be reached with XOI. In Switzerland, only the two gout-lowering drugs allopurinol and probenecid are available, which reduces the therapeutic possibilities. Treatment success is often hampered by malcompliance. Recent guidelines stress the importance of patient education to ameliorate compliance. Comorbidities such as metabolic syndrome, cardiovascular and kidney disease are often found in gout patients. Patients with severe kidney disease are the most difficult to treat: the choice of antiinflammatory treatment is narrowed, ULT has to be uptitrated very carefully and patients often suffer from repeated flares. Another factor associated with treatment failure is the low physician’s adherence towards the guidelines. Therapeutic failure can lead to chronic and refractory gout (polyarticular gout, uncontrolled flare activity, chronic synovitis, destructive tophi) which makes the further management very difficult. Most gout patients are treated in primary care settings. Patients with chronic gout or at high risk for development of chronic gout (in particular patients with severe kidney disease or patients transplanted) should be additionally treated by a rheumatologist.",

During the six months treatment period, levels of cardiac function, brachial artery endothelial function, inflammatory cytokines, and biochemical markers were routinely examined.\nRESULTS: After three months of allopurinol treatment, patients exhibited an increase in flow-mediated vasodilatation (FMD) of brachial artery, whereas, after six months of treatment, the cardiac function classification was improved; plasma levels of brain natriuretic peptide and tumour necrosis factor-a were decreased; left ventricular internal diameter was diminished; and the ejection fraction was increased (p<0.01 for all the parameters) in patients. Serum uric acid level was decreased during the treatment period for both groups, with no significant difference between the two groups. Liver and kidney dysfunction was not observed among the study participants, and no significant increase in creatine kinase level was detected for either treatment group.\nCONCLUSIONS: For non-hyperuricaemic patients with chronic heart failure, the addition of six months of allopurinol therapy was safe and effective. Moreover, in these patients, allopurinol treatment not only can significantly ameliorate the left ventricular function and reduce the level of inflammatory factors but could also improve endothelial function.",

        "Abstract":"Elevated plasma uric acid concentration is a risk factor for gout, insulin resistance and type 2 diabetes. Quercetin, a flavonoid found in high levels in onions, tea and apples, inhibits xanthine oxidoreductase in vitro, the final step in intracellular uric acid production, indicating that quercetin might be able to lower blood uric acid in humans. We determined the effects of 4 weeks of oral supplementation of quercetin on plasma uric acid, blood pressure and fasting glucose. This randomised, double-blinded, placebo-controlled, cross-over trial recruited twenty-two healthy males (19-60 years) with baseline plasma uric acid concentration in the higher, but still considered healthy, range (339 (SD 51) µmol\/l). The intervention included one tablet containing 500 mg quercetin daily for 4 weeks, compared with placebo, with a 4-week washout period between treatments. The primary outcome was change in concentrations of plasma uric acid after 2 and 4 weeks; secondary outcome measures were changes in fasting plasma glucose, 24-h urinary excretion of uric acid and resting blood pressure. After quercetin treatment, plasma uric acid concentrations were significantly lowered by -26·5 µmol\/l (95% CI, -7·6, -45·5; P=0·008), without affecting fasting glucose, urinary excretion of uric acid or blood pressure.

Following an initial 2-week washout period, over the next 12 weeks we made five measurements of serum urate levels along with assessments of adverse events (AEs).\nRESULTS: Forty-three out of 152 screened subjects (28.3%) were ineligible either because of the presence of the HLA-B*5801 allele or for various other reasons. The febuxostat group (n = 54) and the allopurinol group (n = 55) had no significant differences in demographic or baseline characteristics. From week 2 to week 12, the febuxostat group had a significantly lower serum urate level than the allopurinol group (p ≤ 0.001 for all comparisons) and significantly more patients with serum urate levels less than 6.0 mg\/dL. The serum urate levels of the febuxostat group declined by more than 40% from week 2 to week 12 and this decrease was greater than that in the allopurinol group (~30%). The two groups were similar in terms of AEs.\nCONCLUSIONS: Febuxostat was more effective than allopurinol in reducing the serum urate levels of Han Chinese patients with gout or tophaceous gout who were HLA-B*5801 negative, without causing any serious skin reactions. Febuxostat should be considered for treatment of Han Chinese patients with gout who are HLA-B*5801 negative.",

Each stage comprised a self-complete questionnaire, clinic assessment and computer-assisted telephone interview. In Stage 3 (2008-2010), participants were asked if a doctor had ever diagnosed them with gout. Additional data included demographics, comorbidities, laboratory data and Short Form 36 (SF-36). Participants were defined as having gout if they had self-reported medically diagnosed gout or were taking any gout-specific medication (allopurinol, colchicine, probenecid). Hyperuricaemia was defined as a serum uric acid (SUA) level >0.42 mmol\/L in men and >0.34 mmol\/L in women.\nRESULTS: The overall prevalence of gout was 5.2%. Males were significantly more likely to have gout than females (8.5 vs 2.1%, P < 0.001). The overall prevalence of hyperuricaemia was 16.6%, with being male again identified as a significant risk factor (17.8 vs 15.4%, P < 0.01).

        "Abstract":"RATIONALE AND OBJECTIVES: This investigation aimed to evaluate the impact on treatment regimen and clinical outcome of dual-energy computed tomography (DECT) in patients with suspected gouty arthritis.\nMATERIALS AND METHODS: We retrospectively analyzed electronic medical records (EMR) of 39 patients (36 male, 3 female; age range, 36-85 years) who underwent DECT of peripheral joints because of suspected gouty arthritis. We assessed the prior medical history, lab results, treatment regimen, and medications before and after DECT, and changes in subjective severity of symptoms as stated by patients in the EMR. The presence of monosodium urate (MSU) crystals in the index joint was verified with DECT.\nRESULTS: Several patients had a prior diagnosis of gout (n = 9), hyperuricemia (n = 6), rheumatoid arthritis (n = 3), or psoriatic arthritis (n = 3). Elevated uric acid blood levels were detected in 32 patients (82%) before DECT. On DECT, MSU crystals were detected in 23 patients (59%). Of the 36 cases, the current treatment regimen was modified after DECT to gout-specific therapy in 22 cases and other rheumatic diseases were targeted in 14 cases. Several medications were prescribed more frequently based after DECT compared to before DECT imaging, including steroids (n = 20 vs. n = 12, respectively), colchicine (n = 13 vs. n = 4, respectively), and urate-lowering medication (n = 18 vs. n = 11, respectively). A subjective reduction of clinical symptoms during cumulative follow-up was reported by 34 patients (87.2%).\nCONCLUSIONS: Both positive and negative findings of MSU crystals on DECT have a significant impact on the treatment regimen and clinical outcome of patients with suspected gouty arthritis and facilitate differentiation from other rheumatic diseases.",

        "Abstract":"INTRODUCTION: Hypereosinophilic syndrome (HES) is a rare disorder. It is defined as eosinophilia of greater than1.5x109 \/L persisting for at least 6 months or death before 6 months without an identifiable cause and with eosinophil-mediated organ dysfunction. We present a rare case of hypereosinophilic syndrome with severe hypokalaemia in a Nigerian female patient.\nCASE PRESENTATION: A 43year old food vendor referred to the Haematology Department, University College Hospital, Ibadan on account of a 6-week history of cough productive of mucoid, brownish, foul smelling sputum with associated breathlessness, high grade intermittent fever, and intense pruritus. She had accompanying non-projectile,non-bloody vomiting of recently ingested meals. There was absolute eosinophilia of 83x109\/L and bone marrow cytology revealed marked eosinophilia with blasts of less than 5%. She also had asymptomatic severe hypokalaemia (1.9mmol\/l) likely due to vomiting and reduced dietary intake. The aetiology of the hypereosinophilia could not be ascertained.She was admitted and commenced on intranasal oxygen, Tabs Loratidine, intravenous hydration.The severe hypokalaemia was corrected with IV KCL over 48hours followed with the administration of slow K tablets 600mg tds. She also had tabs Hydroxyurea for cytoreduction and Allopurinol to prevent hyperuricaemia. She improved with the above line of management.\nCONCLUSION: This appears to be the first reported case of HES with asymptomatic severe hypokalaemia in the literature. Being a rare disorder it could easily have been missed without a review of the peripheral blood film and marrow aspirate. This finding suggests a possible relationship between hypereosinophilia and hypokalemia which needs to be explored.",

We describe the case of an 87-year-old woman with hyperuricemia who developed classic Sweet's syndrome manifestations 8 days after being treated with allopurinol. Patient's symptoms included fever, painful edema in the hands and lower limbs with non-pruritic erythematous plaques topped by pus-filled skin blisters, right eye conjunctivitis, splenomegaly and joint pain. At the emergency department, blood tests showed neutrophilic leukocytosis, inflammatory state and altered liver function. During hospitalization, she received unsuccessful treatments with two different antibiotics (namely ceftriaxone and levofloxacin), while treatment with intravenous methylprednisolone produced a rapid clinical remission of symptoms, cutaneous lesion pain improvement, normalization of her body temperature and her blood values returned to normal. Use of the Naranjo adverse drug reaction probability scale indicated a probable relationship between the patient's development of Sweet's syndrome and allopurinol therapy. Because the signs and symptoms of Sweet's syndrome resemble an infectious process, the correct diagnosis may be delayed and inappropriate treatment regimen with antibiotics may often precede glucocorticoid therapy.",

The aim of the present study was to evaluate the pharmacokinetic properties and tolerability of single and multiple oral administrations of febuxostat capsules in healthy Chinese volunteers.\nMETHODS: This openlabel, single- and multiple-dose three-way crossover study was conducted in healthy Chinese volunteers. Subjects were randomized to receive a single dose of febuxostat 40, 80, or 120 mg in separate trial periods, with a 1-week washout between periods. Those allocated to the 40 mg and 80 mg dose continued into the multiple-dose phase, in which they received 40 mg or 80 mg once daily for 6 consecutive days. During the course of the study, blood samples were collected and the concentrations of febuxostat were determined using LC-MS\/MS. Pharmacokinetic parameters were estimated using a noncompartmental model. Tolerability was determined using clinical evaluation and monitoring of adverse events (AEs).\nRESULTS: 12 healthy Chinese volunteers were enrolled and completed 3 treatment periods. After oral administration of single doses of 40, 80, and 120 mg of febuxostat, the mean (SD) Cmax was 2,835.43 (1,136.41), 5,356.75 (1,711.33), and 7,718.21 (2,446.34) ng\/mL, respectively; the AUC0-48h was 8,821.10 (3,018.35), 17,854.46 (5,113.28), and 30,832.05 (10,992.20) ng×h\/ mL; the AUC0-∞ was 8,990.33 (3,046.14), 18,193.58 (5,160.80), and 31,466.93 (1,1074.74) ng×h\/mL; the t1\/2 was 5.95 (2.71), 9.41 (7.47), and 12.34 (10.34) hours; the Cl\/F was 4.81 (1.18), 4.70 (1.21), and 4.18(1.19) L\/h; and the Vz\/F was 39.66 (16.69), 62.72 (51.41), and 73.41 (64.84) L.

No serious AEs were reported, and there were no discontinuations due to AEs.\nCONCLUSION: The PK of febuxostat exhibited dose proportional kinetics from 40 to 120 mg dose. After multiple doses, the pharmacokinetic parameters of febuxostat were consistent with those after single doses. There was no accumulation in febuxostat exposure in healthy Chinese between multiple doses and single dose.

Whether lowering of urate by allopurinol improves the cardiovascular risk in hyperuricemic patients remains to be established.\nOBJECTIVE: Our objective was to investigate the effect of allopurinol on cardiovascular outcomes in hyperuricemic patients in an observational setting.\nMETHODS: We had access to a study population consisting of all patients from Funen County, Denmark with high urate levels (≥6 mg\/dL) from 1992 to 2010. We linked 4 registries; all blood samples, all in- and outpatient contacts in hospitals, all reimbursed prescriptions and causes of death. We identified all incident allopurinol users and matched them 1:1 to nonusers of urate-lowering therapy, with similar urate levels, by using propensity scores. Hazard ratios were calculated using competing risk regression model, with respect to Antiplatelet Trialists' Collaboration composite outcome (myocardial infarction, stroke, or cardiovascular death) and all-cause mortality.\nRESULTS: Among 65,971 patients with hyperuricemia, we found 7127 patients on allopurinol treatment. In the propensity score-matched cohort we found a hazard ratio of 0.89 (95% confidence interval, 0.81-0.97) for the main outcome among allopurinol treated compared with nonusers of allopurinol.

        "Abstract":"BACKGROUND: Gout continues to be underdiagnosed and poorly managed despite the potential for cure. US and European management guidelines recommend treating to target serum urate (sUA) levels of <6 mg\/dL (or <5 mg\/dL to durably improve severe symptoms), with use of regular sUA monitoring, but studies suggest relatively poor adherence to these recommendations. This study investigates the real-world state of gout management in the United States by describing the characteristics of a large patient population treated in primary care and rheumatology settings.\nMETHODS: A retrospective chart audit, conducted among 124 primary care physicians and 125 rheumatologists, included 1245 patients with gout. Physicians completed structured case report forms capturing 12 months of sUA laboratory values, flare counts, comorbidities, types and doses of treatment, treatment duration, diagnosis date, physician specialty and socio-demographic factors. Focusing on the xanthine oxidase inhibitors (n = 858), descriptive statistics and multivariate models characterized relationships between patient characteristics, disease control, and treatment.\nRESULTS: Only 83 (11%) patients achieved disease control, defined as a 12-month average sUA ≤6 mg\/dL, no flares, and no tophi. Patients with greatest disease severity (defined as sUA >6 mg\/dL, ≥2 flares per year, and tophi) were more likely to have kidney disease and other comorbidities. In a multivariate model, predictors of more severe gout were rheumatologist (vs primary care) management, febuxostat (vs allopurinol) use and presence of comorbid conditions.\nCONCLUSION: Our findings confirm the inadequacy of gout management in the real-world setting. Regular monitoring, including sUA measurement as recommended in guidelines, is important to assess gout control. Our analyses also demonstrate that patients with more severe gout are more likely to have comorbid conditions, be treated by a specialist and use newer therapies.",

Model flow based on guideline and real-world treatment paradigms incorporated gout flare, serum uric acid (sUA) testing, treatment titration, discontinuation, and adverse events, chronic kidney disease (CKD) incidence and progression, and type 2 diabetes mellitus (T2DM) incidence. Outcomes were estimated for the general gout population and for gout patients with CKD stages 3\/4. Modeled treatment interventions were daily oral febuxostat 40-80 mg and allopurinol 100-300 mg. Baseline patient characteristics were taken from epidemiologic studies, efficacy data from randomized controlled trials, adverse event rates from package inserts, and costs from the literature, government sources, and expert opinion. Eight clinically-relevant incremental cost-effectiveness ratios were estimated: per patient reaching target sUA, per flare avoided, per CKD incidence, progression, stages 3\/4 progression, and stage 5 progression avoided, per incident T2DM avoided, and per death avoided.\nRESULTS: Five-year incremental cost-effectiveness ratios for the general gout population were $5377 per patient reaching target sUA, $1773 per flare avoided, $221,795 per incident CKD avoided, $29,063 per CKD progression avoided, $36,018 per progression to CKD 3\/4 avoided, $71,426 per progression to CKD 5 avoided, $214,277 per incident T2DM avoided, and $217,971 per death avoided. In patients with CKD 3\/4, febuxostat dominated allopurinol for all cost-effectiveness outcome measures.\nCONCLUSIONS: Febuxostat may be a cost-effective alternative to allopurinol, especially for patients with CKD stages 3 or 4.",

This method included 4 regions, each scored 0-3, with a maximum total DECT urate score of 12. DECT scans from 224 patients (182 with gout, 42 without gout) were scored by 2 independent readers. Automated urate volumes were also measured. Paired scans from 8 patients receiving pegloticase were analyzed, and a timing exercise was undertaken. The properties of the DECT urate score were analyzed according to the Outcome Measures in Rheumatology (OMERACT) filter.\nRESULTS: The interreader intraclass correlation coefficient (95% confidence interval) for the DECT urate score was 0.98 (0.97-0.98). All scored regions contributed to the total DECT urate score. DECT urate scores and volumes were highly correlated (r = 0.91, P < 0.0001). Both DECT urate scores and volumes discriminated between gout and nongout control participants and between the tophaceous gout, nontophaceous gout, and control groups. Compared with urate volume, the DECT urate score had greater ability to discriminate between responders and nonresponders to pegloticase therapy (P < 0.001 for DECT urate score and P > 0.05 for volume). The mean ± SD time required for the DECT urate score was 121 ± 2 seconds and for urate volume was 240 ± 2 seconds (P = 2 × 10(-31) ).\nCONCLUSION: We have developed a novel semiquantitative DECT scoring method for measurement of urate deposition in the feet\/ankles.

Serious adverse reactions associated with allopurinol, while rare, are feared owing to the high mortality. Such reactions can manifest as a rash combined with eosinophilia, leukocytosis, fever, hepatitis and progressive kidney failure. Risk factors for allopurinol-related severe adverse reactions include the recent introduction of allopurinol, the presence of the HLA-B(*)58:01 allele, and factors that influence the drug concentration. The interactions between allopurinol, its metabolite, oxypurinol, and T cells have been studied, and evidence exists that the presence of the HLA-B(*)58:01 allele and a high concentration of oxypurinol function synergistically to increase the number of potentially immunogenic-peptide-oxypurinol-HLA-B(*)58:01 complexes on the cell surface, thereby increasing the risk of T-cell sensitization and a subsequent adverse reaction.

Hyperuricemia has been shown as an independent risk factor for acute myocardial infarction and an independent and conjoint association of either gout and SUA with total and cardiovascular mortality has been reported, with mortality impact in gout patients increasing with rising SUA concentrations, even for SUA levels in the normal to high range. These findings prompted a growing research interest on the possible benefits of uric acid lowering drugs in cardiovascular diseases. Indeed, clinical studies have reported on the beneficial effects of uric acid lowering drugs, in particular of xanthine oxidase inhibitors, in hypertension, ischemic heart disease and heart failure. Two main mechanisms have been claimed to explain the dangerous effects of hyperuricemia and, as a consequence, the benefits of uric acid lowering therapy: endothelial dysfunction and systemic inflammation. This brief review aims to summarize current evidence from human studies on the role of acid uric lowering therapy in cardiovascular diseases for practical and clinical purposes. The possible mechanisms underlying the benefits of acid uric lowering therapy are also addressed.",

        "Published":"2015-08-08",
        "Abstract":"Hyperuricemia has long been established as the major etiologic factor in gout. Alongside with an inflammatory state triggered by urate crystal deposition in the joints, hyperuricemia displayed additional pathophysiological consequences leading to tissue inflammation mainly in the vascular wall. Thus, therapeutic strategies used to treat hyperuricemia in the past decades have often been focused on limiting acute episodes. Recently, evidence has been accumulated suggesting that chronic urate deposition requires a correct treatment not limited to acute episodes based on the modulation of the activity of key enzymes involved in metabolism and excretion of urate including xanthine oxidoreductase (XO) and URAT1. The present review article will try to summarize the most recent evidences on the efficacy of XO inhibitors and uricosuric compounds in lowering uric acid levels in both the bloodstream and peripheral tissues. In particular, we will focus on the effect of novel XO inhibitors in counteracting uric acid overproduction. On the other hand, the effect of lowering uric acid levels via XO inhibition will be correlated with attenuation oxidative stress which leads to endothelial dysfunction thereby contributing to the pathophysiology of diabetes, hypertension, arteriosclerosis, and chronic heart failure. Hence, scavenging and prevention of the XO generated oxygen radical accumulation emerge as an intriguing novel treatment option to counteract uric acid-induced tissue damages.",

        "Abstract":"PURPOSE: Hyperuricemia\/gout and atrial fibrillation (AF) are two pathological conditions that are highly prevalent in type 2 diabetes and share multiple cardiovascular risk factors. However, the relationship between elevated levels of serum uric acid and risk of AF in type 2 diabetes is currently poorly known.\nMETHODS: We studied a hospital-based sample of 842 (male\/female = 463\/379) patients with type 2 diabetes discharged from our Division of Endocrinology during 2007-2011. Hyperuricemia was defined as a serum uric acid level >7 mg\/dl for men and >6 mg\/dl for women or allopurinol use. The diagnosis of AF was confirmed in affected participants on the basis of ECGs and medical history by experienced cardiologists.\nRESULTS: Overall, 243 (28.9 %) patients had hyperuricemia and 91 (10.8 %) patients had persistent or permanent AF. Compared with those with normal serum uric acid levels, patients with hyperuricemia had a remarkably greater prevalence of AF (20.6 vs. 7.1 %; p < 0.001). Hyperuricemia was significantly associated with an increased risk of prevalent AF (odds ratio 3.41, 95 % CI 2.19-5.32; p < 0.001). Adjustments for age, sex, smoking, hemoglobin A1c, hypertension status, chronic kidney disease, chronic obstructive pulmonary disease and previous histories of hyperthyroidism, ischemic heart disease and valvular heart diseases did not weaken this association (adjusted-odds ratio 6.27, 95 % CI 1.82-21.5; p < 0.01).\nCONCLUSIONS: These results indicate that hyperuricemia is associated with an increased prevalence of AF in hospitalized patients with type 2 diabetes, independently of multiple risk factors and potential confounders.",

        "Abstract":"There are several therapeutic strategies available for the treatment of an acute gout attack and the prevention of recurrent gout flares, and they include nonsteroid anti-inflammatory drugs. This prospective study was aimed at evaluating the efficiency and safety of diacerein in combination with febuxostat on urate control, global assessments of disease activity, self-monitored gouty acute flare times, inflammatory markers, and clinical symptoms associated with their life quantity in patients with refractory gout. A total of 64 patients with refractory gout were sequentially recruited and prescribed with oral febuxostat alone or febuxostat plus diacerein daily for 12 weeks. The intensity of joint pain, numbers of acute flare, disease activity and the levels of serum amyloid A, mature IL-1β, IL-18, C-reactive protein, and urate in individual subjects were routine analyzed. In comparison with that treatment with febuxostat alone, treatment with both drugs for 12 weeks had a better therapeutic effect on reducing the values of visual analog scales, acute flares, and healthy assessment questionnaire scores in these gout patients. Furthermore, treatment with both drugs also significantly reduced the mean daily dose of etoricoxib and the levels of serum IL-1β and serum amyloid A. There was no significant difference in the frequency of patients with adverse effect between these 2 groups of patients. In conclusion, combination of diacerein and febuxostat had better therapeutic effect on reducing acute gout flares, inflammation, and clinical symptoms in patients with refractory gout.",

        "Abstract":"AIM: To review inpatient management of acute gout in a New Zealand hospital.\nMETHODS: A retrospective file review of all acute episodes of gout at Hutt Hospital, Wellington, New Zealand over a 1 year period.\nRESULTS: In the course of a year, there were 90 admissions for, or complicated by, acute gout. In 31 cases, gout was the primary diagnosis. Median length of stay was 5 days and readmissions were common. The majority of patients (87%) were known to have gout before admission, yet only 50% of these patients were on uric acid lowering treatment. Serum urate was measured in only 60% of patients with a mean level of 0.471 mmol\/L. Treatment for the acute attack was evenly split between monotherapy (49%) and polytherapy (49%). Treatment modalities used were: prednisone (61%), non-steroidal anti-inflammatories (40%), colchicine (40%), adrenocorticotrophic hormone (ACTH) (15%) and intrarticular steroids (7%). Patients were generally treated in a timely manner with few patients experiencing delays. Patients seen by the Rheumatology Department were more likely to receive polytherapy, be treated with intra-articular steroids or ACTH and to start allopurinol. The 'treat-to-target' approach to the management of elevated serum urate was mentioned in only 9% of cases.\nCONCLUSION: There was considerable variability in the investigation and management of acute gout, with significant deviation from published protocols. The 'treat-to-target' approach to the management of elevated urate has not yet been widely adopted by the physicians in this New Zealand hospital.",

        "Abstract":"To identify adherence and persistence levels with urate-lowering therapies using the national administrative pharmacy claim database. This was a retrospective, pharmacy claims-based analysis of dispensed anti-gout medications on the Irish national HSE-PCRS scheme database between January 2008 and December 2012. Adherence is defined by the medication possession ratio (MPR), and patients were considered to be adherent if the MPR ≥80 % (good adherers) in any given time period. Persistence was defined as continued use of therapy with no periods exceeding a refill gap of >63 days (9 weeks). Logistic regression analysis was used to predict odd ratios (OR) and 95 % confidence interval (CI) for persistence and adherence in relation to age, gender and level of comorbidity. There was a 53 % increase in the number of patients prescribed anti-gout medications between 2008 and 2012 with an increase of 27 % in the associated ingredient cost of these medications. Allopurinol accounted for 87 % of the prescribing and febuxostat accounted for a further 9 %. In patients who started on 100 mg allopurinol, only 14.6 % were titrated to the 300 mg dose. For all those initiating urate-lowering therapies, 45.8 % of patients were persistent with treatment at 6 months decreasing to 22.6 % at 12 months. In multivariate analysis, females had poorer adherence (OR = 0.83 (0.77-0.90)), and increasing age was associated with increased adherence (OR = 4.19 (2.53-6.15)) Increasing comorbidity score was associated with increased adherence and persistence at 6 months (OR = 0.68 (0.59-0.79)). Adherence with anti-gout medications in this study cohort was relatively low. Sustained treatment for gouty arthritis is essential in the prevention of serious adverse outcomes.Significance and Innovations-Poor adherence to medications prescribed to patients for the management of chronic diseases such as gout is an ongoing problem which urgently needs to be addressed.-Some of the reasons identified for poor adherence to anti-gout medications include the risk of flare of acute gout with the initiation of urate-lowering therapy (ULT), poor response to ULT and persistence of attacks of acute gout, suboptimal dosing of allopurinol therapy and intolerance of allopurinol.-The results of this study identified adherence and persistence rates of approximately 50 % at 6 months which is in line if not lower than many of the other published studies to date which have measured adherence and persistence using pharmacy claims databases.-The results of poor adherence and persistence affect both the health of the patients with financial implications for the healthcare service.",

        "Abstract":"The purpose of this study is to investigate the effect of urate-lowering therapies (ULTs) on renal uric acid excretion in gout patients. This prospective observational study involved 106 primary gout patients and 51 healthy controls. Gout patients received ULT with either xanthine oxidase inhibitors or the uricosuric agent benzbromarone. Parameters such as 24-h urinary uric acid, creatinine clearance, uric acid clearance, glomerular filtration load of uric acid, fractional excretion of uric acid, excretion of uric acid per volume of glomerular filtration, and urinary uric acid to urinary creatinine ratio were used to evaluate the pre- and post-treatment renal capacity for uric acid clearance in gout patients and were compared with the values in the healthy controls. Compared to healthy controls, gout patients had higher glomerular filtration load of uric acid and lower uric acid clearance, creatinine clearance, and fractional uric acid excretion. After ULT, both the xanthine oxidase inhibitor group and benzbromarone group patients showed reduction in glomerular filtration load of uric acid. Creatinine clearance was significantly improved in the xanthine oxidase inhibitor group. Excretion function was remarkably enhanced in patients who reached the treatment target (serum uric acid <6 mg\/dl). Changes in glomerular uric acid filtration load were significantly correlated with changes in serum urate levels. Gout patients have impaired renal uric acid excretion. ULTs reduce renal urate load and enhance the renal capacity of uric acid clearance. Xanthine oxidase inhibitors showed superiority over benzbromarone in improving renal function.",

Demographic data, clinical and laboratory features were collected at the initiation of ULT, upon stopping prophylaxis, and 6 months after.\nRESULTS: The mean age was 52.2 years and mean disease duration was 25.0 months. The male-to-female count was 387 : 14. The most common ULT starting agent was allopurinol 83.8%. Colchicine (62.3%) was the most commonly prescribed prophylactic agent. During ULT, 134 of the 401 patients (33.4%) experienced at least one gouty attack in the period from stopping prophylaxis to 6 months later. The duration of prophylaxis was different between those with serum uric acid levels below 6 mg\/dL and those over 6 mg\/dL (P = 0.001).
