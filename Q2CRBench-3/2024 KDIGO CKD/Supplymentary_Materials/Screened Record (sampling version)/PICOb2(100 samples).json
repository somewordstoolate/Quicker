        "Published":"2019-08-05",
        "Abstract":"BACKGROUND AND OBJECTIVE: East Asians exposed to the urate-lowering drug allopurinol have a predilection for severe cutaneous drug reactions such as drug-induced hypersensitivity syndrome or drug reaction with eosinophilia and systemic symptoms (DRESS) and Stevens-Johnson syndrome\/toxic epidermal necrolysis (SJS\/TEN). Screening is recommended in patients of East Asian descent for the presence of  prior to allopurinol initiation to avoid these complications. Utilization rates of the  predictive screening test within the Greater Vancouver area, which has a population composed of 40.1% people of East Asian descent, are unknown.\nMEASURES: We identified cases of DRESS or SJS\/TEN due to allopurinol using the Vancouver General Hospital dermatology consult service database. We next compared the frequency in which the  screening test was ordered since 2012 to the estimated frequency of new prescriptions for allopurinol prescribed for the management of gout among the East Asians.\nRESULTS: We report 5 cases of East Asian patients exposed to allopurinol for management of gout between 2012 and 2016, who developed DRESS (4 patients) or SJS\/TEN (1 patient). All were of  genotype, representing preventable cases. The  test was ordered 6 times in 2012, whereas the estimated number of new cases of allopurinol-prescribed gout among patients of East Asian descent during that time period was 13. For 2012, testing was ordered for only 46% of at-risk patients.\nCONCLUSION: We continue to observe cases of severe cutaneous drug reactions among high-risk individuals due to allopurinol exposure. The  screening test for allopurinol hypersensitivity is underutilized in our geographic area.",

Further reduction of serum urate (sUA) levels below the threshold may dissolve crystals more rapidly. It is generally agreed that sUA less than 6 mg\/dL is acceptable as a therapeutic and long-term preventive target, with <5 mg\/dL for the most severe cases. The challenges that this approach in gout is facing include whether proposed targets are the best for desired outcomes, whether they fit patient-related outcomes, and whether they adequately balance effectiveness and safety.",

        "Abstract":"50\nXanthine oxidase (XO) is a critical target for the therapy of hyperuricemia and gout. In this study, a number of 3-[4-alkoxy-3-(1H-tetrazol-1-yl) phenyl]-1,2,4-oxadiazol-5(4H)-ones (3a-3w) were newly designed by a bioisosteric replacement and hybrid strategy with the hope of obtaining novel and effective nonpurine XO inhibitors. Subsequently, these compounds were synthesized through a three-step procedure, with good yields. In addition, the in vitro bovine XO inhibitions were measured by spectrophotometric determination of uric acid formation at 295 nm using allopurinol as a positive control. As a result, compound 3j was found to be the most potent XO inhibitor, with an IC value of 0.121 µM, which was approximately 63-fold more potent than allopurinol, and the analysis of the structure-activity relationships indicated that the hydrophobic group at 4'-position was essential for inhibitory potency. Additionally, the molecular modeling results showed that the 1,2,4-oxadiazol-5(4H)-one moiety binds to XO active site via various hydrogen bonds with Arg880 and Thr1010. Moreover, the compound 3j was demonstrated to be a mixed-type nonpurine XO inhibitor. Furthermore, the hypouricemic studies on a rat model, induced by potassium oxonate, demonstrated that serum uric acid levels could be effectually reduced by compound 3j at an oral dose of 15 mg\/kg. Therefore, compound 3j could be a promising lead compound for the treatment of hyperuricemia and gout.",

        "Published":"2021-01-06",
        "Abstract":"OBJECTIVES: To determine factors associated with gout flares in subjects treated with pegloticase.\nMETHODS: Gout flares from two randomised controlled trials comparing pegloticase (8 mg every 2 weeks [q2] or monthly [q4]) versus placebo were analysed. Responders had persistent urate lowering (<6mg\/dL) whereas, non-responders had transient urate lowering during the 6-month RCTs. Gout flares (self-reported) were defined as acute joint pain and swelling requiring treatment. Gout flare prophylaxis (colchicine, 0.6 mg once or twice daily, or a non-steroidal anti-inflammatory drug) was initiated 1 week before the first infusion and continued throughout the study. Plasma urate at the time of flare and the change in urate preceding a flare were analysed.\nRESULTS: Mean flare rates increased with pegloticase versus placebo during the first 3 months followed by marked reductions during months 4-6. The increase in flares with pegloticase during the first 3 months was most evident (p=0.0006) and the decrease during the second 3 months was least marked (p=0.0006) in subjects receiving monthly pegloticase. Fluctuation in urate levels was highest in monthly responders (p=0.002) and was associated with flare occurrence. Multivariate linear regression analysis indicated the only variables significantly associated with flares were treatment group and absolute change in plasma urate before flares.\nCONCLUSIONS: Pegloticase treatment increased flares during the first 3 months of treatment in all groups when plasma urate was significantly lowered and was followed by a decline in months 4-6 in patients maintaining a low plasma urate. Flares associated with pegloticase treatment were associated with decreases and fluctuations in plasma urate levels.",

        "Abstract":"INTRODUCTION: Pegloticase is a PEGylated uric acid specific enzyme indicated for the treatment of refractory gout. Anti-pegloticase antibodies contribute to high discontinuation rates, increased risk of infusion reactions, and early loss of drug efficacy.\nOBJECTIVE: To describe the use of methotrexate to recapture function of pegloticase after development of anti-drug antibodies while treating gout.\nMETHODS: We report two cases of using methotrexate as an adjunct to treatment with pegloticase for refractory tophaceous gout. We also present the results of a literature review on the use of concomitant immunosuppressive therapy with pegloticase to prevent anti-pegloticase antibody development.\nRESULTS: Patient A, a 55-year-old man with a history of tophaceous gout, was treated with pegloticase but developed high serum urate(sUA) levels prior to his third infusion. Adjunctive treatment with methotrexate restored pegloticase response and the patient's sUA levels decreased, and remained low for the remainder of his treatment. Patient B, a 36-year-old man with a history of tophaceous gout, was treated with pegloticase. Oral methotrexate was initiated at the first infusion. Low sUA levels were achieved but increased after a lapse in methotrexate compliance. Re-initiation of methotrexate restored pegloticase response and the patient tolerated subsequent infusions. Literature review identified three reports of successful use of concomitant pegloticase and immunosuppressive therapy for refractory tophaceous gout, including an open label trial with a subset of 7 transplant recipients, an additional case study of pegloticase treatment with one transplant recipient, and a case study of pegloticase administered with low-dose azathioprine.\nCONCLUSION: Prophylactic use of immunosuppressive therapy with pegloticase may enable sustained treatment and improve outcomes. Additionally, immunosuppressive therapy seems to show the ability to recapture pegloticase response after development of anti-drug antibodies. The use of immunosuppressants to prevent anti-drug antibody formation, recapture pegloticase efficacy, and reduce discontinuation rates warrants further study.",

        "Abstract":".-\n['2', '2']\nSerum uric acid (SUA) is significantly elevated in obesity, gout, type 2 diabetes mellitus, and the metabolic syndrome and appears to contribute to the renal, cardiovascular and pulmonary comorbidities that are associated with these disorders. Most previous studies have focused on the pathophysiologic effects of high levels of uric acid (hyperuricemia). More recently, research has also shifted to the impact of hypouricemia, with multiple studies showing the potentially damaging effects that can be caused by abnormally low levels of SUA. Along with these observations, recent inconclusive data from human studies evaluating the treatment of hyperuricemia with xanthine oxidoreductase (XOR) inhibitors have added to the debate about the causal role of UA in human disease processes. SUA, which is largely derived from hepatic degradation of purines, appears to exert both systemic pro-inflammatory effects that contribute to disease and protective antioxidant properties. XOR, which catalyzes the terminal two steps of purine degradation, is the major source of both reactive oxygen species (O2, HO) and UA. This review will summarize the evidence that both elevated and low SUA may be risk factors for renal, cardiovascular and pulmonary comorbidities. It will also discuss the mechanisms through which modulation of either XOR activity or SUA may contribute to vascular redox hemostasis. We will address future research studies to better account for the differential effects of high versus low SUA in the hope that this will identify new evidence-based approaches for the management of hyperuricemia.",

        "Abstract":"This review brings together concepts of uric acid metabolism affecting renal parenchyma and its function and the current therapies to reduce hyperuricemia (HyU) and avoid renal disease progression. High uric acid plays an important role in several chronic diseases including kidney diseases such as lithiasis, gout nephropathy, and preeclampsia. In the last 30 years, it has been shown that reducing HyU with low protein and low purine diets in addition to allopurinol creates physiopathological conditions that produce a slight increase in the glomerular filtration rate (GFR). In recent years, in a new era of research in clinical, genetics, pharmacological, and epidemiologic fields, they have been moving forward to support the idea that reduction in HyU could benefit the chronic renal failure (CRF) patients (stage III-IV), thereby avoiding the drop of GFR for undefined mechanisms. There are several clinical trials in progress that show the HyU reducing to very low values and an increased GFR. In a young population, when treating HyU there is a reduction in high blood pressure. There are some reports showing that HyU could play a role in the diabetic nephropathy. Therefore, there have been some speculations that HyU treatment could stop the progression of CRF modifying the natural history of the diseases. So there will be new clinical trials with old and new medication and metabolic procedure to maintain a very low blood levels in the unknown uremic toxin know as uric acid which seems to be the toxin to the damage kidney.",

        "Abstract":"BACKGROUND: Febuxostat immediate release (IR), a xanthine oxidase inhibitor, is indicated for the management of hyperuricemia in patients with gout by lowering urate levels. An extended release (XR) formulation of febuxostat was developed to provide equal or superior efficacy on urate lowering compared with the IR formulation and potentially lower the risk of treatment-initiated gout flares due to an altered pattern of drug exposure. The present study evaluated the efficacy and safety of febuxostat XR and IR formulations in patients with gout and moderate renal impairment (estimated glomerular filtrate rate ≥ 30 and < 60 ml\/min).\nMETHODS: This was an exploratory, 3-month, phase II, multicenter, placebo-controlled, double-blind proof-of-concept study. Patients (n = 189) were randomized 1:1:1:1:1 to receive placebo or febuxostat IR 40 mg, XR 40 mg, IR 80 mg, or XR 80 mg once daily. Endpoints included: proportion of patients with serum uric acid (sUA) < 5.0 mg\/dl at month 3 (primary endpoint), proportion of patients with sUA < 6.0 mg\/dl at month 3, and proportion of patients with ≥ 1 gout flare requiring treatment over 3 months.\nRESULTS: At month 3, all febuxostat treatment groups were associated with greater proportions of patients achieving sUA < 5.0 mg\/dl (p < 0.05 vs placebo). A greater proportion of patients receiving XR 40 mg achieved sUA < 5.0 mg\/dl versus those receiving IR 40 mg (p = 0.034); proportions were similar in the IR 80 mg and XR 80 mg groups. Higher proportions of febuxostat-treated patients achieved sUA < 6.0 mg\/dl at month 3 (p < 0.05 vs placebo) and experienced ≥ 1 gout flare (significant for all comparisons, except XR 40 mg). Incidences of treatment-related adverse events were low across all treatment groups; the majority were mild or moderate with no apparent trends correlating with IR or XR doses. The most common treatment-emergent adverse event was hypertension. One death (unrelated to the study drug) was reported.\nCONCLUSIONS: These exploratory data demonstrate that febuxostat (XR and IR) formulations were effective and well tolerated in patients with gout and moderate renal impairment.\nTRIAL REGISTRATION: ClinicalTrials.gov, NCT02128490 Registered on 29 April 2014.",

        "Published":null,
        "Abstract":"Hyperuricaemia (HUA) significantly increases the risk of metabolic syndrome and is strongly associated with the increased prevalence of high serum free fatty acids (FFAs) and insulin resistance. However, the underlying mechanisms are not well established, especially the effect of uric acid (UA) on adipose tissue, a vital organ in regulating whole-body energy and FFA homeostasis. In the present study, we noticed that adipocytes from the white adipose tissue of patients with HUA were hypertrophied and had decreased UCP1 expression. To test the effects of UA on adipose tissue, we built both in vitro and in vivo HUA models and elucidated that a high level of UA could induce hypertrophy of adipocytes, inhibit their hyperplasia and reduce their beige-like characteristics. According to mRNA-sequencing analysis, UA significantly decreased the expression of leptin in adipocytes, which was closely related to fatty acid metabolism and the AMPK signalling pathway, as indicated by KEGG pathway analysis. Moreover, lowering UA using benzbromarone (a uricosuric agent) or metformin-induced activation of AMPK expression significantly attenuated UA-induced FFA metabolism impairment and adipose beiging suppression, which subsequently alleviated serum FFA elevation and insulin resistance in HUA mice. Taken together, these observations confirm that UA is involved in the aetiology of metabolic abnormalities in adipose tissue by regulating leptin-AMPK pathway, and metformin could lessen HUA-induced serum FFA elevation and insulin resistance by improving adipose tissue function via AMPK activation. Therefore, metformin could represent a novel treatment strategy for HUA-related metabolic disorders.",

The control of blood uric acid (UA) is an important link to improve the prognosis of end-stage renal disease (ESRD). As a therapeutic drug for HUA, febuxostat is rarely studied in PD patients. The purpose of our study is to investigate the safety, efficacy, and effect on residual renal function (RRF) of febuxostat in patients undergoing PD.\nMETHODS: This is a retrospective single-arm cohort study. During the study period which from September 2016 to November 2020, 191 patients underwent PD at this hospital. Among these patients, 84 were administrated for over a period of 3 months and were eventually included. These 84 patients (51 males and 33 females; average age: 55.18 years) were undergoing PD complicated with HUA or gout who received febuxostat during a regular follow-up from January 2018 to November 2020. Serum UA (sUA) levels, blood routine, liver function, and RRF were compared before and after febuxostat administration. Adverse events (AEs) resulting from febuxostat treatment were collected from medical records.\nRESULTS: All 84 patients were administered febuxostat for over 3 months, including 39 for over 6 months and 26 for over 12 months. Some 60 patients were treated with febuxostat dose of 20 mg\/day and the remaining 24 patients received 40 mg\/day. Compared with pretreatment level, the mean sUA level was observed to be markedly reduced at 1 month after febuxostat administration (320.2±87.27 vs. 498.8±81.47 µmol\/L, P<0.0001) and at 3 months (291.6±82.66 vs. 498.8±81.47 µmol\/L, P<0.0001) and subsequently remained at a significantly low level for 12 months. Only 5 patients stopped febuxostat because of its associated AEs. An initial dose of 40 mg\/day was associated with a higher rate of AEs compared with dose of 20 mg\/day (25% vs. 18.33%, respectively). After febuxostat treatment, no significant differences were observed between RRF in the two groups.\nCONCLUSIONS: Febuxostat may be safe and efficient in patients undergoing PD and may not impair RRF. Febuxostat administration at dose of 20 mg\/day may be an appropriate dose for patients undergoing PD.",

Moreover, it remains elusive whether serum uric acid (SUA) lowering therapy is associated with mortality.\nMETHODS: Retrospective analysis of 601 patients on chronic hemodialysis therapy in five outpatient centers with a maximum follow-up of 100 and a mean follow-up of 41 months. Death was defined as primary endpoint. Cumulative survival was analyzed by Kaplan-Meier analysis and Cox regressions adjusted for age.\nFINDINGS: Cumulative survival rates were higher for those subjects with a higher than median SUA concentration both based on mean annual and baseline measurements ( < 0.05 each). There was no survival difference anymore after adjustment for age ( > 0.05 each). Stratification for SUA lowering therapy (allopurinol\/febuxostat) had no impact on cumulative survival, neither in Kaplan Meier nor in Cox regression analyses ( > 0.05 each). Furthermore, Cox regression analysis excluded an increased cardiovascular mortality in subjects with hyperuricemia.\nDISCUSSION: In contrast to the general population, hyperuricemia is not associated with increased mortality in patients undergoing hemodialysis. Moreover, xanthine oxidase inhibition was not associated with a survival benefit in this analysis. These data do not support the use of SUA lowering medication in hemodialysis patients with asymptomatic hyperuricemia.",

        "Abstract":"In health-care, there is a need to quantify medical errors. Among these errors, we observe wrong dose prescriptions. Drug dose titration (DT) is the process by which dosage is progressively adjusted to the patient till a steady dose is reached. Depending on the clinical disease, drug, and patient condition, dose titration can follow different procedures. Once modeled, these procedures can serve for clinical homogenization, standardization, decision support and retrospective analysis. Here, we propose a language to model dose titration procedures. The language was used to formalize one- and two-drug titration of chronic and acute cases, and to perform retrospective analysis of the drug titration processes on 253 patients diagnosed of diabetes mellitus type 2 and treated with metformin, 321 patients treated of chonic heart failure with furosemide, 155 patients with hyperuricemia treated with allopurinol as initial drug and febuxostat as alternative drug, and 187 hyperuricemia patients with primary drug allopurinol and supplementary drug probenecid, in order to identify different types of drug titration deviations from standard DT methods.",

        "Abstract":"BACKGROUND: Hyperuricemia is associated with chronic kidney disease (CKD). Although topiroxostat, a novel, non-purine, selective xanthine oxidase inhibitor, has a strong effect against hyperuricemia, limited data are available on its renoprotective effect against CKD.\nMETHODS: This study was conducted between October 2014 and May 2016. Thirty patients (20 male, 10 female) were administered 40 mg\/day of topiroxostat twice daily. All patients were followed for a year. To elucidate the effects of topiroxostat, we evaluated the clinically documented primary indication of progression, viz. laboratory evidence of kidney function decline (reference indicator), uric acid, and hypertension in different patient groups, separated according to their baseline uProt levels and baseline eGFR.\nRESULTS: Topiroxostat treatment resulted in significant reduction in SUA (-1.53 mg\/dL), systolic blood pressure (-8.9 mmHg), diastolic blood pressure (-5.0 mmHg), and urinary protein excretion (-795.5 mg\/gCr) compared with baseline values. However, serum creatinine and urinary NAG levels, and estimated glomerular filtration rate did not change significantly.\nCONCLUSIONS: Topiroxostat reduced SUA levels effectively and may exhibit renoprotective effect in hyperuricemic patients with CKD. Further studies are required to clarify whether topiroxostat prevents the progression of renal disease and improves the prognosis of CKD patients.",

Some studies, but not all, have suggested that hyperuricaemia and gout are associated with increased risk of myocardial infarction, renal failure and death primarily because of increased risk of cardiovascular events. Therefore, knowledge of the effects of urate-lowering therapy (ULT) on co-morbidities, in particular cardiovascular events and chronic kidney disease, is crucial. Randomized controlled trials (RCTs) have suggested that allopurinol, a xanthine oxidase inhibitor, could improve exercise capacity in patients with chronic stable angina and could decrease blood pressure in adolescents. In contrast, a well-designed RCT found no effect of allopurinol in patients with heart failure. The impact of ULT in patients with chronic kidney disease is unclear. Some RCTs found that allopurinol could slow the decline in kidney function, whereas a recent controlled trial found no benefit of febuxostat. Large randomized placebo-controlled trials are warranted to confirm or not the benefit of ULT on co-morbidities.",

The aim of this study was to evaluate the dose-dependent relationship with serum urate-lowering efficacy and safety of topiroxostat in Japanese hyperuricemic patients including gout.\nMETHODS: We conducted an exploratory, phase 2a, multicentre, randomized, double-blind, 8-week, placebo-controlled study in Japanese hyperuricemic patients with or without gout. The study arms were placebo and topiroxostat 40, 60, 80 or 120 mg\/day. The primary efficacy endpoint was the per cent change in serum urate level from baseline to the final visit.\nRESULTS AND DISCUSSION: One hundred and eighty-seven eligible patients were randomized and 186 received at least one dose of the study drug. The study results demonstrated a dose-dependent serum urate reduction effect ranging from 40 to 120 mg\/day (P < 0·001, Jonckheere-Terpstra test). The mean per cent change in serum urate level from baseline at the final visit was -30·8% in the 120-mg group and 1·6% with placebo, with a between-group difference of -32·4% ([95% confidence interval, -38·9% to -25·9%]; P < 0·001). Incidences of overall adverse events (AEs) in the topiroxostat groups were comparable to those in the placebo group; however, the incidence of AEs in the 120-mg group was statistically lower than that in the placebo group. The incidences of gouty arthritis were not statistically but numerically higher in the topiroxostat 80- and 120-mg groups.\nWHAT IS NEW AND CONCLUSIONS: A dose-dependent serum urate-lowering efficacy of topiroxostat was observed in Japanese hyperuricemic male patients with or without gout. Further clinical studies aimed at evaluating the long-term safety and clinical efficacy are warranted.",

Risk factors include male sex; obesity; hypertension; alcohol intake; diuretic use; a diet rich in meat and seafood; chronic kidney disease; a diet heavy in fructose-rich food and beverages; being a member of certain ethnic groups, including Taiwanese, Pacific Islander, and New Zealand Maori; and living in high-income countries. Gout is characterized by swelling, pain, or tenderness in a peripheral joint or bursa, including the development of a tophus. Diagnosis of gout can be made using several validated clinical prediction rules. Arthrocentesis should be performed when suspicion for an underlying septic joint is present; synovial fluid or tophus analysis should be performed if the diagnosis is uncertain. Colchicine, nonsteroidal anti-inflammatory drugs, and corticosteroids relieve pain in adults with acute gout episodes. Indications for long-term urate-lowering therapy include chronic kidney disease, two or more flare-ups per year, urolithiasis, the presence of tophus, chronic gouty arthritis, and joint damage. Allopurinol and febuxostat are used to prevent flare-ups, although febuxostat is associated with an increase in all-cause and cardiovascular mortality and is therefore not routinely recommended.",

        "Abstract":"OBJECTIVE: To investigate the efficacy and safety of febuxostat on renal function in CKD stage 3 diabetic nephropathy patients.\nMETHODS: Patients in our hospital with chronic kidney disease (CKD) stage 3 diabetic nephropathy (DN) complicated by high serum uric acid (360 µmol\/L) were recruited. Patients were then divided into treatment group and control group according to the random number table method. All the patients received low purine diet, renin-angiotensin-aldosterone system (RAAS) inhibitors, and adequate routine hypoglycemic treatment. Febuxostat was employed only in the treatment group. The levels of blood uric acid (sUA), serum creatinine (Scr), cystatin C (cys-c), eGFR, 24-hour urine protein quantification, albuminuria, and creatinine ratio (ACR) were evaluated in all patients before and after treatment at 4, 8, 12, and 24 week.\nRESULTS: No difference was found before treatment between the two groups. After treatment at 4, 8, 12, and 24 week, the levels of sUA, SCr, cys-c, and eGFR between the two groups were significant different (P<0.05). There was no difference in 24-hour urine protein quantification, albuminuria, and creatinine ratio between two groups before treatment, and significant differences were observed after treatment. Fifty percent of patients from the treatment group achieved the treatment goal with 20 mg febuxostat at 4 weeks. Tubular markers were also decreased with the treatment.\nCONCLUSIONS: Febuxostat can reduce uric acid and improve renal function effectively in patients with CKD stage 3 diabetic nephropathy, while being well tolerated.

Blood samples were collected within 15 min of admission (Day 1), after 48-72 h (Day 3), and between Days 7 and 21 (Day 14). The AHF patients were divided into two groups according to the XOR activity on Day 1: the high-XOR group (≥100 pmol\/h\/mL, n = 85) and the low-XOR group (<100 pmol\/h\/mL, n = 102). The high-XOR patients were assigned to two groups according to the rate of change in XOR from Day 1 to Day 14: the decreased group (≥50% decrease; n = 70) and the non-decreased group (<50% decrease; n = 15). The plasma XOR activity significantly decreased on Days 3 and 14 [23.6 (9.1 to 63.1) pmol\/h\/mL and 32.5 (10.2 to 87.8) pmol\/h\/mL, respectively] in comparison with Day 1 [78.5 (16.9 to 340.5) pmol\/h\/mL]. A Kaplan-Meier curve indicated that the prognosis, including heart failure (HF) events (all-cause death and readmission by HF) within 365 days, was significantly poorer in the low-XOR patients than in the high-XOR patients and was also significantly poorer in the non-decreased group than in the decreased group.\nCONCLUSIONS: The plasma XOR activity was rapidly decreased by the appropriate treatment of AHF. Although high-XOR activity on admission was not associated with increased HF events in AHF, high-XOR activity that was not sufficiently reduced during appropriate treatment was associated with increased HF events.",

        "Abstract":"PURPOSE OF REVIEW: To discuss recent studies of lesinurad and arhalofenate.\nRECENT FINDINGS: Lesinurad acts by blocking urate reabsorption channels URAT-1 and OAT-4. It has urate-lowering effect when used alone and in combination with xanthine oxidase inhibitors (XOIs). Its uricosuric activity depends on glomerular filtration, and its' efficacy is impaired at eGFR less than 30 ml\/min. Lesinurad monotherapy (400 mg\/day) associates with serum creatinine elevations. However, this risk is substantially attenuated with coprescription of a XOI and when prescribed at a dose of 200 mg\/day. Given its' modest urate-lowering effect, and the risk of serum creatinine elevation when used alone, it is licenced for use in combination with XOI for people unable to achieve target serum uric acid with XOI alone. Lesinurad does not have the drug interactions associated with probenecid, however, it is metabolized by CYP2C9, and should be used with caution if CYP2C9 inhibitors are coprescribed. Arhalofenate also acts by blocking URAT-1; however, it also blocks the NALP-3 inflammasome providing gout-specific anti-inflammatory effect. Arhalofenate has a weaker urate-lowering effect than lesinurad and further phase III evaluation is planned.\nSUMMARY: Lesinurad provides an additional option for people with gout unable to achieve target serum uric acid with XOI alone.",

Xanthine oxidase (XOD) or renal urate transporter 1 (URAT1) inhibitors have been applied for hyperuricemia treatment in clinic, but available drugs could not simultaneously target XOD and URAT1 and had various adverse effects. (E)-2-(4-bromophenyl)-1-(2, 4-dihydroxyphenyl)ethanone oxime (BDEO), as a deoxybenzoins oxime analog, was obtained from a cluster of deoxybenzoins derivatives synthesized by our research group with potent anti-hyperuricemic activity, which was expected to be dual inhibitor of XOD and URAT1. This study aimed to investigate effects of BDEO on XOD and URAT1 in vitro, as well as the possible mechanism by which BDEO attenuated hyperuricemia in vivo. In vitro, BDEO obviously inhibited XOD activity with an IC value of 3.33μM, moreover, in Human embryonic kidney (HEK)293 cells expressing URAT1, BDEO and benzbromarone blocked uptake of uric acid with a Ki value of 0.145μM. On the other hand, mice were orally administrated by oxonate for seven consecutive days to induce hyperuricemia, BDEO at various doses were administered intragastrically to hyperuricemic and normal mice daily. BDEO dose-dependently decreased serum urate level and uric acid excretion in 24h in hyperuricemic mice. More importantly, BDEO significantly suppressed hepatic XOD activity and down-regulated renal URAT1 protein level in hyperuricemic mice. Notably, BDEO exhibited no effects on all these detected biochemical indicators in normal mice, predicting its safety. Taken together, the data suggested that BDEO may serve as a dual XOD and URAT1 inhibitor for treatment of hyperuricemia.",

        "Abstract":"['2', 'm', '2', '2']\nK\nBiological enzymes have high catalytic activity and unique substrate selectivity; their immobilization may provide cost reduction and reusability. Using magnetic nanoparticles (MNPs) as support materials for enzymes ensures easy separation from reaction media by an external magnetic field. Thus, MNPs were prepared by the coprecipitation method, coated with silanol groups, then -NH-functionalized, and finally activated with glutaraldehyde. Finally, three different oxidase enzymes, i.e., uricase, glucose oxidase, and choline oxidase, were separately immobilized on their surfaces by covalent attachment. Hence, colorimetric nanobiosensors for the determination of three biologically important substrates, i.e., uric acid (UA), glucose (Glu), and choline (Ch), were developed. Hydrogen peroxide liberated from enzyme-substrate reactions was determined by the cupric ion reducing antioxidant capacity (CUPRAC) reagent, bis-neocuproine copper(II) chelate. In addition, UA-free total antioxidant capacity could also be measured via the developed system. Kinetic investigations were carried out for these nanobiosensors to enable the calculation of their Michaelis constants ( ), revealing no affinity loss for the substrate as a result of immobilization. Enzyme-immobilized MNPs could be reused at least five times. The linear concentration ranges were 5.43-65.22 μM for UA, 11.1-111.1 μM for Glu, and 2.78-44.4 μM for Ch, and the limit of detection (LOD) values with the same order were 0.34, 0.59, and 0.20 μM, respectively. Besides phenolic and thiol-type antioxidants, UA could be determined with an error range of 0.18-4.87%. The method is based on a clear redox reaction with a definite stoichiometry for the enzymatically generated HO (which minimizes chemical deviations from Beer's law of optical absorbances), and it was successfully applied to the determination of Glu and UA in fetal bovine serum and Ch in infant formula as real samples.",

Arthritis can also be accompanied by urate nephropathy and subcutaneous urate deposits (tophi). Exciting new developments in the last decade have brought back the focus on this interesting, crystal-induced chronic inflammatory condition. New insights include the role of NALP3 inflammasome-induced inflammation in acute gout, the characterization of diagnostic signs on ultrasound and dual-energy computed tomography imaging modalities, the recognition of target serum urate less than 6 mg\/day as the goal for urate-lowering therapies, and evidence-based treatment guidelines. A better understanding of disease mechanisms has enabled drug discovery - three new urate-lowering drugs have been approved in the last decade, with several more in the pipeline. We now recognize the important role that environment and genetics play in the causation of gout. A focus on the cardiac, renal, and metabolic comorbidities of gout will help translational research and discovery over the next decade.",

        "Abstract":"OBJECTIVE: Pegloticase is used in severe refractory gout or in cases of intolerance to other urate-lowering therapies. We sought to evaluate the patterns of pegloticase use in the USA and the incidence of safety outcomes.\nMETHODS: We conducted a retrospective descriptive study using data from two US commercial insurance claims databases (2010-2018). We identified new initiators of pegloticase with ≥1 gout diagnosis code in the 365-day baseline period prior to pegloticase initiation. We measured the number and duration of pegloticase infusions. We assessed the risk of anaphylaxis or anaphylactoid reactions, cardiovascular events, including myocardial infarction or stroke, and hospitalisation for heart failure (new onset or exacerbations) while undergoing pegloticase therapy.\nRESULTS: Among 2.9 million patients with ≥1 diagnosis of gout, we identified only 483 (179 in Optum and 304 in MarketScan) pegloticase initiators. The mean age and % female was 55.6 years, 10.9% for MarketScan and 60.6 years and 17.3% for Optum. Hypertension was present in up to 85%, diabetes mellitus in 38%, chronic kidney disease in 46% and heart failure in 21% of the patients. The median number of infusions was four and the duration of therapy was 3 months. During the mean 0.5-year follow-up time on pegloticase, there were 3 (0.6%) anaphylaxis, 7 (1.4%) composite cardiovascular, 31 (6.4%) heart failure hospitalisations and 3 (0.6%) deaths.\nCONCLUSION: Pegloticase is rarely used in gout, and the median duration of pegloticase therapy was 3 months. There were few anaphylaxis events captured in this claims-based study, while heart failure hospitalisations were common.",

Propensity score (PS)-weighted Cox proportional hazards model was used to estimate hazard ratios (HRs) for CKD progression and improvement. A separate analysis was conducted to assess the HR for CKD progression and CKD recovery among those with worsening CKD.\nRESULTS: The incidence of CKD progression among allopurinol, febuxostat and uricosuric agent users were 1.98, 1.88 and 1.64 per 1000 person-days. Compared with allopurinol users, the PS-weighted HR (95% confidence intervals [CIs]) was 1.77 (0.85-1.76) for febuxostat users and 1.37 (0.71-1.37) for uricosuric agent users for CKD progression and 1.43 (1.26-1.62) for febuxostat users and 1.00 (0.88-1.14) for uricosuric agent users for CKD improvement. Compared to allopurinol users, the HRs for CKD progression were 1.14 (0.80-1.66) for febuxostat users and 0.92 (0.67-1.31) for uricosuric agent users. Among 741 patients who had CKD progression, the incidence of CKD recovery was 1.33, 6.21 and 3.53 per 1000 person-days for allopurinol, febuxostat and uricosuric agent users.

In this study, we explored the causal association between gout and antigout medication and the risk of incidental CAD. We sampled data from the National Health Insurance Research Database and recruited 37,091 patients as the gout cohort, and 37,091 controls. Our primary endpoint was the diagnosis of CAD during follow-up. The overall study population was followed up until CAD diagnosis, withdrawal from the National Health Insurance program, or the end of the study. Cox proportional hazards regression models were used to examine the effect of gout on the risk of CAD, represented by the HR with the 95% CI. Patients with gout were at greater risk of CAD, compared with those without gout: HR=1.49 after adjusting for potential confounders. Non-steroidal anti-inflammatory drugs and prednisolone use was associated with a reduced risk of CAD: HR=0.63 and 0.50, respectively. Patients with gout, treated with antigout medication, exhibited a reduced risk of CAD compared with non-gout patients. Among patients with gout, those on antigout therapy had 32% lower risk compared with those not on antigout therapy: adjusted HR=0.68, 95% CI 0.63 to 0.73. Gout increases the risk of CAD, and the use of antigout medication reduces CAD risk. These results indicate that gout or hyperuricemia is a modifiable risk factor for CAD.",

Uric acid-lowering drugs (ULDs) are used to reduce uric acid levels for the treatment of hyperuricemia and gout. However, there is a lack of robust and real-world data on the history and treatment of patients with newly diagnosed hyperuricemia or gout in Japan. This retrospective, longitudinal, historical cohort study determined the characteristics of patients with hyperuricemia and\/or gout, and prescription of, and adherence to, ULDs using data from the JMDC Claims Database. The primary evaluation population included 64 677 patients with newly diagnosed hyperuricemia and\/or gout. Of these, only 26 501 (41.0%) had a prescription for ULDs at diagnosis. Even when ULDs were prescribed, the persistence rate of prescriptions declined over time, with a 54.4% persistence rate for ULDs at 12 months after the index diagnosis. In subgroups of patients with or without hypertension and diabetes, the rate of ULD prescription continuation was significantly higher in those with comorbidities than in those without (76.8% vs. 42.6% in those with vs. without hypertension, and 78.7% vs. 52.2% in those with vs. without diabetes).

Late diagnosis of LND may cause significant morbidity. LND cases have never been reported in Indonesia. A 15-year-old male who had been diagnosed with cerebral palsy was referred to our hospital due to renal failure requiring emergency dialysis. The patient presented with three classic manifestations of LND: increased uric acid levels, neurological disorders, and self-injurious behaviors. LND was suspected because of an abscess-like lump on the left ankle that was confirmed to be a tophus, which had burst and discharged thick masses containing blood, debris, and white crystal materials. The diagnosis of LND was confirmed by the presence of a deletion to exon 1 of the HPRT1 gene. The patient received oral allopurinol daily and treatment for end-stage renal disease (ESRD), which included regular dialysis and subcutaneous administration of erythropoietin. At a 2-month follow-up, he improved clinically with a 71% decrease in uric acid levels after regular dialysis and allopurinol treatment. In developed countries, LND can be diagnosed as early as 3 days after birth. However, diagnosis in the present case was delayed due to the rarity of the disease and the limited number of facilities in Indonesia that offer genetic counseling. Late diagnosis of LND leads to ESRD and irreversible abnormalities. This is the first case of LND presenting with a unique clinical presentation of tophus burst reported in Indonesia.",

Prior distributions for treatment effects based on previous trial results risks sample selection bias and difficulties when a proposed trial differs in terms of patient characteristics, medication adherence, or treatment doses and regimens. The aim of this study was to demonstrate the utility of using pharmacometric-based clinical trial simulation (CTS) to generate prior distributions for use in Bayesian decision-theoretic trial design. The methods consisted of four principal stages: a CTS to predict the distribution of treatment response for a range of trial designs; Bayesian updating for a proposed sample size; a pharmacoeconomic model to represent the perspective of a reimbursement authority in which price is contingent on trial outcome; and a model of the pharmaceutical company return on investment linking drug prices to sales revenue. We used a case study of febuxostat versus allopurinol for the treatment of hyperuricemia in patients with gout. Trial design scenarios studied included alternative treatment doses, inclusion criteria, input uncertainty, and sample size. Optimal trial sample sizes varied depending on the uncertainty of model inputs, trial inclusion criteria, and treatment doses. This interdisciplinary framework for trial design and sample size calculation may have value in supporting decisions during later phases of drug development and in identifying costly sources of uncertainty, and thus inform future research and development strategies.",

        "Abstract":"Introduction A systematic review and meta-analysis of the available randomized controlled trials (RCTs) were conducted to investigate the efficacy and safety of dotinurad in hyperuricemic patients with or without gout. Dotinurad is a novel selective urate reabsorption inhibitor (SURI) that increases uric acid excretion by selectively inhibiting urate transporter 1 (URAT1). To the best of our knowledge, this is the first meta-analysis conducted to gauge the efficacy and safety of dotinurad.  Methods Electronic databases (PubMed, the Cochrane Library, and ClinicalTrials.gov) were searched from inception till March 2, 2021, according to the Preferred Reporting Items for Systematic Review and Meta-Analysis statement. Randomized controlled trials comparing the efficacy and safety of dotinurad with placebo- or active (febuxostat or benzbromarone) control were included. The eligible studies were analyzed with RevMan 5.3 Software (The Nordic Cochrane Centre, Cochrane Collaboration, Copenhagen). Results Four eligible studies, consisting of 684 hyperuricemic patients were included. The number of patients who achieved serum uric acid (sUA) levels ≤ 6.0 mg\/dl favoured dotinurad 1 mg group as compared to placebo group (risk ratio {RR} = 39.27, 95% onfidence interval {CI}, 5.59 to 275.65; p = 0.0002), dotinurad 2 mg group compared with placebo group (RR = 45.36, 95% CI, 6.48 to 317.38; p= 0.0001), and dotinurad 4 mg group compared with placebo group (RR = 54.16, 95% CI, 7.76 to 377.77; p < 0.0001). Conversely, there was no significant difference in the number of patients who achieved the target sUA levels between dotinurad 2 mg and active control (RR = 1.00, 95% CI, 0.92 to 1.08; p = 0.91). Moreover, the percentage change in sUA levels from baseline to final visit favoured dotinurad 1 mg vs. placebo ((RR = 36.51, 95% CI, 33.00 to 40.02; p < 0.00001), dotinurad 2 mg vs. placebo (RR = 46.70, 95% CI, 42.53 to 50.87; p < 0.00001), and dotinurad 4 mg vs. placebo (RR = 63.84, 95% CI, 60.51 to 67.16; p < 0.00001), while no significant difference was seen in dotinurad 2 mg vs. active control (RR = -0.08, 95% CI, -4.27 to 4.11; p= 0.97). Compared with active or placebo control, dotinurad 2 mg showed no significant difference in the number of events of gouty arthritis (RR= 1.31, 95% CI, 0.47 to 3.71; p = 0.60), the number patients with adverse events (RR = 1.09, 95% CI, 0.91 to 1.30; p = 0.36), and the number of patients who experienced adverse drug reactions (RR = 1.00, 95% CI, 0.68 to 1.47; p = 0.99). Conclusion Dotinurad shows significant improvement in serum uric acid levels in hyperuricemic individuals with or without gout. Its urate-lowering effect is comparable to the commonly available anti-hyperuricemic agents. Moreover, it is effective at doses 1 mg, 2 mg, and 4 mg and well-tolerated at a dose of 2 mg.",

To better understand this relationship, uricase-deficient Sprague-Dawley rats (Kunming-DY rats) were used. The wild-type rats and Kunming-DY rats were used as controls. Kunming-DY rats were treated with ampicillin (90 mg\/kg) and ciprofloxacin (150 mg\/kg) for 5 days. Bacterial 16S rDNA in the fresh stool was sequenced, and the abundance was calculated. The rats' serum uric acid (SUA) level was assayed, and the rats' intake and output in 24 h were recorded. The bacterial diversity in three groups' fresh stool was analyzed. The gut bacterial diversity and abundance changed in the Kunming-DY rats. More than 99% of bacteria were inhibited or killed by the combination of antibiotics. In contrast to each of the antibiotics alone, the combination of antibiotics lowered the Kunming-DY rats' SUA level; it also caused mild diarrhea, which increased uric acid excretion through stool. These results suggested that the aboriginal gut bacteria in uricase-deficient rats play a minor role in determining the SUA levels. It is too early to conclude that aboriginal gut bacteria are a tempting target for lowering SUA levels.",

        "Abstract":"rd\nSerum uric acid (UA) is taken up by endothelial cells and reduces the level of nitric oxide (NO) by inhibiting its production and accelerating its degradation. Cytosolic and plasma xanthine oxidase (XO) generates superoxide and also decreases the NO level. Thus, hyperuricemia is associated with impaired endothelial function. Hyperuricemia is often associated with vascular diseases such as chronic kidney disease (CKD) and cardiovascular disease (CVD). It has long been debated whether hyperuricemia is causally related to the development of these diseases. The 2020 American College of Rheumatology Guideline for the Management of Gout (ACR2020) does not recommend pharmacological treatment of hyperuricemia in patients with CKD\/CVD. In contrast, the Japanese Guideline on Management of Hyperuricemia and Gout (JGMHG), 3edition, recommends pharmacological treatment of hyperuricemia in patients with CKD. In a FREED study on Japanese hyperuricemic patients with CVD, an XO inhibitor, febuxostat, improved the primary composite endpoint of cerebro-cardio-renovascular events, providing a rationale for the use of urate-lowering agents (ULAs). Since a CARES study on American gout patients with CVD treated with febuxostat revealed increased mortality, ACR2020 recommends switching to different ULAs. However, there was no difference in the mortality of Japanese patients between the febuxostat-treated group and the placebo or allopurinol-treated groups in either the FEATHER or FREED studies.",

        "Abstract":"PURPOSE OF REVIEW: Hyperuricemia is highly prevalent, affecting approximately 38 million individuals in the United States. However, the significance of asymptomatic hyperuricemia - hyperuricemia in the absence of gout - continues to be debated.\nRECENT FINDINGS: Asymptomatic hyperuricemia results in monosodium urate crystal deposition in tissues, which may promote chronic inflammation. Intracellularly, hyperuricemia inhibits the master regulator adenosine monophosphate (AMP)-associated protein kinase and may condition innate immune responses through durable epigenetic modifications. At the population level, asymptomatic hyperuricemia is associated with multiple comorbidities, including hypertension, chronic kidney disease, coronary artery disease, and diabetes; limitations of these studies include that most are retrospective and some do not rigorously distinguish between asymptomatic hyperuricemia and gout. Treatment studies suggest that urate lowering may reduce the risk of incidence or progression of some of these comorbidities; unfortunately, many of these treatment studies are small or flawed, and not all study results are consistent.\nSUMMARY: Accumulating evidence suggests that asymptomatic hyperuricemia contributes to the comorbidities with which it associates and that proper asymptomatic hyperuricemia treatment may reduce future risk. Additional prospective trials are needed to definitely establish causality and support decision-making as to whether, and which patients with asymptomatic hyperuricemia would warrant urate-lowering treatment.",

        "Abstract":"INTRODUCTION The Gout Stop Programme was developed for primary care in Northland, New Zealand, to address inequitable health outcomes for Māori and Pacific people with gout. AIM The aim of the programme was to make it easier for clinicians to prescribe urate-lowering treatment, facilitate patient adherence through education and support, and reduce barriers to gout prevention and long-term management. METHODS From 2015 to 2017, patients with acute gout who met inclusion criteria were prescribed treatment according to a 'Gout Stop Pack' option, based on renal function and diabetes status. Patients were monitored by community pharmacists. Gout educators and a Gout Kaiāwhina (community support worker) provided education and support to patients and whānau (families). Patient completion of the programme and outcomes, according to target serum urate level, were recorded. Patient experience was documented using a questionnaire and rating scale. RESULTS In total, 160 clinicians prescribed therapy at 887 patient presentations; 71% were Māori and Pacific patients. The completion rate was 55% in this group and 84% for the non-Māori and non-Pacific group. In the Māori and Pacific group, 40% reached the target serum urate level (≤0.36 mmol L-1) in 91 days, and 26% required further titration. In the non-Māori\/non-Pacific group, these rates were 51% and 19% respectively. Following programme completion, 68% of Māori and Pacific patients and 65% of non-Māori and non-Pacific patients continued to take allopurinol. The 21 patients interviewed rated the programme as excellent or very good. DISCUSSION Culturally appropriate education and support for patients and the primary care team was essential. Collaboration between prescribers, community pharmacists and support workers reduced barriers to initiating prevention and long-term urate-lowering treatment and urate testing in this high-needs gout population.",

Rhein is a major bioactive metabolite of diacerein which has been approved for treating osteoarthritis with a good safety profile in humans. Gouty arthritis is an inflammatory disease characterized by urate crystal-induced NLRP3 inflammasome activation with up-regulated caspase-1 protease and IL-1  in macrophages. Inhibition of the NLRP3 inflammasome formation has been considered as a potential therapeutic avenue for treating or preventing many inflammatory diseases. This study aimed to evaluate the anti-inflammatory effects of rhein on gouty arthritis. Rhein within the physiological levels of humans showed no toxicity on the cell viability and differentiation, but significantly decreased the production of IL-1  , TNF-  and caspase-1 protease in urate crystal-activated macrophages. Compared to medium controls, rhein at the therapeutic concentration (2.5   g\/mL) effectively inhibited IL-1  production by 47% (  ). Rhein did not affect the mRNA levels of CASP1, NLRP3 and ASC, but suppressed the protein expression and enzyme activity of caspase-1. Immunofluorescence confocal microscopy further revealed that rhein suppressed the aggregation of ASC speck and inhibited the formation of NLRP3 inflammasome. Rhein of 5   g\/mL significantly decreased the ASC speck to 36% (  ), and reduced the NLRP3 aggregates to 37.5% (  ). Our data demonstrate that rhein possesses pharmacological activity to suppress caspase-1 protease activity and IL-1  production by interfering with the formation of NLRP3 multiprotein complex. These results suggest that rhein has therapeutic potential for treating NLRP3 inflammasome-mediated diseases such as gouty arthritis.",

        "Abstract":"The prevalence of hyperuricemia and chronic kidney disease (CKD) has been steadily increasing. The role of hyperuricemia and efficacy of uric acid-lowering agents against CKD progression remain controversial. This study aimed to evaluate the effect of hyperuricemia and uric acid-lowering agents on the progression of CKD. A total 2042 patients with CKD were analyzed in the KoreaN cohort Study for Outcomes in patients With Chronic Kidney Disease (KNOW-CKD), a prospective cohort study. Patients were classified into quartiles on the basis of their serum uric acid level and the prevalence of advanced CKD was higher in patients with a high uric acid level. A composite renal outcome was defined as one or more of the following: initiation of dialysis or transplantation, a two-fold increase in baseline serum creatinine levels, or a 50% decline in the estimated glomerular filtration rate during the follow-up period. A Cox proportional hazard ratio model was applied to analyze the relationship between composite renal outcome and uric acid levels. The risk of progression to renal failure increased by 28% (hazard ratio [HR], 1.277; 95% confidence interval [CI], 1.212-1.345) for each 1 mg\/dl increase in the baseline uric acid level. In multivariate models, an association was found between the highest quartile of uric acid and increased risk of composite renal outcome (HR, 3.590; 95% CI, 2.546-5.063). A propensity score matching analysis was performed to survey the effect of uric acid lowering agent. Both allopurinol and febuxostat did not affect the renal outcome. In conclusion, hyperuricemia appears to be an independent risk factor for composite renal outcome, but allopurinol and febuxostat did not show reno-protective effect.",

According to Japanese hypertension management guidelines published in 2019, a target serum uric acid level of ≤6.0 mg\/dL is recommended in hypertensive patients with gout or asymptomatic hyperuricemia. Dotinurad is a novel uric acid-lowering drug classified as a selective urate reabsorption inhibitor. A pooled analysis was performed on the uric acid-lowering effect of dotinurad in 222 hypertensive patients with gout or asymptomatic hyperuricemia in four clinical trials (NCT02344862, NCT02416167, NCT03100318, NCT03372200). Moreover, we analyzed the long-term uric acid-lowering effect of dotinurad in 154 hypertensive patients with gout or asymptomatic hyperuricemia (NCT03006445).: In the pooled analysis, the percent change in the decrease of serum uric acid with the use of dotinurad was 42.17 ± 12.42% at a dose of 2 mg and 60.42 ± 8.03% at a dose of 4 mg; the percentage of patients who achieved a serum uric acid level of ≤6.0 mg\/dL was 82.8% and 100.0%. The long-term uric acid-lowering effect of dotinurad showed almost the same results. In this study, the concomitant use of diuretics or angiotensin II receptor blockers affected the uric acid-lowering effect of dotinurad at only a dose of 2 mg in the pooled analysis.: In the pooled analysis, dotinurad lowered serum uric acid levels. Dotinurad has an achievement rate of over 80% for serum uric acid level of ≤6.0 mg\/dL in both analyses, and will be clinically useful for the management of hyperuricemic states in hypertensive patients.",

Patients were randomized to receive either placebo (121 patients) or 300 mg\/day allopurinol (124 patients). We have examined uric acid, urinary protein creatinin ratio, MDRD (the modification of diet in renal diseases) and CRP (C-reactive protein) before and 24 weeks after treatment in both group.\nRESULTS: In the allopurinol group, the mean serum uric acid levels, eGFR (estimated glomerular filtration rate), and creatinine urinary albumin creatinin ratio (UACR) significantly improved (p < 0.001). Also uric acid level was positively correlated with the UACR (r = 0,645 p < 0.001) and negatively correlated with MDRD (r = -0,387 p < 0.05) in allopurinol treatment group.

The objective of our study was to assess whether allopurinol use is associated with a reduction in the risk of ventricular arrhythmias (VA).\nMETHODS: We used the 5% random sample of Medicare beneficiaries from 2006-2012 to examine new allopurinol use and the risk of incident VA. Multivariable Cox regression analyses were adjusted for demographics (age, race, sex), comorbidity, cardiac medications, and conditions associated with VA. We calculated hazard ratios (HR) and 95% confidence intervals (CI).\nRESULTS: Of the 28,755 episodes of new allopurinol use, 2538 were associated with incident VA (8.8%). Among patients with incident VA, 54% were male, 78% were White, 75% had gout as the underlying diagnosis, and the mean Charlson-Romano comorbidity score was 4.8. The crude incidence of VA per 1,000,000 person-days declined as the duration of allopurinol use increased: 1-180 days, 151; 181 days to 2 years, 105; and > 2 years, 85. In multivariable-adjusted analyses, compared to non-use, allopurinol use was associated with lower HR of VA of 0.82 (95% CI, 0.76-0.90). Compared to allopurinol non-use, longer allopurinol use durations were significantly associated with lower multivariable-adjusted HR for VA: 1-180 days, 0.96 (95% CI, 0.85-1.08); 181 days to 2 years, 0.76 (95% CI, 0.68-0.85); and > 2 years, 0.72 (95% CI, 0.60-0.87). Multiple sensitivity analyses adjusting for cardiac conditions, anti-arrhythmic drugs and alternate definitions confirmed our findings with minimal\/no attenuation of estimates.\nCONCLUSION: Allopurinol use and use duration of more than 6 months were independently associated with a lower risk of VA.

        "Abstract":"OBJECTIVE: The American College of Rheumatology's (ACR) 2020 guidelines for the management of gout recommend using a treat-to-target approach to lower serum urate (SU). Using the ACR's Rheumatology Informatics System for Effectiveness registry, we examined the use of a treat-to-target approach among gout patients receiving long-term urate-lowering therapy (ULT) and followed longitudinally by rheumatologists.\nMETHODS: Included patients had one or more diagnoses for gout in 2018-2019 and continuous use of ULT for ≥12 months. We assessed the proportions of patients with SU monitoring and, among those tested, who achieved SU <6.0 mg\/dl during the measurement year. Multilevel logistic regression adjusting for sociodemographics, comorbidities, region, and health care utilization was used to determine factors associated with SU monitoring and achievement of target SU.\nRESULTS: A total of 9,560 were included. The mean ± SD age was 67.2 ± 12.7 years, 73.5% of patients were male, and 32.3% were non-White. Fifty-six percent of patients had at least 1 SU recorded during the measurement year; among patients with at least 1 SU recorded, 74% achieved the SU target. In multivariate analyses, non-White patients were slightly less likely to be tested or achieve a target SU.\nCONCLUSION: Among gout patients receiving long-term ULT followed longitudinally by rheumatologists, more than half had a documented SU, and among those tested, three-quarters achieved the recommended SU target. Routine monitoring of SU is a first step toward improving quality of care for patients with gout.",

        "Abstract":"Whether the clinical trial treatment effect of urate-lowering therapy (ULT) in patient with chronic kidney disease (CKD) is generalizable to real-word settings is unclear. This study aimed to compare febuxostat with allopurinol for uric acid reduction and renal protection in patients with CKD. Adult CKD patients newly treated with ULT were identified using electronic health records from 2010 to 2015 from a large healthcare delivery system in Taiwan. Patients with renal replacement therapy or undergoing ULT for <3 months were excluded. Propensity score-matched cohort study design was conducted to compare outcomes between patients initiated with febuxostat or allopurinol therapy. Cox regression analyses were employed to compare the adjusted hazards ratio (aHR) of incident event of estimated glomerular filtration rate (eGFR) ≥ 30% decrease, and the difference in longitudinal changes in serum uric acid (SUA) and eGFR between groups was analyzed using linear mixed model. Overall, 1050 CKD patients who initiated febuxostat (n = 525) or allopurinol (n = 525) treatment were observed for 2.5 years. Compared with allopurinol, febuxostat use was associated with higher rate of patients maintaining SUA target <6 mg\/dL in >80% of follow-up time with a reduction in mean SUA change. There were no significant differences in the mean eGFR changes over time between the febuxostat and allopurinol groups or in the risk of eGFR decline ≥30% of baseline. Febuxostat was associated with greater reduction in SUA level than allopurinol in patients with CKD. However, febuxostat and allopurinol showed no difference in renal function changes during study follow-up. These findings require further investigation with long-term follow up in CKD patients with hyperuricemia.",

        "Abstract":"BACKGROUND: Gout is a painful disorder and is common in type 2 diabetes. Fenofibrate lowers uric acid and reduces gout attacks in small, short-term studies. Whether fenofibrate produces sustained reductions in uric acid and gout attacks is unknown.\nMETHODS: In the Fenofibrate Intervention and Event Lowering in Diabetes (FIELD) trial, participants aged 50-75 years with type 2 diabetes were randomly assigned to receive either co-micronised fenofibrate 200 mg once per day or matching placebo for a median of 5 years follow-up. We did a post-hoc analysis of recorded on-study gout attacks and plasma uric acid concentrations according to treatment allocation. The outcomes of this analysis were change in uric acid concentrations and risk of on-study gout attacks. The FIELD study is registered with ISRCTN, number ISRCTN64783481.\nFINDINGS: Between Feb 23, 1998, and Nov 3, 2000, 9795 patients were randomly assigned to fenofibrate (n=4895) or placebo (n=4900) in the FIELD study. Uric acid concentrations fell by 20·2% (95% CI 19·9-20·5) during the 6-week active fenofibrate run-in period immediately pre-randomisation (a reduction of 0·06 mmol\/L or 1 mg\/dL) and remained -20·1% (18·5-21·7, p<0·0001) lower in patients taking fenofibrate than in those on placebo in a random subset re-measured at 1 year. With placebo allocation, there were 151 (3%) first gout events over 5 years, compared with 81 (2%) among those allocated fenofibrate (HR with treatment 0·54, 95% CI 0·41-0·70; p<0·0001). In the placebo group, the cumulative proportion of patients with first gout events was 7·7% in patients with baseline uric acid concentration higher than 0·36 mmol\/L and 13·9% in those with baseline uric acid concentration higher than 0·42 mmol\/L, compared with 3·4% and 5·7%, respectively, in the fenofibrate group. Risk reductions were similar among men and women and those with dyslipidaemia, on diuretics, and with elevated uric acid concentrations. For participants with elevated baseline uric acid concentrations despite taking allopurinol at study entry, there was no heterogeneity of the treatment effect of fenofibrate on gout risk. Taking account of all gout events, fenofibrate treatment halved the risk (HR 0·48, 95% CI 0·37-0·60; p<0·0001) compared with placebo.\nINTERPRETATION: Fenofibrate lowered uric acid concentrations by 20%, and almost halved first on-study gout events over 5 years of treatment. Fenofibrate could be a useful adjunct for preventing gout in diabetes.\nFUNDING: None.",

        "Abstract":"OBJECTIVE: To investigate the therapeutic effect of allopurinol treatment on acute coronary syndrome and to elucidate its possible mechanism.\nMETHODS: Patients with acute coronary syndrome (n = 100) were recruited as research subjects in our hospital. The patients were randomly divided into two groups, an allopurinol group (n = 50) and a control group (n = 50). These two groups were treated with conventional antiplatelet, anticoagulation and anti-ischemic therapy; allopurinol therapy was added to the allopurinol group based on conventional treatment indications. Biochemical markers such as serum creatinine, uric acid, BNP, blood glucose and blood lipid were compared between the two groups. Indicators of oxidative stress and inflammatory response (MDA, OX-LDL, NO, hs-CRP and TNF-α), as well as cardiovascular events during 2-years follow-up, were recorded.\nRESULTS: On admission, there was no difference in serum creatinine, uric acid, BNP, blood glucose or lipid levels between the two groups (P > 0.05). However, after 1 month of treatment, these levels were improved in patients in the allopurinol group compared to the control group (P < 0.05). MDA, OX-LDL, hs-CRP and TNF-α decreased after treatment periods of 14 days and 1 month. They were also decreased at 3 month, 6 month, 1 year, and 2 year follow-up visits. However, data from the allopurinol group demonstrated significantly lower levels than in the control group (P < 0.05). Additionally, compared with the control group, allopurinol treatment significantly elevated the level of NO (P < 0.05). The total effective rates of the allopurinol group are much higher than in the control group for both angina pectoris (93.2% and 76%, respectively) and ECG (96% and 82%, respectively). Most patients in the allopurinol group (n = 40) and the control group (n = 41) received stent implantation with no significant difference shown between them. The incidence of cardiovascular events during 2 years of follow-up in the allopurinol group was 10%; it was 30% in the control group.\nCONCLUSION: Allopurinol has a remarkable effect in the treatment of ACS and can improve the oxidative stress and inflammatory reaction indicators of patients. The protective mechanism of allopurinol might be achieved by suppressing the secretion and release of inflammatory mediators such as TNF-α, hs-CRP, OX-LDL and MDA while increasing levels of NO.",

Gout attack times were recorded as ≤ 5, 6-10, 11-20, and > 20. Adjusted odds ratio (OR) and corresponding 95% confidence interval (CI) were calculated to explore the association between selected risk factors and frequent gout attacks.\nRESULTS: Six hundred fifty-three gout patients with a mean age of 48.3 ± 15.8 years were included, 84.7% of whom were males. The median gout duration was 6.0 (3.0-12.0) years. The most common comorbidities involved hypertension (166, 25.4%), coronary artery disease (CAD) (67, 10.3%), chronic kidney disease (66, 10.1%), and hyperlipidemia (57, 8.7%). Abnormalities including nephrolithiasis (29.4%), hydronephrosis (3.2%), and gallstones (11.9%) were also found. Although female patients had a longer disease duration and more CAD, they had a lower level of UA, creatine, and C-reactive protein (CRP) but higher high-density lipoprotein cholesterol (HDL-C) (p < 0.05). A positive correlation between UA and triglycerides was found in females (p = 0.039). Patients with renal insufficiency or nephrolithiasis had longer disease duration and more gout attacks (p < 0.001). In multivariable regression analysis, only gout duration (OR = 7.89, p < 0.001) and UA (OR = 1.48, p < 0.001) was independent factors of frequent gout attacks.\nCONCLUSIONS: Comorbidity screening involving dyslipidemia is often neglected in gout patients. Gout duration and UA are the risk factors of frequent gout attacks. Key Points • Comorbidities can be overlooked if the screening for lipid levels, cardiovascular disease, and kidney disease is not completed. • There are differences in comorbidities and biochemical findings between male and female patients with gout. • Gout duration and serum uric acid level are independent risk factors of frequent gout attacks.",

Accumulating evidence has demonstrated the efficacy of topiroxostat for the treatment of hyperuricemia with or without gout. However, the safety and efficacy of topiroxostat in the clinical setting remain unclear, and there is little large-scale clinical evidence. We conducted a post-marketing observational study over 54 weeks.\nPATIENTS AND METHODS: Patients were centrally enrolled, and case report forms of 4491 patients were collected between April 2014 and March 2019 from 825 medical sites.\nRESULTS: Overall, 4329 patients were assessed for safety and 4253 patients for effectiveness. The overall incidence of adverse drug reactions was 6.95%, and the incidence rates of adverse drug reactions of gouty arthritis, hepatic dysfunction, and skin disorders, which are of special interest in this study, were 0.79%, 1.73%, and 0.95%, respectively. No case of serious gouty arthritis was observed. Serum urate levels decreased stably over time and showed a significant reduction rate at 54 weeks (21.19% ± 22.07%) and on the final visit (19.91% ± 23.35%) compared to the baseline.

It can profoundly decrease serum urate to < 1 mg\/dl. In patients receiving pegloticase who did not generate high-titer antidrug antibodies (responders), the serum urate remained low for the duration of therapy, 6 months in the phase III clinical trials plus the open-label extension. The objective of this study was to assess the velocity of tophus resolution in subjects treated with pegloticase.\nMETHODS: Data from two randomized controlled trials of pegloticase in chronic refractory gout were analyzed. Tophi were assessed by computer-assisted measurements of standardized digital photographs. Subjects were designated as responders and nonresponders based on maintenance of serum urate < 6 mg\/dl at months 3 and 6 of treatment. The projected time of complete resolution of all tophi was determined by linear regression analysis.\nRESULTS: The mean total tophus area at baseline was 585.8 mm for responders, 661.5 mm for nonresponders, and 674.4 mm for placebo-treated patients. Complete resolution at 6 months of at least one tophus was achieved by 69.6% of 23 responders, 27.9% of 43 nonresponders, and 14.3% of 21 patients who received placebo. Complete resolution of all photographed tophi was achieved by 34.8% of biochemical responders, 11.6% of nonresponders, and 0% of placebo-treated patients. The mean velocity of resolution of all tophi was 60.1 mm\/month in responders with a mean projected time of complete resolution of 9.9 months (4.6-32.6 months). There was a significant inverse correlation between serum urate AUC and tophus resolution velocity (r = - 0.40, P = 0.0002), although considerable heterogeneity in the velocity of resolution was noted. The only patient characteristic that correlated with the velocity of tophus resolution was the baseline tophus area.\nCONCLUSIONS: Pegloticase treatment caused a rapid resolution of tophi in responders that correlated with the serum urate lowering associated with this therapy.",

We aimed to evaluate the predictive performance of a pharmacokinetic-pharmacodynamic (PK-PD) model of the hypouricaemic effects of febuxostat.\nMETHODS: Previously, we formulated a PK-PD model for predicting the hypouricaemic effects of febuxostat as a function of baseline serum urate levels, body weight, renal function and drug dose, using datasets reported in preapproval studies. Using an updated model with a sensitivity analysis, we examined the predictive performance of the PK-PD model, using datasets obtained from the medical records of patients who received febuxostat from March 2011 to December 2015 at Tokyo Women's Medical University Hospital. Multivariate regression analysis was performed to explore clinical variables to improve the predictive performance of the model.\nRESULTS: A total of 1199 serum urate values were retrieved from 168 patients (age: 60.5 ± 17.7 years; 71.4% male) who were receiving febuxostat as a treatment for hyperuricaemia. There was a significant correlation (r = 0.68; P < 0.01) between the serum urate levels observed and those predicted by the modified PK-PD model. A multivariate regression analysis revealed that the predictive performance of the model could be improved further by considering comorbidities (such as diabetes mellitus), estimated glomerular filtration rate (eGFR) and the coadministration of loop diuretics (r = 0.77, P < 0.01).\nCONCLUSIONS: The PK-PD model may be useful for predicting individualized maintenance doses of febuxostat in real-world patients.",

The primary endpoint was the proportion of patients with sUA <6.0 mg\/dl at month 6. Safety assessments included treatment-emergent adverse events (TEAEs) and laboratory data. Patients who completed the study were eligible for an open-label, uncontrolled extension study of lesinurad 400 mg monotherapy.\nRESULTS: Patients (n = 214) were primarily white males (mean age 54.4 years; gout duration 11.2 years). Significantly more patients achieved the primary endpoint with lesinurad than placebo (29.9 vs 1.9%; P < 0.0001). Overall TEAE rates were higher with lesinurad (77.6 vs 65.4%); renal-related TEAEs (17.8%), renal-related serious TEAEs (4.7%) and serum creatinine elevations (1.5 times baseline, 24.3%) occurred only with lesinurad. A total of 143 patients (65 lesinurad, 78 placebo) enrolled in the extension study.

        "Abstract":"a\nCo-crystallization studies were undertaken to improve the solubility of a highly water-insoluble drug febuxostat (FXT), used in the treatment of gout and hyperuricemia. The selection of co-crystal former (CCF) molecules such as 1-hydroxy 2-naphthoic acid (1H-2NPH), 4-hydroxy benzoic acid (4-HBA), salicylic acid (SAC), 5-nitro isophthalic acid (5-NPH), isonicotinamide (ISNCT), and picolinamide (PICO) was based on the presence of complementary functional groups capable of forming hydrogen bond and the ΔpK difference between FXT and CCF. A liquid-assisted grinding (LAG) method was successfully employed for the rapid screening of various pharmaceutical adducts. These adducts were characterized based on their unique thermal (differential scanning calorimetry) and spectroscopic (Fourier transform infrared and Raman spectroscopy) profiles. Binary phase diagrams (BPD) were plotted to establish a relationship between the thermal events and adduct formed. Powder X-ray diffraction (PXRD) studies were carried out to confirm the formation of eutectic\/co-crystal. Thermogravimetric analysis (TGA) was also performed for the novel co-crystals obtained. The propensity for strong homo-synthons over weak hetero-synthons and strong hetero-synthons over weak homo-synthons during supramolecular growth resulted in the formation of eutectics and co-crystals respectively. FXT:1H-2NPH (1), FXT:4-HBA (1), FXT:SAC (1, 2), and FXT:5-NPH (2-1) gave rise to pure eutectic systems, while FXT:ISNCT (2-1) and FXT:PICO (1) gave rise to novel co-crystals with characteristic DSC heating curves and PXRD pattern. Additionally, the impact of microenvironmental pH and microspeciation profile on the improved dissolution profile of the co-crystals was discussed. Graphical Abstract.",

        "Published":"2020-07-13",
        "Abstract":"Gout is the most common form of inflammatory arthritis in men, yet both patients and the public often do not recognise gout as a form of arthritis. Instead, due to historical misconceptions, gout is typically seen as a lifestyle disease caused by poor diet. In reality, there are a number of risk factors that contribute to gout, including genetic factors. Views of gout as precipitated by lifestyle alone can lead to stigma, and maladaptive beliefs that it should be treated primarily through dietary changes. This is thought to contribute to poor uptake of, and adherence to, effective pharmaceutical treatments. Gout has some of the poorest medication adherence rates of any chronic disease, contributing to suboptimal health outcomes for patients. Recent research suggests that when gout is referred to as 'urate crystal arthritis' (a rarely used name for gout), the perception of the disease by members of the public was more accurate. It was viewed as being less under personal control (i.e. less appropriately managed by behaviours such as dietary intake), and more appropriately managed by long-term medical treatment. This finding raises the possibility that patients themselves might also benefit from gout being explicitly labelled as arthritis. Indeed, parallels can be drawn between this case and other diseases that have recently had their names changed to improve outcomes, namely primary biliary cirrhosis and schizophrenia. A movement away from the term gout may benefit those living with the disease by changing illness perceptions and increasing uptake of, and adherence to, guideline-recommended treatment(s).",

        "Abstract":"INTRODUCTION: The aim of postoperative examination, treatment and follow-up of patients with urinary stone disease is a prevention of recurrence. A choice of method of prevention is based on the results of postoperative examination with consideration of etiological factors of urinary stone disease. An analysis of influence of osteoporosis and its causative factors on the recurrence of urinary stone disease is presented in the article.\nAIM: to clarify the influence of osteoporosis and its causative factors on excretion of calcium, uric acid and recurrence of urinary stone disease.\nMATERIALS AND METHODS: A total of 86 patients after surgical treatment of urinary stone disease were included in the study. A physicochemical analysis of stones and their fragments, excretion of calcium and uric acid were done postoperatively. The risk factors for osteoporosis were identified using specific questionnaire. Bone mineral density (BMD) was assessed by X-ray densitometry. After X-ray phasic analysis of the stones and studying of the daily excretion of calcium and uric acid, 10 and 7 patients were prescribed to thiazide diuretics and allopurinol, respectively. In 69 patients (80.2%) there were no indications to the treatment and all of them were included in control surveillance group.\nRESULTS: Calcium oxalate stones were predominated in patients who were under surveillance (=0,0254). A prevalence of risk factors for osteoporosis was similar in all groups (=0,2156), as well as rate of decrease in BMD (=0,64). In patients taking thiazide diuretics, a significant decrease in daily calcium excretion was found (=0,0054) without significant changes in excretion of uric acid and diuresis volume. Among patients receiving allopurinol there was a significant decrease in daily uric acid excretion (=0,021), without significant changes in excretion of calcium and diuresis volume. There were no significant changes of these values in the control group. A recurrence of urinary stone disease in treatment group was detected in 4 patients with a decrease of BMD after 381+\/-61 days, while in control group there were 5 recurrences in patients with decreased BMD and I recurrence in patient with normal BMD after 836+\/-64 days.\nCONCLUSION: Treatment aimed at prevention of recurrence of urinary stone disease allows to correct detected metabolic disturbances. However, such factor as the decrease in BMD can influence on the rate and frequency of recurrence of urinary stone disease. A clarifying of risk factors for osteoporosis and diagnosis of osteoporosis allow to give reliable recommendations for its treatment and to decrease risk of recurrence of urinary stone disease.",

Of 129 MOs, 42 responded. The overall response was 32.6%. On analysis, 65.1% felt their knowledge of gout to be adequate and 61.6% thought they had been educated well. In acute assessment, 59.1% of GPs responded that the diagnosis of gout best be confirmed with a joint aspiration and 36.4% clinical suspicion. Differing, 85.7% of MOs chose a joint aspiration. In acute management, if colchicine were used, 59.1% of GPs would give 1 mg followed by 0.5 mg an hour later, then 0.5 mg twice daily, compared to 9.5% of MOs, while 20.5% of GPs would use 1 mg twice daily. Chronic management was answered poorly. After an acute attack, urate lowering therapy (ULT) would be started 14 days after by 47.7% of GPs, compared to 69.0% of MOs.

Overweight\/obese individuals are more prone to endothelial dysfunction than their lean counterparts. However, the effect of lowering serum uric acid on endothelial dysfunction in these individuals has not been examined thoroughly. In this randomized, double-blind, placebo-controlled trial of nonhypertensive, overweight, or obese individuals with higher serum uric acid (body mass index ≥25 kg\/m and serum uric acid ≥5.0 mg\/dL), we assigned subjects to probenecid (500-1000 mg\/d), allopurinol (300-600 mg\/d), or matching placebo.

Since asymptomatic increased serum urate levels are associated with a higher risk of cardiovascular, renal and metabolic disorders, a larger use of ULTs in the general population is expected in the near future.\nAREAS COVERED: This review will focus on the safety and tolerability profile of the available urate-lowering drugs: xanthine oxidase inhibitors (XOIs), uricosuric agents and injectable uricases.\nEXPERT OPINION: Older drugs for ULT like allopurinol are well studied and extensively described from typical adverse effects (mild skin rash) to unusual fatal reactions, while febuxostat seems to be overall well tolerated. More evidence is required to define the safety profile of topiroxostat, arhalofenate, tranilast, and sulfinpyrazone. Furthermore, there are some unanswered questions about the pharmacological interactions of probenecid and the hepatotoxicity of benzbromarone. Despite a limited use in clinical practice, combination therapy with lesinurad or verinurad and XOI is not frequently accompanied by side effects. Rasburicase and pegloticase are usually well tolerated with some specific exceptions. Before prescribing UL drugs, physicians should take into account their safety profile tailoring the treatment on the patient characteristics.",

This study is aimed at exploring the clinical effectiveness of TCM called the Guizhi Shaoyao Zhimu Decoction in the treatment of hyperuricemia. A total of 100 patients with hyperuricemia at the Medical College of the Second Clinical College, Shandong, China, from January 2019 to January 2022 are selected as the research subjects and divided into group A and group B according to the random table method, with 50 cases in each group. Group A is treated with oral allopurinol tablets, 100 mg, 2 times a day, and group B is treated with the modified Guizhi Shaoyao Zhimu Decoction based on group A. For observation, serum uric acid (SUA) levels, urinary uric acid (UUA) levels, levels of serum inflammatory response factors (IL-6, CRP, and TNF-), vascular endothelial function indexes (serum malondialdehyde (MDA) content, nitric oxide (NO) content), an acute attack of gout, and the incidence of adverse reactions are measured. Results show that after 2 w and 4 w of treatment, the levels of blood uric acid in each group gradually decreased compared with those before treatment, and group B is lower than group A ( < 0.05). After treatment, the vascular endothelial function indexes and inflammatory factor levels in each group are significantly improved compared with those before treatment, and the indexes in group B are better than those in group A. There is no significant difference in the incidence of related adverse reactions and acute attack of gout ( > 0.05).

        "Abstract":"Recently, the US Food and Drug Administration (FDA) issued a public safety alert, responding to the results of the now-published Cardiovascular Safety of Febuxostat and Allopurinol in Patients With Gout and Cardiovascular Morbidities (CARES) trial. The CARES trial showed no significant difference between allopurinol and febuxostat in the primary composite end point of cardiovascular (CV) events in subjects with gout and established CV comorbidities at baseline. However, there was a significantly increased risk of CV and all-cause mortality with febuxostat. Urate-lowering therapy (ULT) is central to the long-term management of gout, and xanthine oxidoreductase inhibitor (XOI) therapy is the consensus first-line approach. Allopurinol is generally the first XOI used, but febuxostat is an effective XOI option, and is commonly used when allopurinol is not tolerated. These data are further relevant since CV comorbidities are common in gout. Here, we examine why the CARES trial was done, and discuss other, ongoing comparative studies of febuxostat and allopurinol whose results are awaited. We assess the strengths and limitations of the CARES trial, and appraise the robustness and biologic plausibility of the results. The CARES trial does not prove that febuxostat raises CV mortality risk, but suggests greater risk with febuxostat than allopurinol. The CARES trial results do not support first-line use of febuxostat ULT, and raise questions about febuxostat placement at various pharmacologic ULT decision tree branches. Alternatives to febuxostat that are frequently effective include allopurinol dose escalation and uricosuric therapy alone or combined with allopurinol. The FDA safety alert highlights the need for shared ULT medical decision-making with gout patients, including discussion of the CV safety of febuxostat.",

Demethylation dominated in the degradation of N-7-methylated MXs (such as 7-methylxanthine, theobromine, and caffeine), where C-8 oxidation was the major pathway in the catabolism of 1-methylxanthine, whereas demethylation and C-8 oxidation are likely both involved in the degradation of theophylline. Enzymes responsible for MX degradation were located inside the cell. Both cell culture and cell-free enzyme assays revealed that N-1 demethylation might be a rate-limiting step for the catabolism of the MXs. Surprisingly, accumulation of uric acid was observed in a cell-free reaction system, which might be attributed to the lack of activity of uricase, a cytochrome -coupled membrane integral enzyme.",

The primary endpoint was the change in albuminuria indicated by urine albumin-to-creatinine ratio (UACR) from the baseline at the final time point.\nRESULTS: A total of 80 patients underwent randomization. The changes in UACR after 24 weeks of treatment (or at the final time point if patients failed to reach 24 weeks) relative to the baseline were -122 mg\/gCr (95% CI: -5.1 to -240.1, P = 0.041) in patients treated with high dose, while treatment with low dose topiroxostat could not show significant reduction (P = 0.067). In the linear mixed model including baseline albuminuria, eGFR, age, and sex as covariates, the decreases in UACR were still significant from baseline to 12 weeks by 228.7 ± 83.2 mg\/gCr (P = 0.0075) in the high dose group. The adverse-event profile during this study was not different between the groups.\nCONCLUSION: Topiroxostat 160 mg daily reduced albuminuria in patients with diabetic nephropathy.

In addition to traditional treatments for gout, novel therapies have been introduced in recent years. Indeed, new recommendations for the management of gout have been proposed by various international societies. Although effective and safe medications to treat gout have been available, management of the disease has continued to be suboptimal, with poor patient adherence to ULT and failure to reach serum urate target.

        "Published":null,
        "Abstract":"Lesch-Nyhan disease (LND) is a rare X-linked genetic disorder, with complete hypoxanthine-guanine phosphoribosyltransferase (HGPRT) deficiency, uric acid (UA), hypoxanthine and xanthine accumulation, and a devastating neurologic syndrome. UA excess, causing renal failure, is commonly decreased by xanthine oxidoreductase (XOR) inhibitors, such as allopurinol, yielding a xanthine and hypoxanthine increase. Xanthine accumulation may result in renal stones, while hypoxanthine excess seems involved in the neurological disorder. Inhibition of purine nucleoside phosphorylase (PNP) represents a different strategy for lowering urate. PNP catalyzes the cleavage of purine ribo- and d-ribo-nucleosides into ribose\/deoxyribose phosphate and free bases, starting catabolism to uric acid. Clinical trials demonstrated that PNP inhibitors, initially developed as anticancer drugs, lowered UA in some gouty patients, in association or not with allopurinol. The present study tested the reliability of an analogue of immucillin-G (C1a), a PNP inhibitor, as a therapy for urate, hypoxanthine, and xanthine excess in LND patients by blocking hypoxanthine production upstream. The therapeutic aim is to limit the administration of XOR inhibitors to LND patients by supplying the PNP inhibitor in low doses, avoiding d-nucleoside toxicity. We report studies conducted in primary cultures of skin fibroblasts from controls and LND patients grown in the presence of the PNP inhibitor. Cell viability, oxypurine release in culture medium, and endocellular nucleotide pattern have been monitored in different growth conditions (inhibitor concentration, time, added inosine). Our results demonstrate effective PNP inhibition by low inhibitor concentration, with reduced hypoxanthine release, and no appreciable toxicity in control or patient cells, suggesting a new therapeutic strategy for LND hyperuricemia.",

We used the search terms \"gout\", \"hyperuricaemia\" and \"guideline\". After two rounds of screening, we included the eligible CPGs of gout according to the pre-defined inclusion and exclusion criteria. Methodological quality of included guidelines was assessed with the AGREE-II instrument. The general characteristics of included guidelines and the recommendations were extracted, and the consistency of recommendations across guidelines was compared and analysed.\nRESULTS: A total of 15 gout guidelines including 359 recommendations were retrieved. The main topics covered by the recommendations were diagnosis, pharmacologic treatment of gout flares, pharmacologic urate-lowering therapy (ULT) of chronic gouty arthritis, lifestyle interventions, prophylaxis, and management of asymptomatic hyperuricaemia. The results of AGREE-II appraisal showed that only two guidelines achieved high scores (≥50%) in all six domains. There was substantial discrepancy between the guidelines in recommendations covering the value of computed tomography (CT) and x-rays for diagnosis, the use of corticosteroids as a first-line treatment for flare, the use of colchicine, indications for ULT, the use of febuxostat as first-line ULT, the administration of allopurinol, and the timing of ULT initiation.\nCONLUSIONS: A number of countries are devoting themselves to the development of gout guidelines, but the process of updating guidelines is slower than that suggested by the WHO. Methodological quality is not satisfactory in most guidelines, and recommendations between guidelines are not consistent.",

Prevalence, characteristics, and outcomes of gout flare were described. Factors associated with gout flare were explored using least absolute shrinkage and selection operator selection and multivariate logistic regression. The association between gout flare and hospital length of stay was explored using multivariate linear regression.\nRESULTS: Among 8697 patients hospitalized for COVID-19, 146 patients with comorbid gout were identified and gout flare occurred in 26 (18%). Compared to those without flare, patients with gout flare had higher baseline serum urate and lower prevalence of use of urate-lowering therapy (ULT) and gout flare prophylaxis medications. One-third of gout flare episodes were treated with ≥ 2 antiinflammatory medications. Logistic regression identified GOUT-36 rule ≥ 2, a predictive index for inpatient gout flare, as the only factor associated with gout flare (odds ratio 5.46, 95% CI 1.18-25.37).

Hyperuricemia is a metabolic disorder characterized by a high uric acid level in serum due to an imbalance between uric acid production and excretion and causes gout. Recently, the prevalence of hyperuricemia worldwide has been continuously increasing. Xanthine oxidase (XOD) inhibitors (allopurinol (ALP) and febuxostat) and uricosuric agents (benzbromarone and probenecid) are used to treat hyperuricemia clinically. However, because these drugs are poorly tolerated and cause side effects, such as kidney diseases, hepatotoxicity, gastrointestinal symptoms, and hypersensitivity syndrome, only a limited number of drugs are available. We investigated the antihyperuricemic effects of  leaf ethanol extract (DMLE) and its underlying mechanisms of action through  and  studies. We evaluated uric acid levels in serum and urine, and xanthine oxidase (XOD) inhibition activity in the serum and liver tissue of a hyperuricemic rat model of potassium oxonate (PO)-induced hyperuricemic rats. In vitro study, XOD-inhibitory activity was the lowest among the test substances at the IC50 of ALP. However, the IC50 of DMLE-70 was significantly low compared with that of other DMLEs ( < 0.05). In PO-induced hyperuricemic rats, uric acid (UA) levels in serum and urine were significantly reduced in all DMLE-70 and allopurinol-treated (ALT) groups than in the PC group ( < 0.05). UA levels in urine were lower than those in serum in all DME groups. In PO-induced hyperuricemic rats, DMEE-200 reduced UA concentration in serum and increased UA excretion in the urine. These findings suggest that DMLE exerts antihyperuricemic and uricosuric effects on promoting UA excretion by enhanced secretion and inhibition of UA reabsorption in the kidneys. Thus, DMLE may be a potential treatment for hyperuricemia and gout.",

The patients were categorized according to prescription of allopurinol or febuxostat. Demographic data, comorbidities, concomitant medications, gout-related clinical parameters, and the laboratory results were collected. The serial serum urate (sUA) levels were recorded at the beginning of the treatment (baseline), and after treatment at 12 weeks, 18 weeks, and 27 weeks. The primary efficacy endpoint was the achievement of target urate of < 6 mg\/dl in people taking febuxostat, compared with those taking allopurinol. The secondary endpoints were the predictive factors of achieving target urate level and adverse drug reactions in patients taking febuxostat. Multivariable regression analysis was used to determine factors associated with achieving target serum urate.\nRESULTS: After the treatment, the febuxostat groups had significantly lower mean sUA compared with the allopurinol groups across all follow-up periods. The proportion of people who achieved target serum urate was also higher in the febuxostat groups compared with the allopurinol groups throughout the follow-up periods. The multivariable regression analysis showed that febuxostat 40 mg (OR = 10.96 (95% CI 4.32-27.80); p value < 0.001), febuxostat 80 mg (OR = 9.54 (95% CI 3.91-23.28), smoking (OR = 2.35 (95% CI 1.13-4.91); p value = 0.023), and low baseline serum urate (OR = 0.62 (95% CI 0.52-0.74); p value < 0.001) were associated with the achievement of target serum urate. No adverse drug reaction from febuxostat was observed even among people with renal insufficiency.\nCONCLUSION: In a Thai cohort, people receiving febuxostat are more likely to achieve target serum urate level, compared with people receiving allopurinol. Febuxostat (40 or 80 mg), smoking, and low baseline serum urate were associated with the achievement of target serum urate.\nKEY POINTS: • Febuxostat showed superior urate-lowering efficacy compared with allopurinol in an Asian population. • In addition to febuxostat, lower baseline serum urate level and history of smoking were associated with achieving target serum urate in gout patients.",

We attempted to examine the uric acid-lowering effect and the renoprotective effect of topiroxostat, a selective xanthine oxidoreductase inhibitor, in patients with diabetic nephropathy and hyperuricemia in this pilot study.\nMETHODS: The study design was randomized, double-blind, placebo-controlled, parallel-group study. A total of 65 patients with hyperuricemia and diabetic nephropathy with microalbuminuria were enrolled and assigned to either the topiroxostat group or the placebo group. Topiroxostat (stepwise dosing from 40 to 160 mg\/day) or matching placebo was administered BID for 28 weeks. The primary endpoint was a change in the urinary albumin-to-creatinine ratio in the first-morning-void urine sample. Secondary endpoints were changes in the estimated glomerular filtration rate and the serum uric acid level.\nRESULTS: At 28 weeks, there was no significant difference in the percent change from baseline in the urinary albumin-to-creatinine ratio between the two groups (topiroxostat: 0 vs. placebo: 17%, p = 0.3206), but the changes in the estimated glomerular filtration rate (- 0.2 vs. - 4.0 mL\/min\/1.73 m, p = 0.0303) and the serum uric acid level (- 2.94 vs. - 0.20 mg\/dL, p < 0.0001) were significantly different between the topiroxostat and placebo groups. Gouty arthritis occurred in 1 patient in the placebo group and no patients in the topiroxostat group.\nCONCLUSION: These findings support that diabetic nephropathy combined with hyperuricemia may be associated with kidney dysfunctions.

Different molecular weights of chitosan were used for fabricating ANP formulation by adopting modified ionotropic gelation method. The prepared batches were than evaluated for particle size analysis, entrapment efficiency, transmission electron microscopy, X-ray diffraction, Differential Scanning Calorimetry, in vitro release and in vivo animal study. The in vivo study depicted that post 2 h of administration of different formulations and pure drug; ANPs prepared from low molecular weight chitosan showed maximum concentration of AO in kidney signifying successful kidney targeting of drug (25.92 fold) whereas no or very less amount of AO was seen in other animal groups. Effectiveness (p < 0.01) of formulation in management of hyperuricemia-associated nephrolithiasis was also evaluated via estimation of urine pH and serum and urine uric acid levels of mice. Further histological study was also performed on kidney samples which again affirmed these results. Present investigation demonstrated that ANPs prepared from low MW chitosan depicted maximum kidney-targeting ability that might be due to its specific uptake by the kidneys as well as its higher solubility than other two polymers, which results in enhanced release rate from the formulation and also offers an efficient strategy for the management of hyperuricemic nephrolithiasis.",

Furthermore, dotinurad 4 mg once daily was more effective at achieving urate-lowering targets (RR of dotinurad 4 mg once daily vs. probenecid: 1.68, 95% CI [1.13; 2.50]) and safer (RR of probenecid vs. dotinurad 4 mg once daily: 1.77, 95% CI [0.69; 4.56]) than probenecid.\nCONCLUSIONS: This network meta-analysis demonstrated an important absolute benefit of dotinurad 4 mg once daily to achieve target serum uric acid and low risk of adverse events for drug treatment of gout or hyperuricemia patients. Additionally, verinurad might be used as an alternative uricosuric therapeutic option to dotinurad. These findings provided further comprehensive insight into the treatment value of current uricosuric agents for gout or hyperuricemia. Key Points 1. This is the first systematic review and network meta-analysis examining the efficacy and safety of currently available uricosuric agents in gout or hyperuricemia patients. 2. Recommended doses of dotinurad 4mg once daily used for the treatment of gout or hyperuricemia patients can significantly decrease serum uric acid levels. 3. The present findings will provide further comprehensive insight into the treatment value of certain uricosuric agents for gout or hyperuricemia.",

        "Abstract":"['-1', '-1', '-1', '-1', '-1', '-5', '-1', '-1']\nMany patients fail to achieve the recommended serum urate (SU) target (<6 mgdl) with allopurinol. The aim of our study was to examine the association of ABCG2 with SU target in response to standard doses of allopurinol using a cohort with confirmed adherence. Good response was defined as SU<6 mgdl on allopurinol ⩽300 mgd and poor response as SU⩾6 mgdl despite allopurinol >300 mgd. Adherence was confirmed by oxypurinol concentrations. ABCG2 genotyping was performed using pre-designed single nucleotide polymorphism (SNP) TaqMan assays. Of 264 patients, 120 were good responders, 68 were poor responders and 76 were either non-adherent or could not be classified. The minor allele of ABCG2 SNP rs2231142 conferred a significantly increased risk of poor response to allopurinol (odds ratio=2.71 (1.70-4.48), P=6.0 × 10). This association remained significant after adjustment for age, sex, body mass index, ethnicity, estimated glomerular filtration rate, diuretic use and SU off urate-lowering therapy.

        "Abstract":"BACKGROUND: The benefits of xanthine oxidase inhibitors to chronic heart failure (CHF) patients is controversial. We investigated the beneficial effects of a novel xanthine oxidoreductase inhibitor, topiroxostat, in patients with CHF and hyperuricemia (HU), in comparison to allopurinol.\nMETHODS AND RESULTS: The prospective, randomized open-label, blinded-end-point study was performed in 141 patients with CHF and HU at 4 centers. Patients were randomly assigned to either topiroxostat or allopurinol group to achieve target uric acid level ≤6.0 mg\/dL. According to the protocol, 140 patients were followed up for 24 weeks. Percent change in ln (N-terminal-proB-type natriuretic peptide) at week 24 (primary endpoint) was comparable between topiroxostat and allopurinol groups (1.6±8.2 versus -0.4±8.0%; P = 0.17). In the limited number of patients with heart failure with reduced ejection fraction (HFrEF) (left ventricle ejection fraction <45%), ratio of peak early diastolic flow velocity at mitral valve leaflet to early diastolic mitral annular motion velocity (E\/e') decreased in topiroxostat group, but not in allopurinol group. Urinary 8-hydroxy-2'-deoxyguanosine and L-type fatty acid-binding protein levels increased and osmolality decreased significantly in allopurinol group, while these changes were less or absent in topiroxostat group. In allopurinol group HFrEF patients, additional to the increases in these urinary marker levels, urinary creatinine levels decreased, with no change in clearance, but not in topiroxostat group.\nCONCLUSIONS: Compared with allopurinol, topiroxostat did not show great benefits in patients with CHF and HU. However, topiroxostat might have potential advantages of reducing left ventricular end-diastolic pressure, not worsening oxidative stress in proximal renal tubule, and renoprotection over allopurinol in HFrEF patients.",

        "Abstract":"OBJECTIVE: To synthesize evidence of the effect of contextual factors (CFs) on efficacy of urate-lowering therapy (ULT) on serum urate (SU) as outcome in gout patients.\nMETHODS: Randomised controlled trials (RCTs) from (updated) Cochrane reviews were the starting point. RCTs were included if they explored the role of any CF on efficacy of ULT on SU in gout patients. For CFs with sufficient data (i.e. ≥3 trials), a mixed-effects meta-regression analysis was performed with trial and comparison as random effects, whereas specific CFs were modelled as fixed factors.\nRESULTS: Eight RCTs were included. Effect modification by CFs was explored for age, sex, race, renal function, cardiovascular comorbidity, tophi, thiazide-diuretic use, and previous ULT use. Crude data stratified by renal function were available for four trials (36 randomised comparisons), and suitable for meta-analysis. Pooled estimates revealed that gout patients with a normal, mildly-, or moderately impaired renal function were consistently more likely to achieve SU target with ULT compared to control. Among RCTs comparing ULT to placebo (30 comparisons), effects of ULT on achieving SU target were not statistically different for those with normal (OR:66.87;[11.39-392.75]) compared to mildly (OR:28.54;[5.11-159.46]) and moderately (OR:21.45;[3.20-143.64]) impaired renal function, but seemed lower in those with severely impaired (OR:9.13;[0.96-86.97]) renal function. Data were insufficient to draw conclusions on effect modification by other CFs.\nCONCLUSION: Few RCTs report stratified analyses exploring the role of CFs. ULT seemed effective in reaching the SU target in all levels of renal function, though severely impaired renal function appeared to render a slight disadvantage.",

        "Abstract":"Among mammals, there is a positive correlation between serum uric acid (UA) levels and life span. Humans have high levels of UA because they lack a functional urate oxidase (UOX) enzyme that is present in shorter lived mammals. Here, we show that male and female mice with UOX haploinsufficiency exhibit an age-related elevation of UA levels, and that the life span of female but not male UOX+\/- mice is significantly increased compared to wild-type mice. Serum UA levels are elevated in response to treadmill exercise in UOX+\/- mice, but not wild-type mice, and the endurance of the UOX+\/- mice is significantly greater than wild-type mice. UOX+\/- mice exhibit elevated levels of brain-derived neurotrophic factor, reduced brain damage and improved functional outcome in a model of focal ischemic stroke. Levels of oxidative protein nitration and lipid peroxidation are reduced in muscle and brain tissues of UOX+\/- mice under conditions of metabolic and oxidative stress (running in the case of muscle and ischemia in the case of the brain), consistent with prior evidence that UA can scavenge peroxynitrite and hydroxyl radical. Our findings reveal roles for UA in life span determination, endurance and adaptive responses to brain injury, and suggest novel approaches for protecting cells against injury and for optimizing physical performance.",

We aim to evaluate the effectiveness of use of a personal, self-management, 'smartphone' application (app) to achieve target serum urate concentrations in people with gout. We hypothesise that personalised feedback of serum urate concentrations will improve adherence to ULT.\nMETHODS AND ANALYSIS: Setting and designPrimary care. A prospective, cluster randomised (by general practitioner (GP) practices), controlled trial.\nPARTICIPANTS: GP practices will be randomised to either intervention or control clusters with their patients allocated to the same cluster.\nINTERVENTION: The intervention group will have access to the Healthy.me app tailored for the self-management of gout. The control group patients will have access to the same app modified to remove all functions except the Gout Attack Diary.\nPRIMARY AND SECONDARY OUTCOMES: The proportion of patients whose serum urate concentrations are less than or equal to 0.36 mmol\/L after 6 months. Secondary outcomes will be proportions of patients achieving target urate concentrations at 12 months, ULT adherence rates, serum urate concentrations at 6 and 12 months, rates of attacks of gout, quality of life estimations and process and economic evaluations.

        "Abstract":"BACKGROUND: Benzbromarone is a potent uricosuric but is not widely available due to concerns about hepatotoxicity. In Aotearoa New Zealand, benzbromarone has been available since April 2013, subject to funding restrictions, for patients with inadequate urate-lowering response or intolerance to allopurinol and probenecid.\nAIM: To assess the safety and efficacy of benzbromarone in a real-life setting.\nMETHODS: All patients who received funding for benzbromarone from 1 April 2013 to 30 September 2014 were identified. Prescribers were sent a questionnaire for each individual. Information on demographics, efficacy of previous urate-lowering drugs and reasons for discontinuation were collected. Specific information about the dose, effect on serum urate, adverse effects and liver function tests after commencing benzbromarone was recorded.\nRESULTS: Completed questionnaires were returned for 123 of 164 (75%) patients. Mean (SD) serum urate prior to benzbromarone was 0.57 (0.12) mmol\/L, and estimated glomerular filtration rate was 50.3 (22.8) mL\/min\/1.73 m(2) . The median dose of benzbromarone was 100 mg\/day (25-200 mg\/day). Six months after commencing benzbromarone, mean (SD) serum urate was 0.35 (0.12) mmol\/L. Benzbromarone-related adverse events included rash (n = 4), diarrhoea (n = 9), nausea (n = 6) and urate stones (n = 3). Liver function test abnormalities were uncommon and tended to be mild. There were 14 patient deaths; none was considered related to benzbromarone. Allopurinol had been prescribed prior to benzbromarone in 117 of 123 patients; median maximum allopurinol dose was 200 mg\/day (range 25-600 mg\/day), and 19% patients received allopurinol >300 mg\/day.\nCONCLUSION: Benzbromarone provides useful urate-lowering efficacy and does not appear unsafe in patients with gout.

Underutilization of urate-lowering therapy (ULT) is thought to be common, via both suboptimal dosing and poor medication adherence. The aims of this study were to determine the prevalence of self-reported gout and the key predictors of ULT use in those with gout in a representative population survey in South Australia.\nMETHODS: Data were obtained from the Spring 2015 South Australian Health Omnibus Survey, a multilevel, systematic, survey in a representative population sample involving face-to-face interviews (n = 3005). This study analyzed responses from respondents aged ≥ 25 years (n = 2531) about self-reported gout, ULT use, sociodemographic factors, lifestyle factors, and comorbidities, using survey weighting. Univariate and subsequent adjusted logistic regression analyses on self-reported gout were performed. ULT use was divided into three categories (never use, prior use, and current use) and these data were analyzed using a multinomial logistic regression model.\nRESULTS: Self-reported gout prevalence was 6.8% (95% CI 5.8, 7.9). The mean age of respondents with gout was 64 years (standard deviation 16) and 82% were male. As expected, older age, male gender, lower socioeconomic status (SES), and higher body mass index (BMI) were associated with gout, as were high alcohol consumption, current smoking, other forms of arthritis, and hypertension or hypercholesterolemia medication, after adjustment for sociodemographic variables. Two thirds of respondents with gout reported ULT use (36% current; 29% previous) with only 55% continuing treatment. Predictors of ULT use included male gender, low SES, and concomitant cholesterol-lowering therapy. Respondents with gout with a higher BMI were more likely to remain on ULT.\nCONCLUSIONS: Despite gout being a common, potentially disabling joint disease, only 55% of respondents with gout in this study adhered to ULT. Identification of key predictors of ULT use will provide guidance on prescribing strategy in clinical practice and on the quality of gout care in the community.",

Adherence to urate-lowering therapy (ULT) can be difficult for patients due to barriers, which include medication burden, financial hardship, and lack of medical literacy. Our aim was to create a pharmacist-managed referral for the titration of ULT to target serum uric acid (sUA) levels in a complex patient population. We utilized a clinical database to query patients seen at a rheumatology clinic over a 12-month period with an ICD-10 diagnosis for gout. The referral criteria were indications for ULT per the 2012 ACR guidelines. Rheumatology providers, consisting of attendings, fellows, and a physician assistant, were asked to refer the identified patients to the pharmacist-managed titration program. The intervention group consisted of 19 referred patients and the control group consisted of 28 non-referred patients. The baseline sUA (median (IQR)) at the time of referral was 8.8 (2) mg\/dL for the intervention group and 7.6 (2.8) mg\/dL for the control group (p = 0.2). At the end of the study period, the sUA was 6.1 (1.4) mg\/dL for the intervention group and 6.8 (3.2) mg\/dL for the control group (p = 0.08). At the end of the study period, 6 of 19 (32%) intervention group and 7 of 28 (25%) control group were at goal (p = 0.3).
