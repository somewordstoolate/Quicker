    "Explanations": {
        "a": "There were some concerns with the risk of bias of the 2 largest trials (Wolfe 2021 and Jardine 2010) because they were both post hoc subgroup analyses. ",
        "b": "There were some concerns with risk of bias because one study (Goicoechea 2018) did not blind patients nor carers.",
        "c": "There were only 185 events among the 7952 participants enrolled in the 3 trials. The total number of events is lower than the number needed to reach the optimal information size (i.e., 300).",
        "d": "There were some concerns with 2 trials (Goicoechea 2018 and Saito 2011) because they did not blind patients nor carers.",
        "e": "There were some concerns with the risk of bias because 4 of the 5 trials were post hoc subgroup analyses.",
        "f": "I2 from meta-analysis was greater than 50%, suggesting some heterogeneity in results. There was a wide range of effect estimates.",
        "g": "There were only 205 events among the 7952 participants enrolled in the 3 trials. The total number of events is lower than the number needed to reach the optimal information size (i.e., 300).",
        "h": "There were only 198 events among the 7952 participants enrolled in the 3 trials. The total number of events is lower than the number needed to reach the optimal information size (i.e., 300).",
        "i": "Not enough information is reported to assess precision.",
        "j": "There were some concerns with risk of bias because 2 studies were post hoc subgroup analyses and the other study did not blind patients nor carers."
