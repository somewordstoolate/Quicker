        "Title":"Second-generation antipsychotics and risk of cerebrovascular accidents in the elderly",
        "Abstract":"Concern has been recently raised for risperidone and olanzapine, possibly associated with cerebrovascular events in placebo-controlled trials conducted in elderly subjects with dementia. We investigated the relationship between exposure to second-generation antipsychotics (SGAs) and occurrence of cerebrovascular accidents in the elderly. From the regional database of hospital admissions of Lombardy, Italy, we extracted all patients aged 65 or older with cerebrovascular-related outcomes for the year 2002. From the regional database of prescriptions reimbursed by the National Health Service, we extracted all patients aged 65 or older who received antipsychotic prescriptions during 2001. The 2 databases were linked anonymously using the individual patient code. The proportions of cerebrovascular accidents were 3.31% (95% confidence interval, 2.95-3.69) in elderly subjects exclusively exposed to SGAs and 2.37% (95% confidence interval, 2.19-2.57) in elderly subjects exclusively exposed to first-generation antipsychotics. After background group differences were controlled for, exposure to SGAs significantly increased the risk of accidents. The analysis of cerebrovascular events in elderly subjects exposed to each individual SGA, in comparison with exposure to haloperidol, showed a significantly increased risk for risperidone only (adjusted odds ratio, 1.43; 95% confidence interval, 1.12-1.93). These data provide preliminary epidemiological evidence that exposure to SGAs, in comparison with exposure to first-generation antipsychotics, significantly increased the risk of cerebrovascular accidents in the elderly.\n",

All patients were maintained on their prestudy psychoactive and anti-Parkinson medications, without alteration, throughout the study. The elderly group received 1.5 g acetazolamide and thiamine per day in three divided doses for 3 weeks. The younger group received 1.5 g thiamine and 2.0 g acetazolamide per day in divided doses for 2 months. Both groups showed a significant decrease in scores on the Abnormal Involuntary Movement Scale (TD) and the Simpson-Angus Neurological Rating Scale (parkinsonism) while on A + T. The A + T effects were unrelated to age, gender, diagnosis, or maintenance medications.\n",

        "Abstract":"OBJECTIVE: To establish the instantaneous relative risk (RR) of death associated with individual antipsychotic drugs, carbamazepine and sodium valproate for those 65 years and older.\nMETHODS: Subjects dispensed antipsychotic drugs, sodium valproate or carbamazepine in 2003 or 2004 were analyzed as incident (N = 16,634) or prevalent (N = 9,831) users. Survival curves, mortality rates, and Cox proportional hazards models over two time periods were used to explore risk of death. The models were adjusted for age, sex, residential status, and psychotropic and medical drug dispensing. Olanzapine subjects were the reference group in the Cox regression. Subanalyses were performed for incident subjects with more than 30 days of follow-up and those dispensed cholinesterase inhibitors.\nRESULTS: In the adjusted Cox proportional hazards models, haloperidol dispensing was consistently associated with an increased risk of death compared with olanzapine users (relative risk [RR] for incident users: 2.26, 95% confidence intervals (CI): 2.08-2.47; Wald statistic: 345.36, df = 1, p < or =0.001). There was some evidence of decreased survival with dispensing of higher haloperidol doses, although confounding by medical comorbidity cannot be excluded. Chlorpromazine (RR: 1.39, 95% CI: 1.15-1.67; Wald statistic: 12.08, df = 1, p <0.001) and risperidone (RR: 1.23, 95% CI: 1.07-1.40; Wald statistic: 9.12, df = 1, p = 0.003) dispensing were associated with increased risk of death in incident users.\nCONCLUSION: These results should be interpreted cautiously because haloperidol and chlorpromazine are used in broader clinical contexts. However, in the absence of data from randomized trials, the safety profile of haloperidol should not be assumed to be benign. Antipsychotic drugs should not be studied as an aggregated group because their associated risks are not uniform.\n",

        "Abstract":"Using (11)C-raclopride positron emission tomography after methamphetamine challenge, we have evaluated regional brain changes in synaptic dopamine (DA) levels in six volunteers and six advanced Parkinson's disease (PD) patients. The pharmacological challenge induced significant release of endogenous DA in putamen not only in the normal subjects, as reflected by a 25.2% reduction in (11)C-raclopride binding potential as compared with placebo, but also in the PD patients (6.8%). In individual PD patients, we found a correlation between putamen DA release and DA storage, as measured by (18)F-dopa uptake. Localization of significant changes in (11)C-raclopride binding after methamphetamine at a voxel level with statistical parametric mapping identified striatal and prefrontal DA release in both cohorts. Statistical comparisons between normal subjects and PD confirmed significantly reduced DA release in striatal areas in PD, but normal levels of prefrontal DA release. In conclusion, significant endogenous DA release can still be induced by pharmacological challenges in the putamen of advanced PD patients, and this release correlates with residual DA storage capacity. Our data also show that the capacity to release normal DA levels in prefrontal areas after a pharmacological challenge is preserved in severe stages of the disease.\n",

        "Abstract":"1. The pA2 anti-acetylcholine activity in vitro for benapryzine was 6.55 compared with 9.02 for benzhexol.2. In vivo, the anti-acetylcholine activity of benapryzine relative to benzhexol was 0.038 as assessed by the mydriatic response of mice after subcutaneous administration. The relative activity assessed by the inhibition of pilocarpine-induced salivation was 0.13 after oral administration and 0.056 following subcutaneous administration of the drugs.3. Benapryzine had the same order of activity as benzhexol in inhibiting oxotremorine-induced tremors in mice.4. Benapryzine had anticonvulsant properties but no analgesic activity, whilst in high doses it antagonized the extrapyramidal symptoms induced by perphenazine in rats.5. In patients benapryzine was effective in reducing the symptoms of Parkinson's disease without overt anti-cholinergic effects or central hallucinogenic actions.6. Benapryzine abolished the excess tremor and reduced the rigidity and akinesia induced by physostigmine in Parkinsonian subjects.\n",

        "Abstract":"BACKGROUND: Numerous observational studies have reported an increased risk of mortality for conventional antipsychotics in elderly patients, and for haloperidol in particular. Subsequently, health authorities have warned against use of conventional antipsychotics in dementia. Experimental evidence is lacking.\nOBJECTIVE: To assess the mortality risk of conventional antipsychotics in elderly patients with a meta-analysis of trials.\nMETHODS: Original studies were identified in electronic databases, online trial registers, and hand-searched references of published reviews. Two investigators found 28 potentially eligible studies, and they selected 17 randomized placebo-controlled trials in elderly patients with dementia, delirium, or a high risk of delirium. Two investigators independently abstracted trial characteristics and deaths, and 3 investigators assessed the risk of bias. Deaths were pooled with RevMan to obtain risk differences and risk ratios.\nRESULTS: Data of 17 trials with a total of 2387 participants were available. Thirty-two deaths occurred. The pooled risk difference of 0.1% was not statistically significant (95% confidence interval (CI) -1.0%-1.2%). The risk ratio was 1.07 (95% CI 0.54-2.13). Eleven of 17 trials tested haloperidol (n = 1799). The risk difference was 0.4% (95% CI -0.9%-1.6%), the risk ratio was 1.25 (95% CI 0.59-2.65).\nCONCLUSIONS: This meta-analysis of placebo-controlled randomized trials does not show that conventional antipsychotics in general or haloperidol in particular increase the risk of mortality in elderly patients. It questions the observational findings and the warning based on these findings. Copyright © 2015 AMDA - The Society for Post-Acute and Long-Term Care Medicine. Published by Elsevier Inc.

        "Abstract":"BACKGROUND: In addition to demonstrating their superiority to placebo, there is a need to compare the relative efficacy and side effects of atypical neuroleptics for the acute treatment of dementia-related behavioral disturbances in residents of long-term care facilities.\nMETHOD: In a double-blind parallel study allowing dose titration over 14 days, 39 agitated persons with DSM-IV dementia who were residing in long-term care facilities were administered olanzapine (N = 20) or risperidone (N = 19) as acute treatment. Drug was administered once a day at bedtime. The initial dosages were olanzapine, 2.5 mg\/day, and risperidone, 0.5 mg\/day. Titration was allowed to maximum doses of olanzapine, 10 mg\/day, and risperidone, 2.0 mg\/day. The primary outcome measures were the Clinical Global Impressions scale (CGI) and the Neuropsychiatric Inventory (NPI). Data were gathered from 2000 to 2002.\nRESULTS: Both drugs produced significant reductions in CGI and NPI scores (p <.0001), but there was no significant difference between drugs. The mean olanzapine dose was 6.65 mg\/day; for risperidone, the dose was 1.47 mg\/day. The positive drug effect was not accompanied by decreased mobility, and there was improvement on a quality-of-life measure. The chief adverse events were drowsiness and falls. At baseline, 42% (16\/38) of subjects in both groups had extrapyramidal symptoms that increased slightly, but not significantly, by the end of the study.\nCONCLUSION: Low-dose, once-a-day olanzapine and risperidone appear to be equally safe and equally effective in the treatment of dementia-related behavioral disturbances in residents of extended care facilities.\n",

        "Abstract":"The aim of this study was to evaluate the effectiveness and tolerability of both amisulpride and risperidone for treating the behavioral and psychological symptoms of dementia in patients with dementia of the Alzheimer type (DAT). Twenty-eight patients with DAT were randomly assigned to treatment with either amisulpride or risperidone for 8 weeks. The effectiveness of the treatments was assessed with the Neuropsychiatric Inventory (NPI) and the Clinical Global Impression-Severity of Illness (CGI-S) scale. The Simpson-Angus Rating Scale, the Barnes Akathisia Rating Scale and the Abnormal Involuntary Movement Scale were used for the assessment of side effects. The NPI and CGI-S scores were significantly decreased over time in both treatment groups without any significant group difference and time by treatment group interaction effect (F=71.85, p<0.0001). There were no serious adverse events in both groups. This study showed that either amisulpride or risperidone would be effective and tolerable for treating patients with DAT.

The main outcome measure for efficacy was change in the Brief Psychiatric Rating Scale (BPRS) from baseline to 10 weeks of therapy. For tolerability it was change in the Unified PD Rating Scale (UPDRS) motor section over the same time period. The trial was confounded by the need for a design change and incomplete recruitment.\nRESULTS: No significant differences in the primary or secondary outcome measures of efficacy were observed. An unexpectedly large placebo effect, inadequate dosage (mean 120 mg\/day), and inadequate power may have contributed to lack of demonstrable benefit. Quetiapine was generally well-tolerated and did not worsen parkinsonism, but was associated with a trend toward a decline on a measure of daily functioning.\nCONCLUSIONS: Quetiapine was well-tolerated and did not worsen parkinsonism. Although conclusions about efficacy may be limited, the drug in the dosages used did not show demonstrable benefit for treating agitation or psychosis in patients with dementia and parkinsonism. These findings are in keeping with prior studies reporting limited efficacy of various medications for reducing behavioral problems in demented patients.\n",

        "Abstract":"BACKGROUND: Among patients with Alzheimer's disease who have had a response to antipsychotic medication for psychosis or agitation-aggression, the risk of a recurrence of symptoms after discontinuation of the medication has not been established.\nMETHODS: Patients with Alzheimer's disease and psychosis or agitation-aggression received open-label treatment with risperidone for 16 weeks. Those who had a response to risperidone therapy were then randomly assigned, in a double-blind fashion, to one of three regimens: continued risperidone therapy for 32 weeks (group 1), risperidone therapy for 16 weeks followed by placebo for 16 weeks (group 2), or placebo for 32 weeks (group 3). The primary outcome was the time to relapse of psychosis or agitation.\nRESULTS: A total of 180 patients received open-label risperidone (mean dose, 0.97 mg daily). The severity of psychosis and agitation were reduced, although there was a mild increase in extrapyramidal signs; 112 patients met the criteria for response to treatment, of whom 110 underwent randomization. In the first 16 weeks after randomization, the rate of relapse was higher in the group that received placebo than in the groups that received risperidone (60% [24 of 40 patients in group 3] vs. 33% [23 of 70 in groups 1 and 2]; P=0.004; hazard ratio with placebo, 1.94; 95% confidence interval [CI], 1.09 to 3.45; P=0.02). During the next 16 weeks, the rate of relapse was higher in the group that was switched from risperidone to placebo than in the group that continued to receive risperidone (48% [13 of 27 patients in group 2] vs. 15% [2 of 13 in group 1]; P=0.02; hazard ratio, 4.88; 95% CI, 1.08 to 21.98; P=0.02). The rates of adverse events and death after randomization did not differ significantly among the groups, although comparisons were based on small numbers of patients, especially during the final 16 weeks.\nCONCLUSIONS: In patients with Alzheimer's disease who had psychosis or agitation that had responded to risperidone therapy for 4 to 8 months, discontinuation of risperidone was associated with an increased risk of relapse.

        "Abstract":"Among dementia patients in long-term care facilities, neuroleptics (NL) are frequently prescribed for the treatment of agitation. Although good clinical practice and federal law mandate attempts at withdrawal of these medications, empiric data regarding the cessation of NL treatment are limited in this population. The objective of the present study was to assess through direct observation the effects of short-term NL withdrawal on physically aggressive behavior and other aspects of agitation. We carried out a randomized, double-blind, baseline NL-controlled 4-week trial of the effects of NL withdrawal in 36 institutionalized patients with possible or probable Alzheimer's disease. Patients were directly observed for four 2-hour sessions during baseline, a prerandomization week, and during weeks 1, 2, and 4 of the double-blind portion of the study. Completion of the 4 weeks of double-blind medication and number of observed episodes of physically aggressive behavior (PAB) were the two primary outcome measures. Of the 22 patients who were withdrawn from NL, 20 (91%) completed the 4-week double-blinded withdrawal. Two patients were discontinued from the study due to unacceptable levels of agitation at the request of their nursing staff. Of the 14 patients not withdrawn, all completed the 4-week trial. The chi-square test for the difference between groups was not significant (P > .05). Based on the observed instances of PAB, there was no significant difference (P > .05) between withdrawn and not-withdrawn subjects. Half of the withdrawn patients remained off NLs for an extended period of time after the end of the study, even after the blind was broken. Withdrawing institutionalized dementia patients from NLs was successful in most but not all study patients. Generalization of these results is limited by the highly selected nature of the participants. Unmasking of unmanageable agitation and physical aggressiveness in a small minority must be weighed against the benefits of removing unnecessary medication in the majority of dementia patients in whom NL withdrawal is attempted. PAB itself should not drive continuing NL use without regard to objective assessment of efficacy of the NL treatment.\n",

Patients meeting the consensus criteria for DLB and exhibiting parkinsonism and visual hallucinations were selected from the initial study. Psychosis was assessed with the Neuropsychiatric Inventory\/Nursing Home (NPI-NH) version and the Brief Psychiatric Rating Scale (BPRS). Extrapyramidal symptoms were evaluated with the Simpson-Angus scale.\nRESULTS: Twenty-nine patients met the criteria for DLB; 10 were randomized to placebo, 5 received 5 mg of olanzapine, 7 received 10 mg of olanzapine and 7 received 15 mg of olanzapine. Patients with DLB treated with 5 mg of olanzapine showed significant reductions in delusions and hallucinations. Patients treated with 10 mg showed a significant reduction in the NPI-NH delusion subscale score. No significant differences were found between the 15-mg group and the placebo group. Confirmatory findings emerged from an analysis of the BPRS. Caregivers reported decreased disruptions in their occupational routines for the group receiving 5 or 10 mg of olanzapine. There was no significant exacerbation of parkinsonian symptoms in any study group, no decrement in Mini-Mental State Examination scores in any of the treatment groups, and symptoms suggestive of anticholinergic toxicity did not differ among treatment groups.\nCONCLUSIONS: This preliminary analysis suggests that olanzapine (5 or 10 mg) reduces psychosis in patients with DLB without worsening parkinsonism.

        "Abstract":"It has been shown that elderly patients with dementia treated with atypical and conventional antipsychotics have a twofold increased risk of cerebrovascular adverse events (CVAEs). To investigate the temporal relationship between exposure to antipsychotics and the risk of CVAE, a case-control analysis nested within a cohort of 26,157 community-dwelling patients (mean age 76 +\/- 9.7) with at least one antipsychotic prescription was conducted. Data were used from Dutch community pharmacies and hospital discharge records. Five hundred and eighteen cases of hospital admission for CVAE were identified. For each case, four randomly selected controls matched by sex and age were sampled from the cohort. To evaluate the temporal relationship between antipsychotic use and the occurrence of CVAE, two measures were used: the first being a current, recent or past user, and the second for the current users, the duration of use up to the index date. In addition, the cumulative exposure was assessed. Current and recent exposure to antipsychotics were associated with an increased risk of CVAE compared with non-users (odds ratio [OR] 1.7, CI 1.4-2.2). A strong temporal relationship was found; the OR for a history of use less than a week is 9.9 (5.7-17.2). The risk decreases in time and is comparable to non-users after 3 months of use (OR 1.0, CI 0.7-1.3). Cumulative exposure was not associated with an increase in risk. The risk of CVAE in elderly patients associated with antipsychotics is elevated especially during the first weeks of treatment. This risk decreases over time and is back on base level after 3 months of treatment. Chronic use is not associated with CVAE.\n",

        "Title":"Neuropsychiatric Symptoms in Parkinson's Disease",
        "Abstract":"Parkinson's disease (PD) is characterized by motor symptoms, but focused and extensive research in the last years has provided new knowledge in the field of non-motor symptoms. Non-motor symptoms include neuropsychiatric symptoms such as depression, anxiety, psychosis, apathy, impulse control disorders, and occur in the majority of patients with PD. They are associated with impaired quality of life for patients and relatives, additional deterioration of function and increased use of health resources. Medical and surgical therapies commonly used for treatment of PD can induce or worsen such symptoms. This paper discusses the epidemiology, clinical features and treatment approaches for neuropsychiatric symptoms (NPS) in PD in the perspective of clinical practice and management. The prevalence rates of various NPS are high, various demographic, clinical and treatment related variables have shown to be associated with higher risk of NPS. Randomized controlled trials of pharmacological and non-pharmacological treatments of NPS in PD are sparse. Current evidence supports tricyclic antidepressants as efficacious treatment of depression in PD and antipsychotic clozapine as efficacious choice for psychosis. Further studies to evaluate various other management strategies of NPS in PD are required. Neuropsychiatric symptoms in PD should be considered an integral part of the disease; hence a multidisciplinary approach is essential to improve the overall outcome of PD also through raised awareness and enriched knowledge on NPS.\n",

        "Abstract":"OBJECTIVE: The study measured the effects of atypical antipsychotics on psychiatric and behavioral symptoms in patients with Alzheimer's disease and psychosis or agitated behavior.\nMETHOD: The Clinical Antipsychotic Trials of Intervention Effectiveness-Alzheimer's Disease (CATIE-AD) Alzheimer's disease effectiveness study included 421 outpatients with Alzheimer's disease and psychosis or agitated\/aggressive behavior. Patients were assigned randomly to masked, flexible-dose treatment with olanzapine, quetiapine, risperidone, or placebo for up to 36 weeks. Patients could be randomly reassigned to a different medication at the clinician's discretion, which ended phase 1. Psychiatric and behavioral symptoms, functioning, cognition, care needs, and quality of life were measured at regular intervals.\nRESULTS: In relation to placebo, the last observation in phase 1 showed greater improvement with olanzapine or risperidone on the Neuropsychiatric Inventory total score, risperidone on the Clinical Global Impression of Changes, olanzapine and risperidone on the Brief Psychiatric Rating Scale (BPRS) hostile suspiciousness factor, and risperidone on the BPRS psychosis factor. There was worsening with olanzapine on the BPRS withdrawn depression factor. Among patients continuing phase 1 treatment at 12 weeks, there were no significant differences between antipsychotics and placebo on cognition, functioning, care needs, or quality of life, except for worsened functioning with olanzapine compared to placebo.\nCONCLUSION: In this descriptive analysis of outpatients with Alzheimer's disease in usual care settings, some clinical symptoms improved with atypical antipsychotics. Antipsychotics may be more effective for particular symptoms, such as anger, aggression, and paranoid ideas. They do not appear to improve functioning, care needs, or quality of life.\n",

        "Abstract":"INTRODUCTION: Presence of disruptive behavioural and psychological symptoms in dementia (BPSD) is highly prevalent and, as a consequence, neuroleptics are frequently used in these patients to control BPSD. Several reviews have shown the clinical equivalence of different classes of neuroleptics in BPSD control, although that equivalence has been only indirectly assessed by comparing the combined results of different types of active drugs versus placebo. Thus, little is known on the comparative effectiveness, head to head, of different neuroleptics on BPSD. The aim of this study was to gather preliminary information on the effectiveness of typical (haloperidol, thioridazine) and atypical (olanzapine, risperidone) neuroleptics on BPSD.\nMETHODS: Multicenter, observational and retrospective study using chart reviews of patients with dementia to assess neuroleptic prescriptions and clinical outcomes at 12 weeks on treatment.\nRESULTS: No significant differences on BPSD improvement were found by type of neuroleptic (n=78; Kruskal- Wallis exact test; p=0.47). There also were no differences by neuroleptics when the analysis was stratified by levels of cognitive decline (Kruskal-Wallis exact test; p=0.86 and 0.87 for moderate and severe levels of deterioration, respectively). Recorded side effects were worse in the haloperidol group (n=19) regarding rigidity (Fisher's exact; p=0.01), tremor (Fisher's exact p=0.03) and akathisia (Fisher's exact; p=0.03).\nCONCLUSIONS: Our findings support the equivalence in effectiveness of several classes of neuroleptics commonly used to treat BPSD. Nevertheless these results need to be confirmed by adequately powered randomized trials and further pharmacoepidemiological studies to assess their safety.\n",

        "Abstract":"BACKGROUND: Second-generation (atypical) antipsychotic drugs are widely used to treat psychosis, aggression, and agitation in patients with Alzheimer's disease, but their benefits are uncertain and concerns about safety have emerged. We assessed the effectiveness of atypical antipsychotic drugs in outpatients with Alzheimer's disease.\nMETHODS: In this 42-site, double-blind, placebo-controlled trial, 421 outpatients with Alzheimer's disease and psychosis, aggression, or agitation were randomly assigned to receive olanzapine (mean dose, 5.5 mg per day), quetiapine (mean dose, 56.5 mg per day), risperidone (mean dose, 1.0 mg per day), or placebo. Doses were adjusted as needed, and patients were followed for up to 36 weeks. The main outcomes were the time from initial treatment to the discontinuation of treatment for any reason and the number of patients with at least minimal improvement on the Clinical Global Impression of Change (CGIC) scale at 12 weeks.\nRESULTS: There were no significant differences among treatments with regard to the time to the discontinuation of treatment for any reason: olanzapine (median, 8.1 weeks), quetiapine (median, 5.3 weeks), risperidone (median, 7.4 weeks), and placebo (median, 8.0 weeks) (P=0.52). The median time to the discontinuation of treatment due to a lack of efficacy favored olanzapine (22.1 weeks) and risperidone (26.7 weeks) as compared with quetiapine (9.1 weeks) and placebo (9.0 weeks) (P=0.002). The time to the discontinuation of treatment due to adverse events or intolerability favored placebo. Overall, 24% of patients who received olanzapine, 16% of patients who received quetiapine, 18% of patients who received risperidone, and 5% of patients who received placebo discontinued their assigned treatment owing to intolerability (P=0.009). No significant differences were noted among the groups with regard to improvement on the CGIC scale. Improvement was observed in 32% of patients assigned to olanzapine, 26% of patients assigned to quetiapine, 29% of patients assigned to risperidone, and 21% of patients assigned to placebo (P=0.22).\nCONCLUSIONS: Adverse effects offset advantages in the efficacy of atypical antipsychotic drugs for the treatment of psychosis, aggression, or agitation in patients with Alzheimer's disease.

        "Abstract":"A Geriatric Home Hospitalization Service (GHHS) has been operating in Torino at S. Giovanni Battista Hospital since 1985. GHHS allows us to perform diagnostic and therapeutic interventions, which are usually made in hospital, also at home. GHHS team includes geriatricians, nurses, physiotherapists, social workers and counselors. Between February 1999 and April 2002, the GHH Service conducted a randomized controlled trial on 109 elderly, demented patients requiring admission to the Hospital Emergency Department (ED)for acute illnesses. Objective of the study was to identify the benefits of the care in a GHHScompared to a general medical ward (GMW) in reducing behavioral disturbances in elderly patients with advanced dementia and in lowering caregiver's stress. Patients were randomly assigned to GHHS (56 patients) or to GMW (53 patients). Both groups were examined using the same protocol and were evaluated on admission and on discharge. All patients had a severe form of dementia as shown by the clinical dementia rating (CDR) scale mean value (3.7 +\/- 0.9) with an important functional impairment and a relevant degree of comorbidity. The main reasons for hospitalization were infections, cerebrovascular accidents and malnutrition. Mortality of total sample was 19.3 %, without significant differences in the two settings of care. On discharge, in GHHS patients there was a significant reduction of behavioral disturbances. The use of anti-psychotic drugs was significantly lower in GHHS patients compared to the GMW group (p < 0.001). The stress of caregivers on discharge was reduced only in GHHS group and not in the control ones. In conclusion, we can say that a GHHS continuous support allows us to reduce the family caregiver's stress. When treated at home, demented patients do not have to change their environment or routine and it is possible to have a better control on behavioral disturbances.\n",

        "Abstract":"OBJECTIVE: The goal of this study was to compare the efficacy and side effects of two doses of haloperidol and placebo in the treatment of psychosis and disruptive behaviors in patients with Alzheimer's disease.\nMETHOD: In a 6-week random-assignment, double-blind, placebo-controlled trial (phase A), haloperidol, 2-3 mg\/day (standard dose), and haloperidol, 0.50-0.75 mg\/day (low dose), were compared in 71 outpatients with Alzheimer's disease. For the subsequent 6-week double-blind crossover phase (phase B), patients taking standard- or low-dose haloperidol were switched to placebo, and patients taking placebo were randomly assigned to standard- or low-dose haloperidol.\nRESULTS: For the 60 patients who completed phase A, standard-dose haloperidol was efficacious and superior to both low-dose haloperidol and placebo for scores on the Brief Psychiatric Rating Scale psychosis factor and on psychomotor agitation. Response rates according to three sets of criteria were greater with the standard dose (55%-60%) than the low dose (25%-35%) and placebo (25%-30%). The advantage of standard dose over low dose was replicated in phase B. In phase A, extrapyramidal signs tended to be greater with the standard dose than in the other two conditions, primarily because of a subgroup (20%) who developed moderate to severe signs. Low-dose haloperidol did not differ from placebo on any measure of efficacy or side effects.\nCONCLUSIONS: The results indicated a favorable therapeutic profile for haloperidol in doses of 2-3 mg\/day, although a subgroup developed moderate to severe extrapyramidal signs. A starting dose of 1 mg\/day with gradual, upward dose titration is recommended. The narrow therapeutic window observed with haloperidol may also apply to other neuroleptics used in Alzheimer's disease patients with psychosis and disruptive behaviors.\n",

They were randomly assigned to receive flexible doses (0.5 to 2 mg\/day) of haloperidol or risperidone. Clinical response was evaluated using the Cohen-Mansfield Agitation Inventory (CMAI), the Behavioral Pathology in Alzheimer's Disease Rating Scale (BEHAVE-AD), Simpson-Angus Scale, Functional Assessment Staging and Cantonese version of the Mini-Mental State Examination.\nRESULTS: The mean doses at the last week were 0.90 mg\/day of haloperidol and 0.85 mg\/day of risperidone. Both haloperidol and risperidone significantly reduced the severity of BPSD (scores on CMAI and BEHAVE-AD), with no significant between-group differences. Haloperidol-treated patients showed a worsening on Simpson-Angus scale while there was no significant change in this measure in risperidone-treated patients.\nCONCLUSIONS: Low-dose haloperidol and risperidone were well tolerated and associated with reductions in the severity and frequency of behavioural symptoms in subjects with dementia.

        "Abstract":"Brexpiprazole is an antipsychotic medication and received approval by the U.S. Food and Drug Administration for the treatment of schizophrenia in July 2015. Brexpiprazole acts as a partial agonist at dopamine D2 and serotonin 5-HT1A receptors, and as an antagonist at serotonin 5-HT2A and at adrenergic alpha1B and alpha2C receptors. Compared with aripiprazole, brexpiprazole is more potent at 5-HT1A receptors and displays less intrinsic activity at D2 receptors. The recommended dose range of brexpiprazole for the treatment of schizophrenia is 2-4 mg\/day; the recommended titration schedule is to start with 1 mg\/day and increase to 2 mg\/day on Day 5 to Day 7, then to 4 mg\/day on Day 8. Two positive, 6-week, Phase 3 randomized controlled trials in acute schizophrenia demonstrated superiority of brexpiprazole over placebo. Pooled responder rates were 46% for brexpiprazole 2-4 mg\/day vs. 31% for placebo, resulting in a number needed to treat (NNT) of 7. In a 52-week, randomized withdrawal study, significantly fewer patients relapsed in the brexpiprazole group compared with placebo (13.5% vs. 38.5%), resulting in an NNT of 4. The most commonly encountered adverse event (incidence >=4% and at least twice the rate of placebo) is increased weight. Short-term weight gain appears modest (approximately 10% of patients receiving brexpiprazole 1-4 mg\/day gained >=7% body weight from baseline, compared with 4% for those randomized to placebo, resulting in a number needed to harm [NNH] of 17); however, more outliers with an increase of >=7% of body weight were evident in open-label, 52-week safety studies. Effects on glucose and lipids were small. Rates of akathisia as an adverse event were 5.5% for the pooled doses of brexpiprazole 1-4 mg\/day vs. 4.6% for placebo, yielding an NNH of 112. Minimal effects on prolactin were observed, and no clinically relevant effects on the ECG QTc interval were evident. Brexpiprazole is also approved as an adjunct medication for the treatment of major depressive disorder. Phase 3 trials are ongoing in patients with agitation associated with Alzheimer's disease.\n",

        "Abstract":"We aimed to evaluate predictors and mediators of enhancing effect of adjunctive mirtazapine on cognition in schizophrenia. Patients with difficult-to-treat schizophrenia received either mirtazapine (n = 19) or placebo (n = 18) in a double-blind fashion for six weeks. Mirtazapine outperformed placebo on the Block Design and Stroop Dots. In the present subsidiary study, factors underlying this difference were explored with Path Analysis. Add-on mirtazapine had an independent enhancing effect on the Block Design-measured visuo-spatial functioning. Further, this effect was mediated via changes in positive, depressive and parkinsonism symptoms, but not in negative symptoms. This effect was predicted by higher doses of FGAs, longer duration of illness and lower initial Block Design scores. Path Analysis model fit was good. Mirtazapine may have direct and indirect favorable effects on visuo-spatial functioning, but further research is needed. Path analysis may be a feasible statistical method for further research of neurocognition in psychopharmacological interventions in schizophrenia.

Four hundred seventy-three patients were randomly assigned to placebo (N = 238) or 1.0 to 1.5 mg risperidone per day (N = 235). Coprimary efficacy end points were: changes in scores on the Behavioral pathology in Alzheimer's Disease (BEHAVE-AD) Psychosis subscale and Clinical Global Impression of Change (CGI-C).

Secondary measures included NPI-NH Total, Clinical Global Impression-Severity of Illness (CGI-S), Brief Psychiatric Rating Scale (BPRS) Core and Total, and the Cohen-Mansfield Agitation Inventory (CMAI) scores.\nRESULTS: Aripiprazole 10 mg\/day showed significantly greater improvements (mean change [2 x SD]) than placebo on the NPI-NH Psychosis Subscale (-6.87 [8.6] versus -5.13 [10.0]; F = 6.29, df = 1, 422, p = 0.013 by analysis of covariance [ANCOVA]); CGI-S (-0.72 [1.8] versus -0.46 [1.6]; F = 4.68, df = 1, 419, p = 0.031 [ANCOVA]); BPRS Total (-7.12 [18.4] versus -4.17 [21.6]; F = 4.72, df = 1, 399, p = 0.030 [ANCOVA]); BPRS Core (-3.07 [6.9] versus -1.74 [7.8]; F = 7.30, df = 1, 407, p = 0.007 [ANCOVA]); CMAI (-10.96 [22.6] versus -6.64 [28.6]; F = 5.23, df = 1, 410, p = 0.023 [ANCOVA]), and NPI-NH Psychosis response rate (65 versus 50%; chi(2) = 5.52, df = 1, p = 0.019 [CMH]). Aripiprazole 5 mg\/day showed significant improvements versus placebo on BPRS and CMAI scores. Aripiprazole 2 mg\/day was not efficacious. Cerebrovascular adverse events were reported: aripiprazole 2 mg\/day, N = 1; 5 mg\/day, N = 2; 10 mg\/day, N = 4; placebo, N = 0. No deaths in any group (aripiprazole 2 mg\/day, 3%; 5 mg\/day, 2%; 10 mg\/day, 7%; placebo, 3%) were considered to be treatment-related.\nCONCLUSION: Aripiprazole 10 mg\/day was efficacious and safe for psychosis associated with AD, significantly improving psychotic symptoms, agitation, and clinical global impression. However, clinicians should be aware of the safety considerations of atypical antipsychotic uses in this population.\n",

        "Abstract":"Behavioural and psychological symptoms in dementia (BPSD) are common and often treated with antipsychotics, which are known to have small efficacy and to cause many side effects. One potential side effect might be cognitive decline. We searched MEDLINE, Scopus, CENTRAL and www.ClincalStudyResult.org for randomized, double-blind, placebo-controlled trials using antipsychotics for treating BPSD and evaluated cognitive functioning. The studies identified were summarized in a meta-analysis with the standardized mean difference (SMD, Hedges's g) as the effect size. Meta-regression was additionally performed to identify associated factors. Ten studies provided data on the course of cognitive functioning. The random effects model of the pooled analysis showed a not significant effect (SMD = -0.065, 95 % CI -0.186 to 0.057, I 2 = 41 %). Meta-regression revealed a significant correlation between cognitive impairment and treatment duration (R 2 = 0.78, p < 0.02) as well as baseline MMSE (R 2 = 0.92, p < 0.005). These correlations depend on only two out of ten studies and should interpret cautiously.\n",

        "Abstract":"In this 10-week, double-blind, fixed-dose study, elderly institutionalized patients with dementia and agitation were randomized (3:3:2) to quetiapine 200mg\/day, 100mg\/day, or placebo. The primary endpoint was change in Positive and Negative Syndrome Scale (PANSS)-Excitement Component (EC) scores at endpoint, analysed using last observation carried forward (LOCF) and observed cases (OC) approaches. Other efficacy measures were the Clinical Global Impression of Change (CGI-C), and response rates (percentage with > or =40% reduction [PANSS-EC]; \"much\" or \"very much improved\" [CGI-C]), Neuropsychiatric Inventory-Nursing Home version (NPI-NH), and Cohen-Mansfield Agitation Inventory (CMAI). The key safety measure was incidence of adverse events; change in Mini-Mental State Examination (MMSE) was also assessed. Baseline characteristics of 333 participants (quetiapine 200mg\/day, n=117; quetiapine 100mg\/day, n=124; placebo, n=92) and completion rates (63-65%) were comparable among groups. Compared with placebo, quetiapine 200mg\/day was associated with clinically greater improvements in PANSS-EC (LOCF, p=0.065; OC, p=0.014 [ANCOVA]), CGI-C (LOCF, p=0.017; OC, p=0.002 [ANOVA]), and CGI-C response rates (LOCF, p=0.002; OC, p<0.001 [Chi-square test]). Quetiapine 100mg\/day did not differentiate from placebo on these measures. There were no between-group differences in NPI-NH or CMAI. Incidences of cerebrovascular adverse events, postural hypotension, and falls were similar among groups. MMSE did not change in any group. Mortality was numerically higher in the quetiapine groups; rates were not statistically different from placebo. The results of this study suggest that quetiapine 200mg\/day was effective and well-tolerated for treating agitation associated with dementia. However, caution should be exercised given the concerns regarding increased mortality with atypical antipsychotics in this vulnerable patient population.\n",

        "Abstract":"We evaluated the most current evidence regarding the benefits and harms of atypical antipsychotics in adults with dementia. In June 2016, following a protocol developed a priori, we systematically searched several databases for published and unpublished data from randomized controlled trials (RCT), observational studies, and meta-analyses; conducted direct meta-analyses using a random effects model; and graded the quality of evidence according to the Grading of Recommendations Assessment, Development and Evaluation (GRADE) working group. One high-quality meta-analysis and published and unpublished data from 8 RCTs and 12 large observational studies met inclusion criteria. When compared with placebo, aripiprazole, risperidone, and olanzapine but not quetiapine result in modest (standardized mean difference <0.5 standard deviations) improvement in neuropsychiatric symptoms. Aripiprazole, risperidone, quetiapine, and olanzapine are associated with increased odds of acute myocardial infraction, and risperidone and olanzapine are associated with increased odds of hip fracture. Observational studies suggest no differences in all-cause mortality between atypical antipsychotics. Observational studies suggest that atypical antipsychotics are associated with lower risk of all-cause mortality and extrapyramidal symptoms but higher risk of stroke when compared with conventional antipsychotics. To manage agitation in adults with progressive dementia, clinicians may recommend atypical antipsychotics with continuous monitoring of behavioral symptoms, informing patients and their families or caregivers of the significant risk of adverse effects and baseline risk of acute myocardial infraction and bone fractures.

        "Abstract":"Deficiencies of specific vitamins produce consistent symptoms of psychiatric disorder. Thiamine deficiency, which is common in alcoholism, can produce confusion and psychotic symptoms, in addition to neurological signs. Vitamin B12 and folate deficiency may contribute symptoms of disorientation, depression or psychosis; their measurement is a part of routine dementia work-ups. Pyridoxine deficiency results in seizures, although the effects of exogenously administered pyridoxine are not clearly understood in depression and anxiety - the disorders in which it is most frequently used clinically. The use of vitamins has been most prominent in psychiatry in the treatment of schizophrenia, where large doses of nicotinic acid were initially given alone and later combined with other vitamins and minerals. Several theoretical models were described to support the use of vitamins in schizophrenia. These included: the parallels of schizophrenia to the psychiatric symptoms of pellagra; hypotheses of a defect in adrenaline metabolism; and the accumulation of psychotoxic substances which produce psychotic symptoms. Initially, positive results were reported over 30 years ago, but have not been replicated by thorough investigations. An extensive series of comprehensive placebo-controlled trials failed to show efficacy for any of the vitamin therapies tested. Although clearly less effective than antipsychotic drug treatment, vitamin therapy is not without risks - adverse effects have been reported with nicotinic acid, pyridoxine and vitamin C.(ABSTRACT TRUNCATED AT 250 WORDS) [References: 48]\n",

Behavioral symptoms were assessed by the Behavior Pathology in Alzheimer's Disease Rating Scale (BEHAVE-AD), the Cohen-Mansfield Agitation Inventory (CMAI), and the Clinical Global Impression (CGI) scale. Tolerability assessments included the Extrapyramidal Symptom Rating Scale, sedation levels, Functional Assessment Staging, Mini-Mental State Examination, and incidence of adverse events.\nRESULTS: The mean dose at endpoint was 1.1 mg\/d of risperidone and 1.2 mg\/d of haloperidol. Although not significant, a higher percentage of patients receiving risperidone than those receiving placebo showed clinical improvement (> or =30% reduction from baseline to endpoint in BEHAVE-AD total score) at endpoint and week 12. Reductions in the BEHAVE-AD total score were significantly greater with risperidone than with placebo at week 12. In a further analysis of aggression, the most dominant symptom in these patients, BEHAVE-AD and CMAI aggression cluster scores were significantly reduced compared with placebo at endpoint and week 12. CGI scores were also significantly reduced at endpoint and week 12. Severity of extrapyramidal symptoms with risperidone did not differ significantly from that of placebo and was less than that of haloperidol. A post hoc analysis showed significantly greater reductions in the BEHAVE-AD aggressiveness score with risperidone than haloperidol at week 12.\nCONCLUSION: Low-dose risperidone (mean 1.1 mg\/d) was well tolerated and associated with reductions in the severity and frequency of behavioral symptoms, particularly aggression, in elderly patients with dementia.\n",

        "Abstract":"OBJECTIVES: To evaluate the clinical and cost-effectiveness of quetiapine, olanzapine and valproate semisodium in the treatment of mania associated with bipolar disorder.\nDATA SOURCES: Electronic databases; industry submissions made to the National Institute for Clinical Excellence.\nREVIEW METHODS: Randomised trials and economic evaluations that evaluated the effectiveness of quetiapine, olanzapine or valproate semisodium in the treatment of mania associated with bipolar disorder were selected for inclusion. Data were extracted by one reviewer into a Microsoft Access database and checked for quality and accuracy by a second. The quality of the cost-effectiveness studies was assessed using a checklist updated from that developed by Drummond and colleagues. Relative risk and mean difference data were presented as Forest plots but only pooled where this made sense clinically and statistically. Studies were grouped by drug and, within each drug, by comparator used. Chi-squared tests of heterogeneity were performed for the outcomes if pooling was indicated. A probabilistic model was developed to estimate costs from the perspective of the NHS, and health outcomes in terms of response rate, based on an improvement of at least 50% in a patient's baseline manic symptoms derived from an interview-based mania assessment scale. The model evaluated the cost-effectiveness of the alternative drugs when used as part of treatment for the acute manic episode only.\nRESULTS: Eighteen randomised trials met the inclusion criteria. Aspects of three of the quetiapine studies were commercial-in-confidence. The quality of the included trials was limited and overall, key methodological criteria were not met in most trials. Quetiapine, olanzapine and valproate semisodium appear superior to placebo in reducing manic symptoms, but may cause side-effects. There appears to be little difference between these treatments and lithium in terms of effectiveness, but quetiapine is associated with somnolence and weight gain, whereas lithium is associated with tremor. Olanzapine as adjunct therapy to mood stabilisers may be more effective than placebo in reducing mania and improving global health, but it is associated with more dry mouth, somnolence, weight gain, increased appetite, tremor and speech disorder. There was little difference between these treatments and haloperidol in reducing mania, but haloperidol was associated with more extrapyramidal side-effects and negative implications for health-related quality of life. Intramuscular olanzapine and lorazepam were equally effective and safe in one very short (24 hour) trial. Valproate semisodium and carbamazepine were equally effective and safe in one small trial in children. Olanzapine may be more effective than valproate semisodium in reducing mania, but was associated with more dry mouth, increased appetite, oedema, somnolence, speech disorder, Parkinson-like symptoms and weight gain. Valproate semisodium was associated with more nausea than olanzapine. The results from the base-case analysis demonstrate that choice of optimal strategy is dependent on the maximum that the health service is prepared to pay per additional responder. For a figure of less than 7179 British pounds per additional responder, haloperidol is the optimal decision; for a spend in excess of this, it would be olanzapine. Under the most favourable scenario in relation to the costs of responders and non-responders beyond the 3-week period considered in the base-case analysis, the incremental cost-effectiveness ratio of olanzapine is reduced to 1236 British pounds.\nCONCLUSIONS: In comparison with placebo, quetiapine, olanzapine and valproate semisodium appear superior in reducing manic symptoms, but all drugs are associated with adverse events. In comparison with lithium, no significant differences were found between the three drugs in terms of effectiveness, and all were associated with adverse events. Several limitations of the cost-effectiveness analysis exist, which inevitably means that the results should be treated with some caution. There remains a need for well-conducted, randomised, double-blind head-to-head comparisons of drugs used in the treatment of mania associated with bipolar disorder and their cost-effectiveness. Participant demographic, diagnostic characteristics, the treatment of mania in children, the use of adjunctive therapy and long-term safety issues in the elderly population, and acute and long-term treatment are also subjects for further study.

        "Abstract":"BACKGROUND: Data from 12-week placebo-controlled trials have led to mounting concerns about increased mortality in patients with Alzheimer's disease (AD) who are prescribed antipsychotics; however, there are no mortality data from long-term placebo-controlled trials. We aimed to assess whether continued treatment with antipsychotics in people with AD is associated with an increased risk of mortality.\nMETHODS: Between October, 2001, and December, 2004, patients with AD who resided in care facilities in the UK were enrolled into a randomised, placebo-controlled, parallel, two-group treatment discontinuation trial. Participants were randomly assigned to continue with their antipsychotic treatment (thioridazine, chlorpromazine, haloperidol, trifluoperazine, or risperidone) for 12 months or to switch their medication to an oral placebo. The primary outcome was mortality at 12 months. An additional follow-up telephone assessment was done to establish whether each participant was still alive 24 months after the enrollment of the last participant (range 24-54 months). Causes of death were obtained from death certificates. Analysis was by intention to treat (ITT) and modified intention to treat (mITT). This trial is registered with the Cochrane Central Registry of Controlled Trials\/National Research Register, number ISRCTN33368770.\nFINDINGS: 165 patients were randomised (83 to continue antipsychotic treatment and 82 to placebo), of whom 128 (78%) started treatment (64 continued with their treatment and 64 received placebo). There was a reduction in survival in the patients who continued to receive antipsychotics compared with those who received placebo. Cumulative probability of survival during the 12 months was 70% (95% CI 58-80%) in the continue treatment group versus 77% (64-85%) in the placebo group for the mITT population. Kaplan-Meier estimates of mortality for the whole study period showed a significantly increased risk of mortality for patients who were allocated to continue antipsychotic treatment compared with those allocated to placebo (mITT log rank p=0.03; ITT p=0.02). The hazard ratio for the mITT group was 0.58 (95% CI 0.35 to 0.95) and 0.58 (0.36 to 0.92) for the ITT population. The more pronounced differences between groups during periods of follow up longer than 12 months were evident at specific timepoints (24-month survival 46%vs 71%; 36-month survival 30%vs 59%).\nINTERPRETATION: There is an increased long-term risk of mortality in patients with AD who are prescribed antipsychotic medication; these results further highlight the need to seek less harmful alternatives for the long-term treatment of neuropsychiatric symptoms in these patients.\nFUNDING: UK Alzheimer's Research Trust.\n",

Seventy percent of the residents were women, and 42% had a documented diagnosis of dementia. An additional 5% had a psychotic disorder, and 7% had a diagnosis of depression.\nINTERVENTION: Experimental homes participated in an outreach program that was designed to influence drug use through improved teamwork among physicians, pharmacists, nurses, and nurses' assistants. Multidisciplinary team meetings were held on a regular basis throughout the 12-month study period.\nMEASUREMENTS: Lists of each resident's prescriptions were collected 1 month before and 1 month after the 12-month intervention. Measures included the proportion of residents with any psychotropic drug, polymedicine, and therapeutic duplication and proportion of residents with nonrecommended and acceptable drugs in each psychotropic drug class, as defined by current Swedish guidelines.\nRESULTS: Baseline results show extensive psychotropic drug prescribing, with the most commonly prescribed drugs being hypnotics (40%), anxiolytics (40%), and antipsychotics (38%). After 12 months of team meetings in the experimental homes, there was a significant decrease in the prescribing of psychotics (-19%), benzodiazepine hypnotics (-37%), and antidepressants (-59%). Orders for more acceptable antidepressants also increased in the experimental homes. In the control homes there was increased use of acceptable antidepressants, but there were no significant reductions in other drug classes.\nCONCLUSIONS: There is excessive prescription of psychotropic drugs in Swedish nursing homes. Improved teamwork among caregivers can improve prescribing as defined by clinical guidelines.\n",

        "Abstract":"Post hoc analyses of pooled results from 11 randomised controlled trials of risperidone and olanzapine in elderly dementia subjects revealed an increased incidence of cerebrovascular adverse events compared with placebo. Reanalysis of the risperidone trials suggests that some of the increased incidence may be accounted for by nonspecific events that were not strokes. Large observational administrative health database studies appear to confirm that risperidone and olanzapine are not associated with an increased risk of stroke in elderly patients compared with typical antipsychotics or untreated dementia patients. A larger number of subjects with vascular and mixed dementias were included in the risperidone studies compared with the olanzapine studies, which likely accounts for the increased incidence of cerebrovascular adverse events in the risperidone trials compared with the olanzapine studies. Potential mechanisms proposed to explain an association between atypical antipsychotics and cerebrovascular adverse events include thromboembolic effects, cardiovascular effects (e.g. orthostatic hypotension, arrhythmias), excessive sedation resulting in dehydration and haemoconcentration, and hyperprolactinaemia. However, there is little evidence to support these hypothesised mechanisms at present. The association between atypical antipsychotics and cerebrovascular adverse events requires further clarification. At the present time, this association is another factor that clinicians should consider when weighing the risks and benefits of treating behavioural and psychological disturbances in elderly dementia patients.

One placebo-controlled trial, two new meta-analyses, and several cohort studies of various sizes and designs have been published since 2005. The double-blind placebo-controlled trial showed a statistically significant decline in mortality when neuroleptic therapy (risperidone or haloperidol in most cases) was withdrawn. One of the meta-analyses showed excess mortality in patients receiving atypical neuroleptics compared with those not receiving neuroleptics. The other meta-analysis, focusing solely on risperidone, showed a higher risk of vascular death than in placebo-treated patients. Four very large cohort studies also showed a trend towards excess mortality with conventional neuroleptics. In practice, as all neuroleptics have negative risk-benefit balances in elderly dementia patients, it is best to avoid using them in these patients, if possible. If a neuroleptic is nonetheless prescribed, treatment should be for the shortest possible duration, at the minimum effective dose.\n",

The subjects were 58 out-patients with dementia and agitation. After baseline assessments and, if necessary, a period of wash-out of a previous antipsychotic drug, they were randomly assigned to 5 weeks of double-blind treatment with either olanzapine or haloperidol. The first 2 weeks were used for dose titration. Subsequently, the patients received a fixed dose of either olanzapine (average dose 4.71 mg) or haloperidol (average dose 1.75 mg) from day 14 to day 35. Both olanzapine and haloperidol decreased agitation significantly (decrease in Cohen-Mansfield Agitation Inventory scores), but there was no significant difference between the two drugs. The two drugs had comparable effects on all secondary outcome measures. They were well tolerated and had a similar side-effect pattern.

Forced-choice guesses of whether patients had been receiving active or placebo medication were made in a clinical trial. Correctness of guessing was correlated with measures of Parkinsonism. Raters' guesses were better than chance expectation and correlated with ratings of Parkinsonism. Nurses' guesses correlated with their own global measure of side effects but not with raters' measures. Patients' guesses were no better than chance. Unblinding of raters is a significant factor in anticholinergic withdrawal studies and preconceived notions of the value of anticholinergics could therefore be affecting the results of trials, helping to produce the wide variation in relapse rates.\n",

        "Abstract":"BACKGROUND: Relations between pretreatment symptom ratings and ECT outcome were examined in acute manic patients admitted at a state psychiatric center who were nonresponsive to medication.\nMETHOD: One or 2 days after undergoing pretreatment clinical ratings, patients were randomly assigned to intensive pharmacotherapy, right unilateral ECT, left unilateral ECT, or bilateral ECT. Patients who failed to respond to any of the first three treatment conditions were assigned to crossover bilateral ECT. Patients who failed to respond to a primary treatment condition other than bilateral ECT but refused crossover bilateral ECT and those in whom ECT was terminated due to an organic brain syndrome were not considered for this study. No psychotropic drugs were prescribed for 4-7 days before, or during, the course of ECT. Of the 24 patients who entered the study, 18 patients completed the protocol. Based on independent clinical assessments by two research psychiatrists, a favorable treatment response was defined as a complete recovery from manic episode that was sustained for 1 week during which no psychotropic medications were prescribed.\nRESULTS: ECT nonresponders were significantly more angry, irritable, and suspicious than ECT responders. Severity of mania and depression ratings at baseline were not related to ECT response.\nCONCLUSION: Symptoms associated with poor response to ECT may overlap with those that have been reported to predict nonresponse to treatment with lithium. Our evidence also may support the view that differential symptom patterns may predict treatment outcomes to ECT and carbamazepine, respectively, in manic patients who do not respond to treatment with lithium or neuroleptics.\n",

The aripiprazole starting dose was 2 mg\/day, and could be titrated to higher doses (5, 10, and 15 mg\/day) based on efficacy and tolerability.\nRESULTS: No significant differences in mean change [2 x SD] from baseline between aripiprazole (mean dose approximately 9 mg\/day at endpoint; range = 0.7-15.0 mg) and placebo were detected in the coprimary efficacy endpoints of Neuropsychiatric Inventory-Nursing Home Version (NPI-NH) Psychosis score (aripiprazole, -4.53 [9.23]; placebo, -4.62 [9.56]; F = 0.02, df = 1, 222, p = 0.883 [ANCOVA]) and Clinical Global Impression (CGI)-Severity score (aripiprazole, -0.57 [1.63]; placebo, -0.43 [1.65]; F = 1.67, df = 1, 220, p = 0.198 [ANCOVA]) at endpoint. However, improvements in several secondary efficacy measures (NPI-NH Total, Brief Psychiatric Rating Scale Total, CGI - improvement, Cohen-Mansfield Agitation Inventory and Cornell Depression Scale scores) indicated that aripiprazole may confer clinical benefits beyond the primary outcome measures. Treatment-emergent adverse events (AEs) were similar in both groups, except for somnolence (aripiprazole, 14%; placebo, 4%). Somnolence with aripiprazole was of mild or moderate intensity, and not associated with accidental injury. Incidence of AEs related to extrapyramidal symptoms was low with aripiprazole (5%) and placebo (4%).\nCONCLUSIONS: In nursing home residents with AD and psychosis, aripiprazole did not confer specific benefits for the treatment of psychotic symptoms; but psychological and behavioral symptoms, including agitation, anxiety, and depression, were improved with aripiprazole, with a low risk of AEs.\n",

        "Abstract":"OBJECTIVES: Several previous studies have examined the effects of pharmacological interventions for agitated behavior in patients with dementia. However, the choice of medication in clinical practice continues to be directed largely by local pharmacotherapy culture rather than empirical treatment guidelines. We examined the relationship between behavioral improvement and co-occurring delusions and mood symptoms in patients with dementia who were treated with haloperidol, an antipsychotic medication, or trazodone, a serotonergic antidepressant.\nDESIGN: Randomized, double-blind, parallel-group, 9-week treatment trial.\nSETTING: Inpatient geropsychiatry unit.\nPARTICIPANTS: Twenty-eight patients with dementia and agitated or aggressive behaviors.\nINTERVENTION: Haloperidol 1 to 5 mg\/day or trazodone 50 to 250 mg\/day.\nMEASUREMENTS: Cohen-Mansfield Agitation Inventory (CMAI), Hamilton Depression Rating Scale (Ham-D), and delusional thoughts subscale and hallucinations subscale of the Behavioral Pathology in Alzheimer's Disease Rating Scale (BEHAVE-AD).\nRESULTS: CMAI scores improved in each treatment group over the 9 weeks of treatment (P < .001 in each group). Within the haloperidol treatment group, CMAI improvement was not associated with baseline delusional thoughts score or with change in delusional thoughts score over the course of treatment. Within the trazodone treatment group, CMAI improvement was associated with baseline score on total Ham-D (r = -0.60, P = .02), Ham-D items measuring subjective mood symptoms (r = -0.50, P = .07), and Ham-D items measuring neurovegetative signs (r = -0.49, P = .08). CMAI improvement was also associated with improvement in Ham-D total score over the course of treatment (r = 0.62, P = .02).\nCONCLUSIONS: Mild depressive symptoms in patients with dementia and agitated behavior are associated with greater behavioral improvement by trazodone-treated patients. In contrast, the presence of delusions in concert with behavioral disturbance does not necessarily predict greater behavioral improvement with haloperidol treatment than in subjects without signs of psychosis.\n",

This study was conducted to assess the efficacy and safety of olanzapine in treating psychosis and\/or agitation\/aggression in patients with AD.\nMETHODS: A multicenter, double-blind, placebo-controlled, 6-week study was conducted in 206 elderly US nursing home residents with AD who exhibited psychotic and\/or behavioral symptoms. Patients were randomly assigned to placebo or a fixed dose of 5, 10, or 15 mg\/d of olanzapine. The primary efficacy measure was the sum of the Agitation\/Aggression, Hallucinations, and Delusions items (Core Total) of the Neuropsychiatric Inventory-Nursing Home version.\nRESULTS: Low-dose olanzapine (5 and 10 mg\/d) produced significant improvement compared with placebo on the Core Total (-7.6 vs -3.7 [P<.001] and -6.1 vs -3. 7 [P =.006], respectively). Core Total improvement with olanzapine, 15 mg\/d, was not significantly greater than placebo. The Occupational Disruptiveness score, reflecting the impact of patients' psychosis and behavioral disturbances on the caregiver, was significantly reduced in the 5-mg\/d olanzapine group compared with placebo (-2.7 vs -1.5; P =.008). Somnolence was significantly more common among patients receiving olanzapine (25.0%-35.8%), and gait disturbance occurred in those receiving 5 or 15 mg\/d (19.6% and 17.0%, respectively). No significant cognitive impairment, increase in extrapyramidal symptoms, or central anticholinergic effects were found at any olanzapine dose relative to placebo.\nCONCLUSION: Low-dose olanzapine (5 and 10 mg\/d) was significantly superior to placebo and well tolerated in treating agitation\/aggression and psychosis in this population of patients with AD.\n",

        "Abstract":"This paper reviews the main neurological complications of psychiatric drugs, in particular antipsychotics and antidepressants. Extrapyramidal syndromes include acute dystonia, parkinsonism, akathisia, tardive dyskinesia and tardive dystonia. Extrapyramidal symptoms (EPS) are less frequent with atypical than with conventional antipsychotics but remain common in clinical practice partly due to lack of screening by health professionals. Neuroleptic malignant syndrome (NMS) consists of severe muscle rigidity, pyrexia, change in conscious level and autonomic disturbance but partial forms also occur. NMS is particularly associated with the initiation and rapid increase in dose of high-potency antipsychotics but it has been reported with all the atypical antipsychotics and rarely with other drugs including antidepressants. Serotonin toxicity comprises altered mental state (agitation, excitement, confusion), neuromuscular hyperactivity (tremor, clonus, myoclonus, hyper-reflexia) and autonomic hyperactivity and occurs on a spectrum. Severe cases, termed serotonin syndrome, usually follow the co-prescription of drugs that increase serotonergic transmission by different pathways, for example a monoamine oxidase inhibitor (MAOI) and a selective serotonin reuptake inhibitor (SSRI). Most antipsychotics and antidepressants lower the seizure threshold and can cause seizures; the risk is greater with clozapine than with other atypical antipsychotics and greater with tricyclic antidepressants (TCAs) than with SSRIs. In randomised controlled trials in elderly patients with dementia atypical antipsychotics are associated with a higher risk of stroke and death than placebo. Cohort studies suggest that conventional drugs carry at least the same risk. Cessation of treatment with antipsychotics and antidepressants can lead to a wide range of discontinuation symptoms which include movement disorders and other neurological symptoms. Clinicians need to be familiar with strategies to reduce the risk of these adverse events and to manage them when they arise. Their occurrence needs to be balanced against the benefits of psychiatric drugs in terms of efficacy and improved quality of life in a range of disorders. Copyright (c) 2007 John Wiley & Sons, Ltd.

        "Abstract":"BACKGROUND: The majority of patients with Alzheimer's disease (AD) or vascular dementia display, in addition to cognitive impairment, various degrees of behavioral disturbances. As the use of cholinesterase inhibitors for the treatment of cognitive impairment in dementia becomes widespread, many of these patients will be treated concomitantly with cholinesterase inhibitors and with anti-psychotic drugs to ameliorate behavioral disturbances. Despite the widespread use of this combination in clinical practice, the safety and tolerability of such combination therapy has not been evaluated in controlled clinical trials. This pilot study examined the effects of addition of risperidone 0.5-2 mg\/day to patients on rivastigmine 3-12 mg\/day, and vice versa.\nMETHODS: 65 patients suffering from AD, 10 from vascular dementia, and 15 from both were randomized to open label rivastigmine and risperidone, alone or in combination, for 20 weeks. Adverse events caused by co-administration were assessed.\nRESULTS: No clinically relevant adverse interactions were observed.\nCONCLUSIONS: These preliminary results indicate that rivastigmine and risperidone can be safely co-administered. Confirmation of these results in large clinical trials studies is warranted. Copyright 2002 John Wiley & Sons, Ltd.\n",

Subjects included 34 residents with dementia who were on antipsychotics for more than 6 months and whose behavior was currently stable. Subjects were randomized to either continue receiving their regular dosage of antipsychotics or to receive placebo for 6 months. Early withdrawal from the study was not statistically different between the groups (relative risk [RR] = 1.57, 95% confidence interval [CI] 0.76-3.26), and though not significantly different, subjects in the placebo group were more likely to be withdrawn from the study because of worsening behavior (RR = 1.25, 95% Cl 0.33-4.76). Three subjects in the placebo group were withdrawn from the study due to worsening of extrapyramidal symptoms. The active treatment group had more behavioral problems (e.g., physical aggression towards others, p < .05) compared to the placebo group. The placebo group developed more apathy, but balancing this outcome was a relative improvement in cognitive functioning. Baseline antipsychotic dose was predictive of behavioral worsening upon discontinuation of long-term antipsychotic drugs. The primary limitation of the study was the small sample size.

The aim of this study was to determine the impact of long-term treatment with neuroleptic agents upon global cognitive decline and neuropsychiatric symptoms in patients with Alzheimer disease.\nMETHODS AND FINDINGS:\nDESIGN: Randomised, blinded, placebo-controlled parallel two-group treatment discontinuation trial.\nSETTING: Oxfordshire, Newcastle and Gateshead, London and Edinburgh, United Kingdom.\nPARTICIPANTS: Patients currently prescribed the neuroleptics thioridazine, chlorpromazine, haloperidol trifluoperazine or risperidone for behavioural or psychiatric disturbance in dementia for at least 3 mo.\nINTERVENTIONS: Continue neuroleptic treatment for 12 mo or switch to an identical placebo.\nOUTCOME MEASURES: Primary outcome was total Severe Impairment Battery (SIB) score. Neuropsychiatric symptoms were evaluated with the Neuropsychiatric Inventory (NPI).\nRESULTS: 165 patients were randomised (83 to continue treatment and 82 to placebo, i.e., discontinue treatment), of whom 128 (78%) commenced treatment (64 continue\/64 placebo). Of those, 26 were lost to follow-up (13 per arm), resulting in 51 patients per arm analysed for the primary outcome. There was no significant difference between the continue treatment and placebo groups in the estimated mean change in SIB scores between baseline and 6 mo; estimated mean difference in deterioration (favouring placebo) -0.4 (95% confidence interval [CI] -6.4 to 5.5), adjusted for baseline value (p = 0.9). For neuropsychiatric symptoms, there was no significant difference between the continue treatment and placebo groups (n = 56 and 53, respectively) in the estimated mean change in NPI scores between baseline and 6 mo; estimated mean difference in deterioration (favouring continue treatment) -2.4 (95% CI -8.2 to 3.5), adjusted for baseline value (p = 0.4). Both results became more pronounced at 12 mo. There was some evidence to suggest that those patients with initial NPI >\/= 15 benefited on neuropsychiatric symptoms from continuing treatment.\nCONCLUSIONS: For most patients with AD, withdrawal of neuroleptics had no overall detrimental effect on functional and cognitive status. Neuroleptics may have some value in the maintenance treatment of more severe neuropsychiatric symptoms, but this benefit must be weighed against the side effects of therapy.\nTRIAL REGISTRATION: Cochrane Central Registry of Controlled Trials\/National Research Register (#ISRCTN33368770).\n",

The efficacy data (risperidone n=722, placebo n=428) were obtained from the Cohen-Mansfield agitation inventory (CMAI) and behavioral pathology in Alzheimer's disease (BEHAVE-AD) total and subscales. Additionally, clinical global impression (CGI) assessments were performed. Subgroup analyses were performed by type of dementia, severity of dementia, presence or absence of somnolence as an adverse event, and presence or absence of psychosis at baseline. Safety assessments included evaluation of treatment emergent adverse events, Extrapyramidal Symptom Rating Scale, ECG and vital signs, and Mini-Mental State Examination (MMSE). The mean dose of risperidone at end point was 1.0 mg\/day (0.02 S.E.). The observed mean change at end point was significantly higher for risperidone than for placebo on CMAI total score (-11.8 versus -6.4, respectively; p<0.001), total aggression score (-5.0 versus -1.8, respectively; p<0.001), BEHAVE-AD total score (-6.1 and -3.6, respectively; p<0.001), and psychotic symptoms score (-2.1 and -1.3, respectively; p=0.003).

More patients discontinued due to adverse events in the risperidone-treated group (17.2%) than in the placebo group (11.2%). Differences in adverse event incidences between placebo and risperidone were observed for extrapyramidal symptoms (EPS), mild somnolence and the less common cerebrovascular adverse events (CAE). Risperidone induced neither orthostatic, nor anticholinergic side effects nor falls nor cognitive decline. Of all atypical antipsychotics, risperidone has the largest database of double-blind controlled trials to support its efficacy and safety in the treatment of agitation, aggression, and psychosis associated with dementia. At the recommended doses, risperidone displayed a favorable risk-benefit profile. Risperidone was well tolerated with respect to EPS, somnolence, and anticholinergic side effects in this elderly population. In view of the risk for CAEs, risperidone, should be targeted towards the treatment of those patients in whom psychotic and behavioral symptoms of dementia are prominent and associated with significant distress, functional impairment or danger to the patient.\n",

        "Abstract":"BACKGROUND: Despite modest efficacy, unpredictable individual utility, and a high rate of adverse effects, behavioural and psychological symptoms of dementia (BPSD) are common determinants for antipsychotic drug therapy in nursing home patients.\nAIMS: To explore the impact on BPSD of stopping long-term antipsychotic treatment in nursing home patients with dementia.\nMETHODS: Fifty-five patients (43 women; mean age 84.1) taking haloperidol, risperidone, or olanzapine for BPSD were randomly assigned to cessation (intervention group, n=27) or continued treatment with antipsychotic drugs (reference group, n=28) for 4 consecutive weeks. The Neuropsychiatric Inventory (NPI) Questionnaire was used to examine changes in behavioural and psychological symptoms.\nRESULTS: By study completion, 23 of the 27 intervention group patients were still off antipsychotics. Symptom scores (NPI) remained stable or even improved in 42 patients (intervention group, 18 out of 27; reference group, 24 out of 28; p=0.18). As compared to patients with stable or improved symptom scores, patients with behavioural deterioration after antipsychotic cessation used higher daily drug doses at baseline (p=0.42).\nCONCLUSION: A large share of elderly nursing home patients on long-term treatment with antipsychotics for BPSD, do well without this treatment. Standardized symptom evaluations and drug cessation attempts should therefore be undertaken at regular intervals.\n",

        "Abstract":"BACKGROUND: Medications are frequently prescribed for neuropsychiatric symptoms (NPS) associated with dementia, although information on the efficacy and safety of medications for NPS specifically in long-term care (LTC) settings is limited. The objective of this study was to provide a current review of the efficacy and safety of pharmacological treatments for NPS in LTC.\nMETHODS: We searched MEDLINE, EMBASE, PsychINFO, and the Cochrane Library for randomized controlled trials comparing medications with either placebo or other interventions in LTC. Study quality was described using the Cochrane collaboration risk of bias tool. The efficacy of medications was evaluated using NPS symptom rating scales. Safety was evaluated through rates of trial withdrawals, trial withdrawals due to adverse events, and mortality.\nRESULTS: A total of 29 studies met inclusion criteria. The most common medications evaluated in studies were atypical antipsychotics (N = 15), typical antipsychotics (N = 7), anticonvulsants (N = 4), and cholinesterase inhibitors (N = 3). Statistically significant improvements in NPS were noted in some studies evaluating risperidone, olanzapine, and single studies of aripiprazole, carbamazepine, estrogen, cyproterone, propranolol, and prazosin. Study quality was difficult to rate in many cases due to incomplete reporting of details. Some studies reported higher rates of trial withdrawals, adverse events, and mortality associated with medications.\nCONCLUSIONS: We conclude that there is limited evidence to support the use of some atypical antipsychotics and other medications for NPS in LTC populations. However, the generally modest efficacy and risks of adverse events highlight the need for the development of safe and effective pharmacological and non-pharmacological interventions for this population.\n",

        "Abstract":"INTRODUCTION: Even though cognitive impairment is manifested in almost all patients with schizophrenia, the Clinical Antipsychotic Trials for Intervention Effectiveness (CATIE) study showed no significant difference between first- and second-generation psychotropic drugs in improving cognitive abilities. Discovering new drugs that can improve impaired cognition, thus, is an attractive treatment target for patients with schizophrenia.\nAREAS COVERED: This article briefly reviews about donepezil, a highly selective (IC(50) = 6.7 nM) centrally acting reversible acetylcholinesterase inhibitor that has been approved by FDA for treating cognitive deficit states such as in Alzheimer's disease and its uses in clinical trials for the treatment of schizophrenia. The literature search included PubMed and Cochrane library with the following words: donepezil, schizophrenia and cognitive impairments.\nEXPERT OPINION: The results of several clinical trials utilizing donepezil as an adjunct to second-generation antipsychotic drugs targeting cognitive deficits in schizophrenia subjects have been disappointing and would not lead clinicians to consider this as a potential treatment option. While longer randomized controlled trials, increase dosage and selected groups of patients at different stage of cognitive impairment may provide a better understanding of the potential for this drug in addressing cognitive deficits, results to date have not been encouraging.\n",

        "Abstract":"BACKGROUND: Almost all of the 820,000 people in the UK with dementia will experience Behavioural and Psychological Symptoms of Dementia (BPSD). However, research has traditionally focused on treating cognitive symptoms, thus neglecting core clinical symptoms that often have a more profound impact on living with dementia. Recent evidence (Kales et al, 2007; Ballard et al, 2009) indicates that the popular approach to managing BPSD - prescription of anti-psychotic medication - can increase mortality and the risk of stroke in people with dementia as well as impair quality of life and accelerate cognitive decline. Consequently, there is a need to evaluate the impact that non-pharmacological interventions have on BPSD; we believe physical exercise is a particularly promising approach.\nMETHODS\/DESIGN: We will carry out a pragmatic, randomised, single-blind controlled trial to evaluate the effectiveness of exercise (planned walking) on the behavioural and psychological symptoms of individuals with dementia. We aim to recruit 146 people with dementia and their carers to be randomized into two groups; one will be trained in a structured, tailored walking programme, while the other will continue with treatment as usual. The primary outcome (BPSD) will be assessed with the Neuropsychiatric Inventory (NPI) along with relevant secondary outcomes at baseline, 6 and 12 weeks.\nDISCUSSION: Designing this study has been challenging both ethically and methodologically. In particular to design an intervention that is simple, measurable, safe, non-invasive and enjoyable has been testing and has required a lot of thought. Throughout the design, we have attempted to balance methodological rigour with study feasibility. We will discuss the challenges that were faced and overcome in this paper.\nTRIAL REGISTRATION: ISRCTN01423159.\n",

        "Abstract":"OBJECTIVE: To summarize the US Food and Drug Administration's (FDA's) review of the safety and effectiveness for pimavanserin, an atypical antipsychotic, for the treatment of hallucinations and delusions associated with Parkinson's disease psychosis. We describe the regulatory and clinical issues important to the FDA's approval of this New Drug Application, with special focus on the risk-benefit balance. We also describe a new labeling feature that presents additional efficacy data to clinicians.\nDATA SOURCES: Data sets for all relevant clinical trials of pimavanserin and the Applicant's and FDA's analyses of these data were considered in this review. Data were available from 616 patients with Parkinson's disease with hallucinations and delusions who received at least 1 dose of pimavanserin, with a total exposure of 825 patient-years in the Parkinson's disease psychosis population.\nRESULTS: Pimavanserin 34 mg\/d was effective in treating hallucinations and delusions associated with Parkinson's disease. In the Applicant's single pivotal trial, 80.5% of pimavanserin patients experienced at least some improvement in symptoms compared to 58.1% of patients taking placebo. Pimavanserin did not worsen motor function, an adverse effect commonly observed with other antipsychotics, probably because of a lack of consequential dopamine binding.\nCONCLUSIONS: Pimavanserin is the only FDA-approved treatment for the hallucinations and delusions seen in patients with psychosis of Parkinson's disease. Although pimavanserin appears to have a pharmacologic mechanism that is different from other atypical antipsychotics, concern remained that the increased risk of death seen with antipsychotic use in elderly demented patients, and described in all approved antipsychotic labels, would also occur with pimavanserin. Pimavanserin bears the same boxed warning about the risk of death associated with antipsychotic use in elderly patients with dementia. © Copyright 2017 Physicians Postgraduate Press, Inc.\n",

        "Abstract":"The management of frontotemporal dementia (FTD), a disorder characterized by varied behavioral symptoms, primarily involves the use of psychoactive medications. Although there are no approved treatments for the disorder, selective serontonin receptor inhibitors, such as sertraline, paroxetine, or fluoxetine, can decrease disinhibition-impulsivity, repetitive behaviors, and eating disorders in FTD. Low doses of trazodone or an atypical antipsychotic such as aripriprazole can also help manage significantly disturbed or agitated behavior. The acetylcholinesterase inhibitors used for patients with Alzheimer's disease have not had significant efficacy for patients with FTD, but memantine, another dementia medication, is under investigation for the treatment of this disorder. In addition to drug therapy, the nonpharmacological management of patients with FTD focuses on education, behavioral interventions, and care of the caregivers. Most recently, investigators have initiated steps toward rational drug therapy with the development of outcome measures for clinical drug trials in FTD and the characterization of treatment targets such tau protein or the TAR DNA-binding protein 43. This approach holds great promise for an eventual treatment for this devastating early-onset dementia. Copyright (c) 2009 S. Karger AG, Basel. [References: 55]\n",

Although a variety of therapeutics targeting amyloid production or plaque degradation as well as tau hyperphosphorylation and aggregation have been proposed, examined in pre-clinical models and introduced into clinical trials, many have failed to provide significant therapeutic benefit. Concerns over the adequacy of currently used pre-clinical models, in addition to questions pertaining to the timing of therapeutic administration, vis-a-vis synaptic and neuronal loss have been raised, and are further complicated by the genetic diversity of individual patients.

Chlorpromazine was found to be significantly better than remoxipride on the dropout rate due to inefficacy, Clinical Global Impression (CGI) of severity of illness and Brief Psychiatric Rating Scale (BPRS). Chlorpromazine tended to be better than placebo on the dropout rate related to inefficacy, Nurse's Global Impression (NGI) of severity and on the BPRS measures of positive symptoms (hallucinatory behaviour and thinking disturbance factor). We were unable to detect a difference between remoxipride and placebo except that remoxipride was better in patients who had previously responded well to neuroleptics. Both drugs induced significantly more parkinsonism than placebo, but differently so: chlorpromazine induced both types of parkinsonism hypo- and hyper-kinetic symptoms, whereas remoxipride induced hyperkinetic symptoms. Chlorpromazine caused more tachycardia, drowsiness, orthostatic dizziness, and dry mouth than the other two treatments, while patients on remoxipride suffered more from insomnia than those on the other two treatments.\n",

Risperidone (6 to 16 mg)-treated patients showed significantly (p < 0.05) lower dyskinetic scores than those receiving placebo, whereas in haloperidol- and placebo-treated patients, no significant differences for dyskinetic symptoms were noted. To explore the antidyskinetic effect of risperidone, a post hoc analysis was performed on two selected patient samples: (1) patients meeting Research Diagnosis Criteria (RDC) for tardive dyskinesia (TD) at baseline or during double-blind treatment (N = 49) and (2) patients with RDC TD and with a Clinical Global Impression (CGI) Severity of dyskinesia score > or = 5 (at least moderately severe) (N = 48). The composition of the two subsamples was found to be almost identical because all but one of the patients with RDC TD (N = 49) were members of the group with at least moderately severe TD (N = 48). Analysis of four parameters (Extrapyramidal Symptom Rating Scale-dyskinesia total score, CGI severity of dyskinesia, buccolinguomasticatory [BLM] factor score, and extremities [choreoathetoid factor] score confirmed the antidyskinetic effect that was noted in the intent-to-treat analysis, which included all patients, whether they had RDC TD or not. Results indicated that risperidone at 6 mg\/day had the most beneficial effect on TD, especially on the BLM syndrome, without inducing significant parkinsonism while treating psychotic symptoms.

There were 764 cases of hip fracture identified; up to 5 controls, matched to cases on NH and quarter of Minimum Data Set (MDS) assessment, were randomly selected from the source population (N=3582).\nMEASUREMENTS: Cases of hip fracture were identified and medication use was ascertained from Medicaid claims data. Resident-level characteristics, including dementia severity, were obtained from resident MDS assessments.\nRESULTS: Current use of APs conveyed a small increased risk of hip fracture (adjusted odds ratio=1.26; 95% confidence interval: 1.05 -1.52). When analyzed separately, users of conventional antipsychotics had a slightly higher risk of hip fracture than residents on atypical agents. Long-term use of APs conferred a greater risk of hip fracture than short-term use.\nCONCLUSION: APs appear to increase the risk of hip fracture among older adults with dementia residing in an NH. Hip fractures may be a contributory mechanism to the increased risk mortality observed among AP users. Copyright 2010 American Medical Directors Association. Published by Elsevier Inc.

        "Abstract":"Due to the stochastic nature of radioactive decay, any measurement of radioactivity concentration requires spatial averaging. In pharmacokinetic analysis of time-activity curves (TAC), such averaging over heterogeneous tissues may introduce a systematic error (heterogeneity error) but may also improve the accuracy and precision of parameter estimation. In addition to spatial averaging (inevitable due to limited scanner resolution and intended in ROI analysis), interindividual averaging may theoretically be beneficial, too. The aim of this study was to investigate the effect of such averaging on the binding potential ( BP) calculated with Logan's non-invasive graphical analysis and the \"simplified reference tissue method\" (SRTM) proposed by Lammertsma and Hume, on the basis of simulated and measured positron emission tomography data [[(11)C] d- threo-methylphenidate (dMP) and [(11)C]raclopride (RAC) PET]. dMP was not quantified with SRTM since the low k(2) (washout rate constant from the first tissue compartment) introduced a high noise sensitivity. Even for considerably different shapes of TAC (dMP PET in parkinsonian patients and healthy controls, [(11)C]raclopride in patients with and without haloperidol medication) and a high variance in the rate constants (e.g. simulated standard deviation of K(1)=25%), the BP obtained from average TAC was close to the mean BP (error <5%). However, unfavourably distributed parameters, especially a correlated large variance in two or more parameters, may lead to larger errors. In Monte Carlo simulations, interindividual averaging before quantification reduced the variance from the SRTM (beyond a critical signal to noise ratio) and the bias in Logan's method. Interindividual averaging may further increase accuracy when there is an error term in the reference tissue assumption E= DV(2)- DV' ( DV(2) = distribution volume of the first tissue compartment, DV' = distribution volume of the reference tissue). This can be explained by the fact that the distribution volume ratio ( DVR= DV\/DV') obtained from averaged TAC is an approximation for Sigma DV\/Sigma DV' rather than for Sigma DVR\/ n. We conclude that Logan's non-invasive method and SRTM are suitable for heterogeneous tissues and that discussion of group differences in PET studies generally should include qualitative and quantitative assessment of interindividually averaged TAC.\n",

        "Abstract":"OBJECTIVES: To assess the long-term mortality risk associated with antipsychotic drug (AP) use in nursing homes.\nDESIGN: A longitudinal study with 5 assessments over a 75-month follow-up period.\nSETTING: A representative sample of nursing home patients in 4 Norwegian counties.\nPARTICIPANTS: At baseline, 1163 patients were included. At the last follow-up, 98 patients were still alive.\nMEASUREMENTS: Prevalent drug use at each assessment was registered. Level of dementia, neuropsychiatric symptoms, level of functioning, medical health, and use of restraints were recorded at each assessment. A Cox regression model with time-dependent psychotropic drug use as the main predictor was estimated and adjusted for confounders.\nRESULTS: In unadjusted Cox regression, a lower mortality risk was associated with the use of other psychotropic drugs, but not APs, compared with nonusers. In the adjusted analysis, neither use of APs nor other psychiatric drugs was associated with increased mortality risk. Higher age, male gender, not being married, medical disease burden, lower level of functioning, more severe degree of dementia, and a higher number of drugs were all associated with increased mortality risk.\nCONCLUSION: In this long-term study of nursing home patients, AP drug use was not associated with increased risk of mortality. This is in line with results from earlier studies of clinical samples, but contrasts with results from randomized controlled trials and registry-based studies. The findings should be interpreted with caution. Taking into account the modest benefit and high risk of adverse effects of AP drug use, nonpharmacological treatment remains the first-line treatment approach.

        "Abstract":"Serum perphenazine concentrations and early resolution of psychosis were examined to determine if blood level monitoring could be used to maximize drug efficacy while limiting extrapyramidal side effects (EPS). Sixty-six acutely psychotic inpatients were given perphenazine 0.5 mg\/kg\/day for 10 days, and their response was rated blind to blood level. Although 36 of 66 patients showed resolution of psychosis, neither perphenazine nor N-dealkylated perphenazine levels were related to global response or to Brief Psychiatric Rating Scale (BPRS) totals. Improvement in two individual BPRS items (hallucinations and conceptual disorganization) was related to serum perphenazine levels and suggestive of a lower therapeutic threshold of 0.8 ng\/mL. Perphenazine level was not correlated with EPS; but benztropine, given only if required for serious EPS, was more likely to be used when perphenazine levels were elevated. The data suggest that higher perphenazine levels were no more effective than moderate levels but that higher levels may be associated with increased EPS; the data also suggest that individual symptoms rather than global response were associated with a lower therapeutic perphenazine threshold.\n",

        "Abstract":"BACKGROUND: Costs of care are frequently included as secondary endpoint in Alzheimer clinical trials because payers demand evidence of the budgetary effects of novel therapies. Future clinical trial protocols can be optimized on the basis of the currently available data, including what are the key resources and how are they correlated to disease severity measures.\nMETHODS: Primary patient-level data from two 18 months clinical trials of a putative disease modifier in mild-to-moderate Alzheimer's disease (n = 2,744) were analyzed to identify key components of costs of care and their determinants in a clinical trial setting. Costs of care were assessed with the resource utilization in dementia Lite (RUD) instrument, which includes patient accommodation, informal care, community care, and hospitalizations. The contribution of each component to total costs of care and their correlation with one another and key disease severity measures (Alzheimer's Disease Assessment Scale--Cognitive Subscale, Mini-Mental State Examination, Clinical Dementia Rating-Sum of Boxes, Alzheimer's Disease Cooperative Study--Activities of Daily Living Inventory, and Neuropsychiatric Inventory Questionnaire) was explored.\nRESULTS: Informal care constituted 82% to 86% of the total costs of care over the 18-months trial and community care services and patient accommodation contributed 6% to 8% each. Informal care was positively correlated with hospitalizations but negatively to patient accommodation, indicating that these services are supplements. Informal care also had the strongest pair-wise correlation with key disease severity measures, suggesting a higher chance of identifying a treatment effect on this component. ADL-ability (Alzheimer's Disease Cooperative Study--Activities of Daily Living Inventory) was the strongest predictor of costs of care of all disease severity measures.\nCONCLUSIONS: Informal care is the most important component of costs of care in a mild-to-moderate Alzheimer clinical trial sample, and it is primarily driven by the ADL-ability of the patient. Investigators should focus on the assessment of this economic endpoint because a significant treatment effect on this resource is likely to also affect total costs of care.

The purpose of this study was to compare the efficacy and safety of zotepine and haloperidol in Taiwanese patients with schizophrenia.\nPATIENTS AND METHODS: Patients with positive symptoms (n = 70) were enrolled into this double-blind, randomized study. Each patient received either zotepine 150 mg\/day or haloperidol 9 mg\/day. The Positive and Negative Syndrome Scale (PANSS), Brief Psychiatric Rating Scale (BPRS), and Clinical Global Impression (CGI) were assessed on Days 0, 3, 7, 14, 28, and 42 after the start of treatment. Adverse events were recorded during the trial period. The analyses were carried out on an intent-to-treat basis with the last observation carried forward.\nRESULTS: In terms of the score reduction in the PANSS, BPRS, and CGI, all analyses indicated that there were no significant differences between the groups at the end of the trial. Patients who received zotepine had no acute dystonia and less severe parkinsonism (p < 0.05 or 0.10), but significantly more dizziness, body weight gain, and pulse rate increase.\nCONCLUSION: In this 6-week trial, zotepine at 150 mg\/day was as efficacious as haloperidol 9 mg\/day in the treatment of Taiwanese patients with schizophrenia. Zotepine treatment produced fewer extrapyramidal symptoms but had a greater frequency of sedative effects compared to haloperidol.\n",

        "Abstract":"Sudden cardiac death has become a significant clinical concern when prescribing antipsychotic drugs, especially to older people with dementia. Sudden death syndrome has been known for decades to occur in association with taking first-generation antipsychotic medications, but it has become more prominent recently due to safety reviews about the use of second-generation antipsychotic medications. In 2005, the United States Food and Drug Administration disseminated information about cardiac fatalities, which led to black box warnings in second-generation, antipsychotic, drug-prescribing literature about higher mortality when administering to elderly persons with dementia-related psychoses. In this population, treatment results in death rates of 4.5 percent, as compared to 2.6 percent in subjects taking a placebo. Actually, patients treated with both the first- and second-generation versions experienced an increased incidence of fatalities. Before utilizing these agents, a careful workup must be completed. The presence of a psychosis or mania should be the only conventional indication for prescribing first- and second-generation antipsychotic medications. Physicians should always evaluate patients for comorbid conditions, especially heart disease and metabolic abnormalities, and all currently used medications to assure a risk-to-benefit ratio favoring the application of an antipsychotic medication. An electrocardiogram is a part of the evaluation of the cardiac status and determines the base line QT interval. While prescribing these medications in elderly patients, physicians must provide individualized clinical, electrocardiographic, and pharmaceutical monitoring.\n",

Research in the field of Alzheimer's disease therapy has been partly successful in terms of developing symptomatic treatments, but also had several failures in terms of developing disease-modifying therapies. These successes and failures have led to a debate about the potential deficiencies in our understanding of the pathogenesis of Alzheimer's disease and potential pitfalls in diagnosis, choice of therapeutic targets, development of drug candidates, and design of clinical trials. Many clinical and experimental studies are ongoing, but we need to acknowledge that a single cure for Alzheimer's disease is unlikely to be found and that the approach to drug development for this disorder needs to be reconsidered. Preclinical research is constantly providing us with new information on pieces of the complex Alzheimer's disease puzzle, and an analysis of this information might reveal patterns of pharmacological interactions instead of single potential drug targets. Several promising randomized controlled trials are ongoing, and the increased collaboration between pharmaceutical companies, basic researchers, and clinical researchers has the potential to bring us closer to developing an optimum pharmaceutical approach for the treatment of Alzheimer's disease.\n",

        "Abstract":"Preclinical and clinical studies gave evidence that lithium could be useful in the treatment of Alzheimer's disease (AD). In experimental investigations, lithium induces brain-derived neurotrophic factor (BDNF). Recent studies have found a decrease of BDNF in the serum and brains of AD patients with potentially consecutive lack of neurotrophic support. We assessed the influence of a lithium treatment on BDNF serum concentration in a subset of a greater sample recruited for a randomized, single-blinded, placebo-controlled, parallel-group multicenter 10-week study, investigating the efficacy of lithium treatment in AD patients. In AD patients treated with lithium, a significant increase of BDNF serum levels, and additionally a significant decrease of ADAS-Cog sum scores in comparison to placebo-treated patients, were found. Diminution of cognitive impairment was inversely correlated with lithium serum concentration. Upregulation of BDNF might be part of a neuroprotective effect of lithium in AD patients. The results of the present investigation encourage performing studies with longer treatment phases to observe potential positive long-term effects of lithium in AD patients.\n",

        "Abstract":"OPINION STATEMENT: There are currently no disease-modifying treatments for progressive supranuclear palsy (PSP) or corticobasal degeneration (CBD), and no approved pharmacological or therapeutic treatments that are effective in controlling their symptoms. The use of most pharmacological treatment options are based on experience in other disorders or from non-randomized historical controls, case series, or expert opinion. Levodopa may provide some improvement in symptoms of Parkinsonism (specifically bradykinesia and rigidity) in PSP and CBD; however, evidence is conflicting and where present, benefits are often negligible and short lived. In fact, \"poor\" response to levodopa forms part of the NINDS-SPSP criteria for the diagnosis of PSP and consensus criteria for the diagnosis of CBD (Lang Mov Disord. 20 Suppl 1:S83-91, 2005; Litvan et al. Neurology. 48:119-25, 1997; Armstrong et al. Neurology. 80(5):496-503, 2013). There is some evidence that intrasalivery gland botulinum toxin is useful in managing problematic sialorrhea and that intramuscular botulinum toxin and baclofen are helpful in reducing dystonia, including blepharospasm. Benzodiazepines may also be useful in managing dystonia. Myoclonus may be managed using levetiracetam and benzodiazepines. Pharmacological agents licensed for Alzheimer's disease (such as acetylcholinesterase inhibitors and N-Methyl-D-aspartate receptor antagonists) have been used off-label in PSP, CBD, and other tauopathies with the aim of improving cognition; however, there is limited evidence that they are effective and risk of adverse effects may outweigh benefits. The use of atypical antipsychotics for behavioural symptoms is not recommended in the elderly or those with demetia associated conditions and most antipsychotics will worsen Parkinsonism. Antidepressants may be useful for behavioral symptoms and depression but are often poorly tolerated due to adverse effects. In the absence of an effective drug treatment to target the underlying cause of CBD and PSP, management should focus on optimizing quality of life, relieving symptoms and assisting patients with their activities of daily living (ADL). Patients should be managed by a multidisciplinary team consisting of neurologists, physiotherapists (PT), occupational therapists (OT), speech and language therapists (SALT), dieticians, ophthalmologists, psychologists, and palliative care specialists.\n",

The literature suggests an association between acute motor side effects and tardive dyskinesia (TD); therefore, we hypothesized that low dose levels of risperidone will spare TD. As clinical studies of TD liability with fixed doses of risperidone are difficult to conduct, we tested low and high doses of risperidone in a rodent model of TD, vacuous chewing movements (VCMs) production. Low doses of risperidone (1.5 mg\/kg\/day) resulted in control levels of VCMs after 6 months of treatment, whereas high doses of risperidone (6 mg\/kg\/day) produced VCM in the same range as haloperidol. Plasma drug levels are reported. If this animal model predicts TD risk in humans, the TD liability with low-dose risperidone is at a placebo level, whereas higher doses show haloperidol-like TD risk, as predicted from the acute motor effects.\n",

This study was conducted to investigate the efficacy and tolerability of zotepine compared to haloperidol in combination with a mood stabilizer (lithium or valproate) for treatment of acute mania.\nMETHODS: This was a multi-center, randomized, rater-blinded, parallel-group, flexible-dose study. Forty-five hospitalized patients with moderate-to-severe manic, bipolar disorder (DSM-IV) were randomly assigned to a zotepine or a haloperidol 4-week treatment group.\nRESULTS: There was no significant between-group difference in the Young Mania Rating Scale total scores between the zotepine and haloperidol groups (-23.7 + or - 12.1 vs -22.3 + or - 11.0, respectively). The adverse events in both groups were mild to moderate. The haloperidol group reported a higher incidence of treatment-related adverse events, especially parkinsonism and akathisia, compared to the zotepine group. Serum uric acid decreased more in the zotepine group than in the haloperidol group.\nCONCLUSION: In combination with a mood stabilizer, zotepine appears to be as effective as haloperidol in treating moderate-to-severe mania in the acute phase, but has the advantages of lowering hyperuricemia and fewer extrapyramidal side-effects. Double-blinded studies with larger sample sizes are warranted to confirm these findings.\n",

        "Abstract":"Evidence linking schizophrenia to alterations in presynaptic dopamine (DA) grows, although treatments to date have largely focused on postsynaptic D2 receptor blockade. This study examined augmenting response in treatment-resistant schizophrenia through the addition of tetrabenazine (TBZ), a presynaptic vesicular monoamine transporter (VMAT2) inhibitor. Participants included 41 outpatients (mean age, 43.5 years) with treatment-refractory schizophrenia, stabilized on their present antipsychotic treatment (clozapine, 73%) for more than 3 months. Individuals were randomly assigned to TBZ augmentation (12.5-75 mg\/d), titrated according to a fixed, flexible schedule, or placebo over 12 weeks. Twenty subjects received TBZ, and 21 received placebo; doses of 18 of the 20 TBZ-treated individuals were titrated up to the maximum of 75 mg\/d, and 16 (80%) of them completed the trial. Tetrabenazine was well tolerated and not linked to increased adverse effects, including those that have been reported more frequently (eg, parkinsonism, depression, and sedation) with higher doses (>100 mg\/d) used in the treatment of hyperkinetic movement disorders. However, there was no indication of clinical improvement as measured using the Brief Psychiatric Rating Scale, the Clinical Global Impression scale, and the Global Assessment of Functioning scale. In examining those receiving TBZ-clozapine specifically, there was no indication of drug-drug interactions or difference in response compared to the overall sample. Tetrabenazine was not effective, as used here, in augmenting clinical response in treatment-resistant schizophrenia. It may be premature, however, to discount the potential benefits of VMAT2 inhibitors in treating psychosis in light of what is presently understood regarding presynaptic DA's role and evidence that \"endogenous sensitization\" may occur over the course of the illness.\n",

        "Abstract":"BACKGROUND: We report the findings from the first large, double-blind, placebo-controlled study conducted to evaluate the efficacy and safety of risperidone in the treatment of psychotic and behavioral symptoms in institutionalized elderly patients with dementia.\nMETHOD: 625 patients (67.8% women; mean age = 82.7 years) with DSM-IV diagnoses of Alzheimer's disease (73%), vascular dementia (15%), or mixed dementia (12%) and significant psychotic and behavioral symptoms were included. Each patient was randomly assigned to receive placebo or 0.5 mg\/day, 1 mg\/day, or 2 mg\/day of risperidone for 12 weeks. The primary outcome measure was the Behavioral Pathology in Alzheimer's Disease rating scale (BEHAVE-AD).\nRESULTS: The study was completed by 70% of the patients. Baseline Functional Assessment Staging scores were 6 or 7 in more than 95% of the patients, indicating severe dementia. At endpoint, significantly greater reductions in BEHAVE-AD total scores and psychosis and aggressiveness subscale scores were seen in patients receiving 1 and 2 mg\/day of risperidone than in placebo patients (p = .005 and p < .001, respectively). At week 12, 0.5 mg\/day of risperidone was superior to placebo in reducing BEHAVE-AD aggression scores (p = .02). More adverse events were reported by patients receiving 2 mg\/day of risperidone than 1 mg\/day. The most common dose-related adverse events were extrapyramidal symptoms, somnolence, and mild peripheral edema. The frequency of extrapyramidal symptoms in patients receiving 1 mg\/day of risperidone was not significantly greater than in placebo patients.\nCONCLUSION: Risperidone significantly improved symptoms of psychosis and aggressive behavior in patients with severe dementia. Results show that 1 mg\/day of risperidone is an appropriate dose for most elderly patients with dementia.\n",

        "Abstract":"OBJECTIVE: The impact of the atypical antipsychotics olanzapine, quetiapine, and risperidone on cognition in patients with Alzheimer's disease is unclear. The authors assessed the effects of time and treatment on neuropsychological functioning during the Clinical Antipsychotic Trials of Intervention Effectiveness-Alzheimer's Disease study (CATIE-AD).\nMETHOD: CATIE-AD included 421 outpatients with Alzheimer's disease and psychosis or agitated\/aggressive behavior who were randomly assigned to receive masked, flexible-dose olanzapine, quetiapine, risperidone, or placebo. Based on their clinicians' judgment, patients could discontinue the originally assigned medication and receive another randomly assigned medication. Patients were followed for 36 weeks, and cognitive assessments were obtained at baseline and at 12, 24, and 36 weeks. Outcomes were compared for 357 patients for whom data were available for at least one cognitive measure at baseline and one follow-up assessment that took place after they had been on their prescribed medication or placebo for at least 2 weeks.\nRESULTS: Overall, patients showed steady, significant declines over time in most cognitive areas, including in scores on the Mini-Mental State Examination (MMSE; -2.4 points over 36 weeks) and the cognitive subscale of the Alzheimer's Disease Assessment Scale (-4.4 points). Cognitive function declined more in patients receiving antipsychotics than in those given placebo on multiple cognitive measures, including the MMSE, the cognitive subscale of the Brief Psychiatric Rating Scale, and a cognitive summary score summarizing change on 18 cognitive tests.\nCONCLUSIONS: In CATIE-AD, atypical antipsychotics were associated with worsening cognitive function at a magnitude consistent with 1 year's deterioration compared with placebo. Further cognitive impairment is an additional risk of treatment with atypical antipsychotics that should be considered when treating patients with Alzheimer's disease.\n",

        "Abstract":"BACKGROUND: a large and increasing number of older people in the UK are living in care homes. Dementia is a frequent reason underlying admission and determining care needs, but prevalence data are becoming increasingly outdated and reliant on brief screening instruments.\nOBJECTIVE: to describe the prevalence and severity of dementia, depression, behavioural problems and relevant medication use in a representative sample of residential and nursing care home residents.\nDESIGN\/SETTING: a survey conducted in 15 randomly selected South East London care homes. Consensus clinical dementia diagnoses were made from multi-source information, and the Clinical Dementia Rating (CDR) Scale applied. Depression was ascertained using the Cornell Depression in Dementia Scale and psychological\/behavioural problems using the Neuropsychiatric Inventory (NPI).\nPARTICIPANTS: three hundred and one residents with a mean (SD) age of 83.5 (9.8) and 65.8% female were included.\nRESULTS: dementia (CDR 1-3) prevalence was 75.1% overall, 55.8% in residential homes, 91.0% in residential elderly mentally infirm care and 77.0% in nursing homes. Depression prevalences were 26.5, 22.0 and 29.6%, respectively, and mean (95% CI) NPI severity scores 3.99 (3.47-4.50), 6.34 (5.29-7.39) and 6.10 (5.50-6.70) with 87.3% of the sample exhibiting at least one NPI symptom. Antidepressants were prescribed in 25.6, 25.0 and 41.3%, respectively, and antipsychotics in 7.0, 34.1 and 19.1%.\nCONCLUSION: dementia is substantially more common in care homes than recorded diagnoses would suggest, but studies using brief screening instruments may overestimate prevalence. High prevalences of depressive and\/or behavioural symptoms and psychotropic use suggest significant unmet need. Copyright © The Author 2014.

        "Abstract":"BACKGROUND: Although few placebo-controlled neuroleptic discontinuation studies have been conducted in people with dementia, such studies are essential to inform key clinical decisions.\nMETHOD: A 3-month, double-blind, placebo-controlled, neuroleptic discontinuation study (June 2000 to June 2002) was completed in 100 care-facility residents with probable or possible Alzheimer's disease (according to National Institute of Neurological and Communicative Diseases and Stroke\/Alzheimer's Disease and Related Disorders Association criteria) who had no severe behavioral disturbances and had been taking neuroleptics for longer than 3 months. The Neuropsychiatric Inventory (NPI) was used to measure changes in behavioral and psychiatric symptoms. Quality of life was evaluated using Dementia Care Mapping.\nRESULTS: Eighty-two patients completed the 1-month assessment (36 placebo, 46 active). The number of participants withdrawing overall (N = 14 [30%] placebo, N = 14 [26%] active treatment) and because of exacerbation of behavioral symptoms (N = 6 [13%] placebo, N = 5 [9%] active treatment) was similar in the neuroleptic- and placebo-treated patients. As hypothesized, patients with baseline NPI scores at or below the median (< or = 14) had a particularly good outcome, with a significantly greater reduction of agitation in the patients receiving placebo (Mann-Whitney U test, z = 2.4, p =.018), while patients with higher baseline NPI scores were significantly more likely to develop marked behavioral problems if discontinued from neuroleptics (chi(2) = 6.8, p =.009). There was no overall difference in the change of quality of life parameters between groups.\nDISCUSSION: A standardized evaluation with an instrument such as the NPI may be a clinical indicator of which people with dementia are likely to benefit from discontinuation of neuroleptic treatment.\n",

        "Abstract":"OBJECTIVE: In patients with Alzheimer's disease (AD) with psychosis or agitation that respond to haloperidol treatment, to evaluate the risk of relapse following discontinuation.\nMETHODS: In outpatients with AD with symptoms of psychosis or agitation, responders to 20 weeks of haloperidol (0.5-5 mg daily) were randomized to a 24-week, double-blind pilot trial of discontinuation on placebo versus continuation haloperidol. Phase A response criteria were minimum 50% reduction in three target symptoms, and improvement on the Clinical Global Impression-Change (CGI-C) score for psychosis\/agitation. Phase B relapse criteria required 50% worsening in target symptoms and on the CGI-C. alpha = 0.1 was the significance criterion in this pilot study.\nRESULTS: Of 44 patients, 22 patients responded in Phase A. The sum score of target symptoms, and Brief Psychiatric Rating Scale (BPRS) psychosis and hostile suspiciousness factor scores, decreased in Phase A (p's < 0.001). Extrapyramidal signs increased in Phase A (p < 0.01). Of 22 responders, 21 patients entered Phase B, and 20 had at least one follow-up visit. Four of 10 patients (40%) on continuation haloperidol relapsed compared to eight of 10 patients on placebo (80%, chi(2) = 3.3, p = 0.07). In survival analyses, time to relapse was shorter on placebo than haloperidol (chi(2) = 4.1, p = 0.04).\nCONCLUSIONS: Haloperidol open treatment was efficacious, and relapse was greater on placebo than with haloperidol continuation. In patients with AD who have psychosis or agitation and respond to antipsychotic medication, the increased risk of relapse after discontinuation needs to be weighed against the side effects associated with continuing the medication.

Outcome measures were the Cohen-Mansfield Agitation Inventory (CMAI), the Behavioral Pathology in Alzheimer's Disease (BEHAVE-AD) rating scale, and the Clinical Global Impression of Severity (CGI-S) and of Change (CGI-C) scales.\nRESULTS: A total of 345 patients were randomized to treatment with risperidone or placebo, and 337 patients received at least one dose of study drug. The trial was completed by 67% of patients in the placebo group and 73% of patients in the risperidone group. The mean +\/- SE dose of risperidone was 0.95 +\/- 0.03 mg\/day. The primary endpoint of the study, the difference from baseline to endpoint in CMAI total aggression score, showed a significant reduction in aggressive behavior for risperidone versus placebo (p <.001). A similar improvement was also seen for the CMAI total non-aggression subscale (p <.002) and for the BEHAVE-AD total (p <.001) and psychotic symptoms subscale (p =.004). At endpoint, the CGI-S and the CGI-C scores indicated a significantly greater improvement with risperidone compared with placebo (p <.001). Overall, 94% and 92% of the risperidone and placebo groups, respectively, reported at least 1 adverse event. Somnolence and urinary tract infection were more common with risperidone treatment, whereas agitation was more common with placebo. There was no significant difference in the number of patients who reported extrapyramidal symptoms between the risperidone (23%) and placebo (16%) groups.\nCONCLUSION: Treatment with low-dose (mean = 0.95 mg\/day) risperidone resulted in significant improvement in aggression, agitation, and psychosis associated with dementia.\n",

In HD preclinical models, while no psychotropic has convincingly affected huntingtin gene, HD modifying gene, or huntingtin protein expression, psychotropic neuroprotective effects include upregulated huntingtin autophagy (lithium), histone acetylation (lithium, valproate, lamotrigine), miR-222 (lithium-plus-valproate), mitochondrial protection (haloperidol, trifluoperazine, imipramine, desipramine, nortriptyline, maprotiline, trazodone, sertraline, venlafaxine, melatonin), neurogenesis (lithium, valproate, fluoxetine, sertraline), and BDNF (lithium, valproate, sertraline) and downregulated AP-1 DNA binding (lithium), p53 (lithium), huntingtin aggregation (antipsychotics, lithium), and apoptosis (trifluoperazine, loxapine, lithium, desipramine, nortriptyline, maprotiline, cyproheptadine, melatonin). In HD live mouse models, delayed disease onset (nortriptyline, melatonin), striatal preservation (haloperidol, tetrabenazine, lithium, sertraline), memory preservation (imipramine, trazodone, fluoxetine, sertraline, venlafaxine), motor improvement (tetrabenazine, lithium, valproate, imipramine, nortriptyline, trazodone, sertraline, venlafaxine), and extended survival (lithium, valproate, sertraline, melatonin) have been documented. Upregulated CREB binding protein (CBP; valproate, dextromethorphan) and downregulated histone deacetylase (HDAC; valproate) await demonstration in HD models. Most preclinical findings await replication and their limitations are reviewed. The most promising findings involve replicated striatal neuroprotection and phenotypic disease modification in transgenic mice for tetrabenazine and for sertraline. Clinical data consist of an uncontrolled lithium case series (n = 3) suggesting non-progression and a primarily negative double-blind, placebo-controlled clinical trial of lamotrigine.\n",

        "Abstract":"Dementia with Lewy-bodies (DLB) and Parkinson's disease dementia (PDD) are no rare causes of dementia. Both have neuropathologically, clinically, and neurochemically much in common. In the course of both conditions frequently psychotic symptoms occur, often induced by antiparkinsonian medication. Treatment of psychotic features with conventional antipsychotics is not tolerated in many cases. Therefore low-dose clozapine treatment is acknowledged usual practise for psychosis in Parkinson's disease and a case report indicates efficacy for psychosis in DLB, too. All other atypical antipsychotics except risperidone are not licensed for dementia in Germany, but risperidone is contraindicated in DLB due to manufacturer's notice and usually not well tolerated in DLB and Parkinson's disease. Open trials indicate safety for treatment of psychosis in DLB and PDD with quetiapine. Randomized controlled trials indicate, that quetiapine is less effective than clozapine against psychotic symptoms in both conditions, although comparatively safe. Cholinesterase inhibitors, especially rivastigmine, are a therapeutic alternative for treating both psychotic and cognitive symptoms in both conditions. Parkinsonism in DLB-patients responds worse to levodopa compared to patient with Parkinson's disease. Anticholinergic drugs often induce delirium in demented patients and therefore should be avoided. The same problem is associated with dopamine agonists in PDD and DLB. Amantadine, a NMDA-receptor antagonist like memantine, potentially bears the same risk of worsening psychotic symptoms. The following preliminary recommendation for drug treatment of PDD and DLB can be given: Stop all anticholinergic medication and reduce levodopa and other antiparkinsonian medication to the tolerated minimum. Levodopa alone is preferred. Treat with cholinesterase inhibitors to the maximum tolerated dose. If there is no adequate response regarding psychotic symptoms, add quetiapine. If this approach fails, replace quetiapine by low-dose clozapine. If behavioural disturbances are due to depression, anxiety, or irritability, treatment with an antidepressant, preferably citalopram, is an option.\n",

        "Abstract":"Neuropsychiatric and behavioral symptoms are frequent and problematic components of Alzheimer's disease (AD). In two previously reported studies, metrifonate was shown to benefit behavioral symptoms as assessed by the Neuropsychiatric Inventory (NPI). In this post hoc analysis, detailed studies were completed to determine the effects of metrifonate on individual symptoms. This study was a retrospective analysis of pooled NPI data from two double-blind, placebo-controlled, multicenter 26-week studies of metrifonate that had achieved similar levels of cholinesterase inhibition. Mild-to-moderate probable AD patients received placebo (n = 222) or metrifonate (n = 450) 30 to 60 mg by weight or a 50-mg fixed dose once daily. At 26 weeks, metrifonate-treated patients had significantly reduced NPI total scores (P = .001) and fewer neuropsychiatric symptoms when compared with placebo-treated patients, including hallucinations (P = .004), agitation\/aggression (P = .006), depression\/dysphoria (P = .011), apathy (P = .019), and aberrant motor behavior (P = .008). Metrifonate reduced or stabilized neuropsychiatric disturbances in 60% of symptomatic patients. Almost 40% of metrifonate-treated patients had a clinically relevant reduction (> or = 30% decrease in NPI score) in their neuropsychiatric disturbances (P = .002). High proportions of metrifonate-treated patients manifested clinically relevant reductions in anxiety (58%, P = .009), apathy (51%, P = .020), and depression\/dysphoria (50%, P = .021) compared to placebo. The metrifonate-associated reductions in NPI scores were evident by week 12 and were maintained for the 26-week study period. There was an overall effect size of metrifonate of approximately 15% on total NPI scores when compared to placebo. Metrifonate significantly reduced many of the psychiatric and behavioral symptoms of AD. The observations suggest that enhancement of cholinergic functions in AD has beneficial effects on behavior.\n",

        "Abstract":"BACKGROUND: Low cerebrospinal fluid (CSF) amyloid-beta(1-42) concentration and high total-tau\/Abeta(1-42) ratio have been recommended to support the diagnosis of prodromal Alzheimer's disease (AD) in patients with amnestic mild cognitive impairment (aMCI) and also to select patients for clinical trials (Shaw et al, Ann Neurol 2009;65:403-13; Dubois et al, Lancet Neurol 2007;6:734-46).\nMETHODS: We tested this recommendation with clinical trials simulations using patients from the Alzheimer Disease Neuroimaging Initiative who fulfilled the following entry criteria: (1) aMCI, (2) aMCI with CSF Abeta(1-42) <or=192 mg\/mL, (3) and aMCI with total-tau\/Abeta(1-42) >0.39. For each criterion, we randomly resampled the database obtaining samples for 1000 trials for each trial scenario, planning for 1 or 2 year trials with samples from 50 to 400 patients per treatment or placebo group, with up to 40% dropouts, outcomes after using the AD assessment scale-cognitive subscale and clinical dementia rating scale with effect sizes ranging from 0.15 to 0.75, and calculated statistical power.\nFINDINGS: Approximately 70% to 74% of aMCI patients with CSF measures met biomarker criteria. The addition of the low Abeta(1-42) or high tau\/Abeta(1-42) requirement resulted in minimal or no increase in the power of the trials compared with enrolling aMCI without requiring the biomarker criteria. Slightly larger mean differences between the placebo and treatment groups fulfilling biomarker criteria were offset by increased outcome variability within the groups.\nINTERPRETATIONS: Although patients with aMCI or patients with prodromal AD meeting CSF biomarkers criteria were slightly more cognitively impaired and showed greater decline than patients with aMCI diagnosed without considering the biomarkers, the requirement of biomarker-positive patients would most likely not result in more efficient clinical trials, and trials would take longer because fewer patients would be available. A CSF Abeta(1-42) marker, however, could be useful as an explanatory variable or covariate when warranted by the action of a drug. Copyright 2010 The Alzheimer\n",

        "Abstract":"OBJECTIVE: Behavioral disturbances in dementia are extremely prominent and distressful, and often result in serious physical, social, and economic consequences. The authors compared the efficacy and tolerability of risperidone and haloperidol in the treatment of behavioral and psychological symptoms of dementia (BPSD) in institutionalized elderly Korean patients with Alzheimer disease, vascular dementia, or mixed dementia.\nMETHODS: This was an 18-week double-blind, crossover study involving 120 patients who were randomly assigned to receive flexible doses (0.5-1.5 mg\/day) of risperidone or haloperidol. BPSD were assessed using the Korean version of the Behavioral Pathology in Alzheimer's Disease Rating Scale (BEHAVE-AD-K), the Korean version of the Cohen-Mansfield Agitation Inventory (CMAI-K), and the Clinical Global Impression of Change scale (CGI-C). Safety and tolerability assessments included the Extrapyramidal Symptom Rating Scale and the incidence of adverse events.\nRESULTS: Both risperidone and haloperidol were efficacious in alleviating BPSD. However, when receiving risperidone, patients showed significantly greater improvement than when receiving haloperidol in the total and subscale scores of the BEHAVE-AD-K, the total and subscale scores of the CMAI-K, and the scores on the CGI-C scale. Also, risperidone had an additional benefit on aggressiveness and anxieties\/phobias. The risk of antipsychotic-induced parkinsonism throughout this study was significantly lower with risperidone than with haloperidol.\nCONCLUSION: Risperidone had a favorable efficacy and tolerability profile compared with haloperidol in the treatment of BPSD in this patient population.\n",

We aimed to assess whether aripiprazole is associated with a higher probability of remission than is placebo.\nMETHODS: We did a randomised, double-blind, placebo-controlled trial at three centres in the USA and Canada to test the efficacy and safety of aripiprazole augmentation for adults aged older than 60 years with treatment-resistant depression (Montgomery Asberg Depression Rating Scale [MADRS] score of >=15). Patients who did not achieve remission during a pre-trial with venlafaxine extended-release (150-300 mg\/day) were randomly assigned (1:1) to the addition of aripiprazole (target dose 10 mg [maximum 15 mg] daily) daily or placebo for 12 weeks. The computer-generated randomisation was done in blocks and stratified by site. Only the database administrator and research pharmacists had knowledge of treatment assignment. The primary endpoint was remission, defined as an MADRS score of 10 or less (and at least 2 points below the score at the start of the randomised phase) at both of the final two consecutive visits, analysed by intention to treat. This trial is registered with ClinicalTrials.gov, number NCT00892047.\nFINDINGS: From July 20, 2009, to Dec 30, 2013, we recruited 468 eligible participants, 181 (39%) of whom did not remit and were randomly assigned to aripiprazole (n=91) or placebo (n=90). A greater proportion of participants in the aripiprazole group achieved remission than did those in the placebo group (40 [44%] vs 26 [29%] participants; odds ratio [OR] 2.0 [95% CI 1.1-3.7], p=0.03; number needed to treat [NNT] 6.6 [95% CI 3.5-81.8]). Akathisia was the most common adverse effect of aripiprazole (reported in 24 [26%] of 91 participants on aripiprazole vs 11 [12%] of 90 on placebo). Compared with placebo, aripiprazole was also associated with more Parkinsonism (15 [17%] of 86 vs two [2%] of 81 participants), but not with treatment-emergent suicidal ideation (13 [21%] of 61 vs 19 [29%] of 65 participants) or other measured safety variables.\nINTERPRETATION: In adults aged 60 years or older who do not achieve remission from depression with a first-line antidepressant, the addition of aripiprazole is effective in achieving and sustaining remission. Tolerability concerns include the potential for akathisia and Parkinsonism.\nFUNDING: National Institute of Mental Health, UPMC Endowment in Geriatric Psychiatry, Taylor Family Institute for Innovative Psychiatric Research, National Center for Advancing Translational Sciences, and the Campbell Family Mental Health Research Institute.

        "Title":"Comparison of the efficacy of new and conventional antipsychotic drugs in the treatment of behavioral and psychological symptoms of dementia (BPSD)",
        "Abstract":"This double-blind study evaluated the efficacy and safety of risperidone or olanzapine vs. promazine in the treatment of behavioral and psychological symptoms in dementia(BPSD). Patients were required to be 65 years or older, to have DSM-IV diagnoses of Alzheimer's disease (AD), vascular dementia (VD) or a combination of both. A brain computerized tomography (CT) was performed for all the patients; 60 demented patients,27 men (45 %) and 33 women (55 %) were selected for this study. The University of California Los Angeles neuropsychiatric inventory (NPI) was administered at baseline, then after 4 and 8 weeks. Patients had at least a score of 24 or more. The Hoehn and Yahr scale was used for evaluating parkinsonism. The scales were administered by an examinator who was not aware of the kind of treatment of the patients. After a wash-out period of 10 days,20 patients, 9 men and 11 women, mean age 76.6 +\/- 6.0 years, were randomly assigned torisperidone 1 mg daily in divided doses (morning and bedtime) (Group A); 20 patients, 9 men and 11 women, mean age 82.5 +\/- 9.3 years were randomly assigned to olanzapine 5mg at bedtime (Group B), and 20 patients, 9 men and 11 women, mean age 77.6 +\/- 4.6 years, were randomly assigned to promazine 50 mg daily (morning and bedtime) (Group C). In case of lack of clinical response, after 4 weeks, the dose could be increased to 2 mg\/day of risperidone, 10 mg\/day of olanzapine, and to 100 mg\/day of promazine in the respective groups. Repeated measures ANOVA was used for the statistical analysis of rating scales over time (baseline, 4 and 8 weeks). At the end of the 8th week, a global improvement was obtained in 80% of patients treated with risperidone and olanzapine, vs. 65 % of patients treated with promazine (p < 0.01). The results show that risperidone in doses of 1-2 mg\/day and olanzapine in doses of 5-10 mg\/day are effective and safe in the treatment of BPSD. Risperidone presents a major and dose-dependent antidopaminergic action and seems to be preferable when hallucinations and delusions are prevailing symptoms, even if it gives good results on aggression and wandering. Olanzapine seems to be faster in its sedative effect, probably for H1 receptor blockade. Moreover, 5-HT6 antagonism may favor acetylcholine release and this explains why these patients have not presented a cognitive worsening. However, both drugs are comparable or even superior to promazine, with significantly fewer side effects of both anticholinergic and extrapyramidal character.\n",

        "Abstract":"BACKGROUND: Behavioural and psychological symptoms of dementia (BPSD) cannot be regarded as a single clinical syndrome, but rather as a heterogeneous group of symptoms, each of which can be considered as possible targets for therapy.\nOBJECTIVE: To compare the efficacy of risperidone and haloperidol on specific manifestations of BPSD.\nMETHODS: A post-hoc analysis was conducted using data from an 18-week, randomized, double-blind, crossover head-to-head trial of risperidone vs haloperidol in treating 114 nursing-home residents with BPSD. Dependent variables were item scores of the Korean versions of the Behavioural Pathology in Alzheimer's Disease Rating Scale (BEHAVE-AD-K) and Cohen-Mansfield Agitation Inventory (CMAI-K).\nRESULTS: On the BEHAVE-AD-K, risperidone was significantly more effective than haloperidol in treating wandering (p = 0.0496), agitation (p = 0.0091), diurnal rhythm disturbances (p = 0.0137), anxiety regarding upcoming events (p = 0.0002), and other anxieties (p = 0.0088). On the CMAI-K, risperidone was significantly more effective in treating physical sexual advances (p = 0.0202), pacing and aimless wandering (p = 0.0123), intentional falling (p = 0.0398), hoarding things (p = 0.0499), performing repetitious mannerisms (p = 0.0048), repetitive sentence or questions (p = 0.0025), complaining (p = 0.0101), and negativism (p = 0.0027). Haloperidol was not significantly superior to risperidone on any individual item in either scale.\nCONCLUSIONS: When comparing treatment effects on individual symptoms frequently occurring in patients with dementia, risperidone significantly improved symptoms of agitation, wandering, diurnal rhythm disturbance and anxieties, among other symptoms, compared with haloperidol.

        "Title":"Quetiapine in the treatment of schizophrenia and related disorders",
        "Abstract":"Quetiapine was developed in 1985 by scientists at AstraZeneca (formerly Zeneca) Pharmaceuticals. It received official US Food and Drug Administration approval in September 1997 and approval in Germany in 2000. Since then, quetiapine has been used in the treatment of severe mental illness in approximately 70 countries including Canada, most Western European countries, and Japan. Quetiapine is a dibenzothiazepine derivative with a relatively broad receptor binding profile. It has major affinity to cerebral serotonergic (5HT(2A)), histaminergic (H1), and dopaminergic D(1) and D(2) receptors, moderate affinity to alpha(1)- und alpha(2)-adrenergic receptors, and minor affinity to muscarinergic M1 receptors; it demonstrates a substantial selectivity for the limbic system. This receptor occupancy profile with relatively higher affinity for the 5HT(2A) receptor compared with the D(2) receptor is in part responsible for the antipsychotic characteristics and low incidence of extrapyramidal side-effects of quetiapine. The efficacy of quetiapine in reducing positive and negative symptoms of schizophrenia has been proven in several clinical trials with placebo-controlled comparators. Quetiapine has also demonstrated robust efficacy for treatment of cognitive, anxious-depressive, and aggressive symptoms in schizophrenia. Long-term trials show sustained tolerability for a broad spectrum of symptoms. Quetiapine has also proven efficacy and tolerability in the treatment of moderate to severe manic episodes, and in the treatment of juveniles with oppositional-defiant or conduct disorders, and in the geriatric dementia population. Recent data indicate that quetiapine may also be effective in the treatment of bipolar depressive symptoms without increasing the risk of triggering manic episodes, and in borderline personality disorder. In comparison with other antipsychotics, quetiapine has a favorable side-effect profile. In clinical trials only small insignificant prolongations of the QT interval were observed. Weight-gain liabilities and new-onset metabolic side-effects occupy a middle-ground among newer antipsychotics. As a result of its good efficacy and tolerability profile quetiapine has become well established in the treatment of schizophrenia and manic episodes.\n",

        "Abstract":"OBJECTIVE: To assess the efficacy of lamotrigine, a novel antiepileptic drug that inhibits glutamate release, to retard disease progression in Huntington disease (HD).\nBACKGROUND: Excitatory amino acids may cause selective neuronal death in HD, and lamotrigine may inhibit glutamate release in vivo.\nMETHODS: A double-blinded, placebo-controlled study was conducted of 64 patients with motor signs of less than 5 years' duration who were randomly assigned to either placebo or lamotrigine and assessed at 0 (baseline), 12, 24, and 30 months. The primary response variable was total functional capacity (TFC) score. Secondary response variables included the quantified neurological examination and a set of cognitive and motor tests. Repeated fluorodeoxyglucose measurements of regional cerebral metabolism using PET also were included.\nRESULTS: Fifty-five patients (28 on lamotrigine, 27 on placebo) completed the study. Neither the primary response variable nor any of the secondary response variables differed significantly between the treatment groups. Both the lamotrigine and the placebo group deteriorated significantly on the TFC, in the lamotrigine group by 1.89 and the placebo group by 2.11 points. No effect of CAG size on the rate of deterioration could be detected.\nCONCLUSIONS: There was no clear evidence that lamotrigine retarded the progression of early Huntington disease over a period of 30 months. However, more patients on lamotrigine reported symptomatic improvement (53.6 versus 14.8%; p = 0.006), and a trend toward decreased chorea was evident in the treated group (p = 0.08). The study also identified various indices of disease progression, including motor tests and PET studies, that were sensitive to deterioration over time.\n",
