        "Abstract":"Primary membranoproliferative glomerulonephritis (MPGN) has a poor long-term prognosis, with 40 per cent of patients reaching end-stage renal failure after 10 years of observation. Approximately 35 per cent of patients die due to complications of the nephrotic syndrome. This study investigates the effect of acetylsalicylic acid (ASA) combined with dipyridamole on proteinuria and renal function in nephrotic MPGN patients with normal\/moderately reduced glomerular filtration rate (GFR). Fourteen patients with biopsy-proven type I MPGN received ASA (1000 mg\/day) and dipyridamole (300 mg\/day) for 24 months. Proteinuria was reduced from 6.8 +\/- 2.4 g\/day to 1.1 +\/- 0.6 g\/day (p < 0.001). Serum albumin levels increased from 2.2 +\/- 0.5 g\/dL to 3.7 +\/- 0.4 g\/dL (p < 0.001) during the study period after 24 months compared to baseline. Serum creatinine and GFR did not significantly change in patients treated with acetylsaliclylic acid and dipyridamole during the observation period (p < 0.05). Our study suggests that ASA combined with dipyridamole significantly reduces proteinuria without impairing renal function in patients with MPGN.",

        "Abstract":"BACKGROUND: Bronchoscopy with transbronchial and endobronchial biopsy and transbronchial needle aspiration is an important diagnostic tool in the pulmonologist's armamentarium. Safety in patients with pulmonary hypertension is controversial and many bronchoscopists consider this as a contraindication for the procedure.\nOBJECTIVES: To evaluate safety of bronchoscopy in patients with echocardiographic pulmonary hypertension and to compare with patients without it.\nMETHODS: Retrospective analysis of patients who underwent bronchoscopic transbronchial biopsy, endobronchial biopsy and\/or endobronchial ultrasound-guided transbronchial needle aspiration. Patients were divided into two groups based on echocardiographic results: control group with systolic pulmonary artery pressure <36 and a group with elevated systolic pulmonary artery pressure (eSPAP) ≥36.\nRESULTS: One-hundred and ninety patients met the study criteria. Patients in the control group were younger with a lower incidence of chronic kidney disease. There was no difference in prevalence of congestive heart failure, obstructive airway disease, malignancy, liver disease, coagulopathy, use of antiplatelet agent or anticoagulant drugs. Incidence of minor bleeding due to bronchoscopic biopsies was 4.8% in both groups (p = 1.00). Incidence of major bleeding was similar in the groups (one patient in each group). In the control group, one patient had pneumothorax and another required prolonged mechanical ventilation (>4 h). In the eSPAP group, two patients required prolonged mechanical ventilation. There was no procedure-related mortality or sedation complications in the cohort.\nCONCLUSION: Our study provides additional support that in patients with echocardiographic evidence of pulmonary hypertension, transbronchial and endobronchial biopsies and endobronchial ultrasound-guided transbronchial needle aspiration are safe procedures.",

This study examined the severity of AEs from a high-volume thoracic surgery center and its effect on the patient postoperative LOS and readmissions to hospital. This study includes patients who underwent an elective lung resection between September 2018 and January 2020. The AEs were grouped as no AEs, 1 or more minor AEs, and 1 or more major AEs. The effects of the AEs on patient LOS and readmissions were examined using a survival analysis and logistic regression, respectively, while adjusting for the other demographic or clinical variables. Among 488 patients who underwent lung surgery, (Wedge resection [n = 100], Segmentectomy [n = 51], Lobectomy [n = 310], Bilobectomy [n = 10], or Pneumonectomy [n = 17]) for either primary (n = 440) or secondary (n = 48) lung cancers, 179 (36.7%) patients had no AEs, 264 (54.1%) patients had 1 or more minor AEs, and 45 (9.2%) patients had 1 or more major AEs. Overall, the median of LOS was 3 days which varied significantly between AE groups; 2, 4, and 8 days among the no, minor, and major AE groups, respectively. In addition, type of surgery, renal disease (urinary tract infection [UTI], urinary retention, or acute kidney injury), and ASA (American Society of Anesthesiology) score were significant predictors of LOS. Finally, 58 (11.9%) patients were readmitted. Readmission was significantly associated with AE group ( = 0.016). No other variable could significantly predict patient readmission.

        "Abstract":"The main goal of the present study was to investigate comparatively (in the last 8 years) the effects of nonsteroidal antiinflammatory drugs (NSAIDs) on a sample of 100 children diagnosed with juvenile chronic arthritis (JCA). The patients were divided in 3 smaller groups, as follows: group 1--prescribed diclofenac, group 2--paduden and group 3--aspirin. Clinical features and laboratory findings were evaluated after: a 2 months trial, 4 months trial, 6 months trial, 2 years trial, 3 years trial and more than 5 years trial, from the beginning of the NSAIDs therapy. The results were the followings: within the first 12 weeks of therapy with NSAIDs a good response was obtained in 64% (group 1), 59% (group 2) and 53% (group 3) of the managed children, respectively; after 8 years of treatment for the children remained under medical observation in our clinic, the remission was obtained in 68% (diclofenac), 60% (paduden) and 64% (aspirin) of the patients on NSAIDs therapy. The incidence of side-effects in the groups treated with diclofenac and paduden has been present in a smaller percentage and less severe than in the aspirin's group. No child managed with diclofenac had major gastrointestinal, hepatic or renal reactions. These results highlight the superiority of diclofenac as a new drug over aspirin and paduden, in the treatment of JCA.",

        "Published":null,
        "Abstract":"In early childhood, nonsteroidal anti-inflammatory drugs are mainly used to either prevent or treat premature labor of the mother and patent ductus arteriosus of the newborn infant. The most frequently used prostaglandin-synthesis inhibitor is indomethacin. Fetuses exposed to indomethacin in utero have been born with renal developmental defects, and in both the unborn child and the term and premature newborn this drug may compromise renal glomerular function. The latter has in the past also been observed when i.v. indomethacin or i.v. acetylsalicylic acid (aspirin) were administered to newborn rabbits. The present experiments were designed to evaluate whether ibuprofen has less renal side effects than indomethacin, as claimed. Three groups of anesthetized, ventilated, normoxemic neonatal rabbits were infused with increasing doses of ibuprofen (0.02, 0.2, 2.0 mg\/kg body weight) and the following renal parameters were measured: urine volume, urinary sodium excretion, GFR, and renal plasma flow. Renal blood flow, filtration fraction, and the renal vascular resistance were calculated according to standard formulae. Intravenous ibuprofen caused a dose-dependent, significant reduction in urine volume, GFR, and renal blood flow with a fall in filtration fraction in the animals receiving the highest dose of ibuprofen (2 mg\/kg body weight). There was a very steep rise in renal vascular resistance. Urinary sodium excretion decreased. These experiments in neonatal rabbits clearly show that acute i.v. doses of ibuprofen also have significant renal hemodynamic and functional side effects, not less than seen previously with indomethacin.",

        "Published":null,
        "Abstract":"The pathogenesis of preeclampsia stems from aberrant changes at the placental interface. The trophoblastic endovascular invasion of tonic spiral arteries that converts them to passive conduits falters. Uteroplacental insufficiency and fetoplacental hypoxemia result. Secondary maternal oxidative stress and an excessive inflammatory response to pregnancy generate the clinical syndrome of preeclampsia. Current treatment focuses on preventing seizures, controlling hypertension, preserving renal function and delivering the baby. We propose that the pathophysiological changes induced by preeclampsia in the placenta parallel those caused by persistent hypoxemia in the lungs at high altitude or with chronic obstructive pulmonary disease. Unrelenting pulmonary hypoxic vasoconstriction induces pulmonary hypertension and cor pulmonale. Inhalation of nitric oxide and phosphodiesterase-5 inhibitors opposes pulmonary hypoxic vasoconstriction, alleviates pulmonary hypertension and improves systemic oxygenation. Notably nitric oxide donor therapy also counters hypoxemic fetoplacental vasoconstriction, a biological response analogous to pulmonary hypoxic vasoconstriction. Fetal oxygenation and nutrition improve. Placental upstream resistance to umbilical arterial blood flow decreases. Fetal right ventricular impedance falls. Heart failure (cor placentale) is avoided. Emergency preterm delivery can be postponed. Other than low dose aspirin and antioxidants vitamins C and E no available therapy specifically targets the underlying disease profile. We hypothesize that, like nitric oxide donation, pharmacological inhibition of placental phosphodiesterase-5 will also protect the fetus but for a longer time. Biological availability of guanosine 3'5'-cyclic monophosphate is boosted due to slowed hydrolysis. Adenosine 3'5'-cyclic monphosphate levels increase in parallel. Cyclic nucleotide accumulation dilates intact tonic spiral arteries and counters hypoxemic fetoplacental vasoconstriction. Intervillous and intravillous perfusion pick up. Maternal to fetal placental circulatory matching improves. Enhanced placental oxygen uptake alleviates hypoxemic fetal stress. Appropriate fetal nutrition resumes. Cor placentale and severe intrauterine growth restriction are averted. Increased maternal cyclic nucleotide concentrations promote systemic vasodilatation so that blood pressures fall. Preemption of oxidative stress initiated by \"consumptive\" oxidation of nitric oxide stabilizes the vascular endothelium and corrects coagulopathy. Anti-inflammatory and immunosuppressant adenosine 3'5'-cyclic monphosphate offsets the extreme gestational inflammatory response. Cellular injury and multi-organ damage are prevented. One tablet a day of the new long acting phosphodiesterase-5 inhibitor, tadalafil (half life of 17.5 h) theoretically should allow a preterm pregnancy affected by preeclampsia to continue safely. Selective monitoring of vital organ functions guards against life-threatening maternal complications. Regular biophysical profiling warns the obstetrician of impending fetal compromise. Fetal growth and vital organ maturation can continue. As a result workloads imposed upon neonatal intensivists will lighten. Parental anxiety and concern will be allayed. The cost of treating preeclamptic mothers and their extremely low birth weight infants will decrease. Money saved by midwifery services in poorer states can be used to pay for better prenatal care. Severe preeclampsia\/eclampsia will be less common. Maternal and perinatal morbidity and mortality will be reduced. Because the human immunodeficiency virus often infects individuals at a workforce eligible age, the global acquired immunodeficiency syndrome pandemic has already brought many nations to the brink of economic ruin. Potentially productive lives saved for the future will help restore them fiscally.",

They were chronologically divided into two groups: 41 patients (group A), using an older ultrasound machine; and 44 patients (group B), using a newer ultrasound machine. Nine patients biopsied with a manual 14G Tru-cut needle served as the control (group C).\nRESULTS: The number of \"attempted\" passes at the kidney was 4.0 +\/- 0.1 in group B, 4.7 +\/- 0.3 in group A (P < 0.05 vs. group B), and 5.8 +\/- 0.5 in group C (P < 0.01 vs. group B). The number of successful passes did not differ (3.3 +\/- 0.1, 3.3 +\/- 0.1, 3.1 +\/- 0.2). The ratio of \"attempted\/successful\" was 1.28 +\/- 0.07 in group B, 1.95 +\/- 0.38 in A, and 1.90 +\/- 0.21 in C (P < 0.01 vs. B). The number of glomeruli obtained was similar in the three groups.

        "Abstract":"BACKGROUND AND OBJECTIVE: Angioplasty in patients with renal artery stenosis aims at reducing blood pressure and at improving kidney function. Its efficacy has however been questioned by recent published data. It was the aim of this retrospective study to compare angioplasty with medical treatment in an unselected patient population.\nMETHODS: Data on 109 patients were retrospectively analysed. This cohort included all those patients admitted to the Lippe-Detmold Hospital between 1992 and 2008 for renal artery stenosis. The data included blood pressure, creatinine-based calculated glomerular filtration rate (cGFR), any renal dialysis, cardiovascular risk factors, events and survival time after transluminal renal angioplasty or drug treatment, respectively.\nRESULTS: Patients who had undergone angioplasty were younger (p = 0.04), had less cardiovascular co-morbidity (p < 0.01), but a higher degree of stenosis (p < 0.01). After a median follow-up of 32.5 (angioplasty) and 36.0 months (drug treatment), respectively, a significant decrease of cGFR was recorded in drug treated patients (- 16.2 ml\/min, 95 %, CI - 25.7 to - 6.7) but not in the angioplasty group (- 4.5 ml\/min, 95 %, CI - 13.5 to 4.5). There were no other significant differences were not observed.\nCONCLUSION: Younger patients with a high degree of renal artery stenosis but without generalized atherosclerosis more frequently underwent angioplasty in clinical practice. The smaller post-angioplasty reduction in the loss of renal function in this group needs to be validated in a prospective, randomized study.",

        "Abstract":"2\nDual antiplatelet therapy (DAPT) was currently recommended for transcatheter aortic valve implantation (TAVI) postoperative management in clinical application. However, POPular-TAVI trial showed DAPT increased the incidence of adverse events compared to single antiplatelet therapy (SAPT). Herein, we performed a meta-analysis to investigate the effect of SAPT versus DAPT on the adverse events after TAVI. Eleven studies were available from PubMed, Embase, Cochrane Library, and Web of Science from inception to April 1, 2021. The pooled effect size was presented as relative risk (RR) with 95% confidence intervals (CIs). The sensitivity analysis was used to assess the stability of analysis results, and Begg's test was applied to evaluate the publication bias. The Cochran Q test and the I statistic were used to evaluate the heterogeneity, and the source of heterogeneity was explored by meta-regression. A total of 4804 patients were obtained, with 2257 in SAPT group and 2547 in DAPT group. Compared to the DAPT, SAPT was associated with the decreased risk of all-cause bleeding (RR: 0.51, 95% CI: 0.44-0.61), major bleeding (RR: 0.53, 95% CI: 0.32-0.86), and minor bleeding (RR: 0.58, 95% CI: 0.34-0.98). There were no significant differences in mortality and myocardial infarction events, stroke events, and acute kidney injury between the two groups.

We also surveyed DOAC-treated patients who were hospitalized due to a stroke during the 5-year study period to analyze the association between stroke events and IRDs.

One-year major adverse cardiac events (MACE) were defined as a composite of death, myocardial infarction (MI), or target vessel revascularization. Outcomes were adjusted using multivariable Cox regression methods.\nRESULTS: During the study period, 16,889 patients underwent PCI including 13.7% ITDM, 34.0% non-ITDM, and 52.3% non-DM patients. Patients with DM were younger, including more females and non-white patients, with higher body mass index and greater prevalence of prior revascularization and chronic kidney disease. Compared to others, ITDM patients more often presented with acute coronary syndrome, in-stent restenosis, or severe lesion calcification. There were no differences in discharge rates of dual antiplatelet therapy and statins, whereas beta-blockers were more commonly prescribed in DM patients. At 1-year, both ITDM and non-ITDM patients had greater risk of MACE compared with non-DM patients, and ITDM conferred greater adjusted risk than non-ITDM (ITDM = HR: 2.11, 95% CI [1.79,2.50]; non-ITDM = HR: 1.27, 95%CI [1.09,1.47]).\nCONCLUSIONS: The negative prognostic effect of DM following contemporary PCI is heightened in the presence of insulin treatment, compared to non-DM patients.

It is suggested that in this child the aspirin therapy predisposed the renal medulla to hypoxic damage induced by the carditis and congestive heart failure. It is therefore recommended that children receiving aspirin or other nonsteroidal anti-inflammatory drugs, even for a short time, be closely observed and the drug discontinued of hypoxia is evident. Moreover, during illnesses tending to cause hypoxia such as carditis, aspirin or other nonsteroidal anti-inflammatory drugs are best avoided since they are additional risk factors for renal damage.",

The frequency of these complications is particularly increased in patients with severe hypertension and those with preexisting cardiovascular and renal disease. Such women should receive appropriate antihypertensive therapy and frequent evaluations of maternal and fetal well-being. In contrast, in patients with mild essential chronic hypertension, the maternal and perinatal benefits from antihypertensive medications are highly controversial. A review of the literature revealed two placebo-controlled studies, four trials comparing treatment versus no medication, and three comparisons of methyldopa and oxprenolol. In only one of these studies were subjects randomized in the first trimester. No differences in pregnancy outcome were found with the use of antihypertensive drugs. Evaluation of the woman with chronic hypertension who is considering pregnancy should begin before conception to establish the cause and severity of the hypertension. Appropriate management should include frequent evaluation of maternal and fetal well-being; antihypertensive medications may be useful in patients with severe disease as well as in those with target organ involvement.",

Their age at onset was 5-13 years (mean 9.8 +\/- 2.1 years), less than that reported in recent years of children with lupus nephritis. All patients had clinical symptoms and signs and\/or laboratory findings of renal involvement. Renal biopsy, performed in all patients, showed: minimal change in 3 patients, mesangial glomerulonephritis in 5, focal proliferative glomerulonephritis in 3 and membranous glomerulonephritis in one patient. There was no correlation between age at onset and histological categories, while clinical data were well correlated with the degree of histological involvement. 11 patients were followed for 5.16 +\/- 3.2 years (range 1-13 years); 7 patients are in complete remission, 3 patients have only microscopic hematuria and\/or mild proteinuria, one patient died because of infection complicating pulmonary involvement. Our report confirms a more favorable evolution of lupus nephritis in children than in adults. In particular none of our patients whose disease started before the age of 10 years had poor outcome, in contrast to previous report describing a higher mortality and morbidity in younger children. The more favorable prognosis of our patients could depend not only on the absence of the more severe form of lupus nephritis that is diffuse proliferative glomerulonephritis, but also on the earlier diagnosis and subsequent therapy.",

Percutaneous coronary intervention in the cirrhotic population also has inherent risks; however, quantifiable data on long-term outcomes are lacking.\nMETHODS: Patients with angiographically significant CAD and cirrhosis were identified from the catheterization lab databases of the University of Pennsylvania Health System between 2007 and 2015. Outcomes were obtained from the medical record and telephonic contact with patients\/families.\nRESULTS: Percutaneous coronary intervention was successfully performed in 42 patients (51 PCIs). Twenty-nine patients with significant CAD were managed medically (36 angiograms). The primary outcome (a composite of mortality, subsequent revascularization, and myocardial infarction) was not significantly different between the 2 groups during a follow-up period at 1 year (PCI: 50%, Control: 40%,  = .383). In the PCI group, a composite adverse outcome rate that included acute kidney injury (AKI), severe bleed, and peri-procedural stroke was elevated (40%), with severe bleeding occurring after 23% of PCI events and post-procedural AKI occurring after 26% of events. The medical management group had significantly fewer total matched adverse outcomes (17% vs 40% in the PCI group,  = .03), with severe bleeding occurring after 11% of events and AKI occurring after 6% of events. Increased risk of adverse events following PCI was associated with severity of liver disease by Child-Pugh class.\nCONCLUSIONS: Percutaneous coronary intervention in patients with cirrhosis is associated with an elevated risk of adverse events, including severe bleeding and AKI.",

They were divided into two groups: PSL+CPA group (n = 26, male\/female = 11\/15, age 40+\/-3 years (SEM)) or control group undergone conventional therapy with or without antiplatelet agents (n = 19, male\/female = 10\/9, age 41+\/-3). In PSL+CPA group, PSL and CPA treatment commenced using a dose of 30 and 50 mg\/day, respectively. PSL was reduced by 5 mg every month.\nRESULTS: The clinical parameters at the start of treatment such as age, gender, histological score, blood pressure, urinary protein excretion and serum creatinine concentration (SCr) were not different between the groups. The mean observation period in PSL+CPA group (3.3+\/-0.3 years) was not different from the control group (4.0+\/-0.7 years). In PSL+CPA group, urinary protein excretion, defined as the ratio of urinary protein to creatinine concentration (UP\/UCr), significantly decreased from 3.9+\/-0.4 to 1.3 +\/-0.2 (p<0.01), whereas it remained high in the control group (3.8+\/-0.7 to 2.7+\/-0.8). The progression rate (PR), which was determined by the slope of the correlation between time after renal biopsy and reciprocal SCr, was significantly lower in PSL+CPA (0.054+\/-0.014) than in the control group (0.172+\/-0.032 dl\/mg\/year, p<0.001). Our results indicated that PSL+CPA combination therapy was effective in slowing the progression of moderately advanced IgAN.\nCONCLUSION: We suggest that the immunosuppressive treatment with CPA is sometimes necessary to preserve renal function in patients with histologically advanced IgAN.",

        "Abstract":"STUDY OBJECTIVES: To identify demographic and clinical risk factors associated with gastrointestinal (GI) bleeding among a large cohort of patients with atrial fibrillation (AF) who initiated dabigatran therapy for stroke prevention, and to describe patterns of subsequent anticoagulant use after occurrence of the GI bleeding event.\nDESIGN: Retrospective cohort study.\nDATA SOURCES: Large, nationwide United States commercial insurance database.\nPATIENTS: A total of 21,033 patients with nonvalvular AF who initiated dabigatran between October 19, 2010, and December 31, 2012.\nMEASUREMENTS AND MAIN RESULTS: We used multivariate Cox regression analysis to estimate the effect of baseline demographic and clinical characteristics on the probability of a GI bleeding event. Patterns of anticoagulation use after GI bleeding were also examined descriptively. Of the 21,033 patients receiving dabigatran, 446 (2.1%) experienced a GI bleed during follow-up. GI bleeding rates differed across many baseline characteristics. Male sex was associated with a lower risk (adjusted hazard ratio [aHR] 0.78, 95% confidence interval [CI] 0.64-0.95) of GI bleeding. Compared with patients younger than 55 years, those aged 55-64, 65-74, and 75 years or older yielded aHRs of 1.54 (95% CI 0.89-2.68), 2.72 (95% CI 1.59-4.65), and 4.52 (95% CI 2.68-7.64), respectively. Renal impairment (aHR 1.67, 95% CI 1.24-2.25), heart failure (aHR 1.25, 95% CI 1.01-1.56), alcohol abuse (aHR 2.57, 95%CI 1.52-4.35), previous Helicobacter pylori infection (aHR 4.75, 95% CI 1.93-11.68), antiplatelet therapy (aHR 1.49, 95% CI 1.19-1.88), and digoxin use (aHR 1.49, 95% CI 1.19-1.88) were also associated with an increased GI bleeding risk. Of the 446 patients who experienced a GI bleed, 193 (43.3%) restarted an anticoagulant, with most (65.8%) filling prescriptions for dabigatran; the mean time was 50.4 days until restarting any subsequent anticoagulant.\nCONCLUSION: The risk of GI bleeding in patients receiving dabigatran is highly associated with increased age and cardiovascular, renal, and other comorbidities, even after adjusting for other factors. Fewer than 50% of patients restarted an anticoagulant after experiencing a GI bleed. Clinicians should continue to monitor for these risk factors or consider whether alternative therapies may be appropriate.",

The aim of this study was to compare the incidence and magnitude of hemodynamic changes in preeclamptic and non-preeclamptic parturients undergone Cesarean section under spinal anesthesia.\nMETHOD: A prospective cohort study was conducted from 01 February to 28 May 2019 in preeclamptic and non-preeclamptic parturients. We hypothesized preeclamptic parturients are at high risk of spinal anesthesia induced hypotension than non preeclamptics. A total of 122 ASA II and ASA III parturients were recruited consecutively and assigned to two groups (81non-preeclamptics, and 41 preeclamptics). Parturients with cardiac disease, twin pregnancy, chronic hypertension, gestational hypertension, superimposed hypertension, renal disease, diabetes mellitus, coagulopathy (platelet count < 80 × 10\/L), active labor, eclampsia, abruptio placentae, placenta praevia, any adjuvant added with local anesthetics were excluded. The data analysis was done using SPSS version 22 statistical software. Student t test, MannWhitney U test and Fisher exact test were used to compare the data. All  values < 0.05 were considered statistically significant.\nRESULT: The incidence of spinal anesthesia-induced hypotension was higher in non-preeclamptic parturients than preeclamptic parturients (55.6% vs. 34.1%, respectively) and the degree of blood pressure drop was significantly greater in the non-preeclamptic parturients compared to those with preeclampsia; As well intraoperative fluid consumption was significantly greater in the non-preeclamptics parturients compared to those with preeclamptics.\nCONCLUSION: The incidence and magnitude of spinal anesthesia-induced hypotension in parturients undergone Cesarean section were less in preeclamptic parturients than in non-preeclamptic parturients..

        "Published":null,
        "Abstract":"BACKGROUND: Renal side effects of nonsteroidal anti-inflammatory drugs (NSAIDs) are acute renal failure due to an impaired perfusion caused by inhibition of prostaglandin synthesis, acute allergic interstitial nephritis as well as acute toxic tubular necrosis. Moreover, chronic renal failure may occur due to a chronic interstitial nephritis or an analgesic nephropathy that is characterized by capillary sclerosis and papillary necrosis in addition to chronic interstitial nephritis. In contrast to acute renal insufficiency that may already occur after a single NSAID dose, analgesic nephropathy is a disease caused by long-term intake of NSAID compound analgesics and predominantly affects the middle and old age.\nCASE REPORT: An 18-year-old patient with a 4-year history of NSAID compound analgesic intake presented to the urology department with right-sided flank pain and increased serum creatinine. An obstruction as well as nephrolithiasis were ruled out and the patient was referred to the medical department. Urinalysis showed leukocyturia, mild microhematuria as well as proteinuria of 2.2 g\/day whereupon a diagnostic kidney biopsy was performed. Histology revealed a chronic nonpurulent destructive interstitial nephritis. After cessation of analgesic intake, the serum creatinine level fell to the normal range; however, a reduced creatinine clearance persisted indicating chronic renal damage.\nCONCLUSION: The present case is remarkable in that chronic renal damage due to intake of a compound analgesic was already observed in an 18-year-old patient. In this context, the permission of NSAID compound analgesics and their free over-the-counter sale to adolescents need to be critically questioned.",

        "Published":null,
        "Abstract":"The interaction of pregnancy and the rheumatic diseases varies, ranging from life-threatening conditions such as thromboembolic events and progressive renal disease in some autoimmune disorders, to minor flares of peripheral arthritis in inflammatory rheumatic disease. As a consequence, treatment strategy will vary according to the maternal or fetal compromise expected. All nonsteroidal anti-inflammatory drugs (NSAIDs), including high dose aspirin (acetylsalicylic acid), can cause adverse effects during pregnancy related to the inhibition of prostaglandin synthesis. Prolongation of gestation and labour, constriction of the ductus arteriosus, persistent fetal circulation, impairment of renal function and bleeding are risks of third trimester exposure of pregnant women to all inhibitors of cyclo-oxygenase. Most of these adverse effects can be prevented by discontinuing NSAIDs 8 weeks prior to delivery. Low dose aspirin has not been associated with fetal or neonatal toxicity. Some corticosteroids such as prednisone and prednisolone do not readily cross the placenta and can be safely used during pregnancy as immunosuppressive drugs. Maternal complications related to corticosteroids may occur and close monitoring is therefore mandatory. There is limited information on the safety of disease-modifying antirheumatic drugs including gold, antimalarials, penicillamine (D-penicillamine), sulfasalazine and cyclosporin. Of these agents, sulfasalazine has the best record for tolerability and can be used by pregnant patients. Gold compounds and penicillamine should be discontinued when pregnancy is recognised. Hydroxychloroquine has not been associated with congenital malformations and seems preferable to chloroquine in patients requiring treatment with antimalarials. Use of cyclosporin may be an alternative to other therapy in pregnant patients with severe rheumatic disease. Indications for treatment with colchicine during pregnancy are few, except for familial Mediterranean fever. Azathioprine can be used when the maternal condition requires a cytotoxic drug during the first trimester. Cyclophosphamide, chlorambucil and methotrexate are contraindicated during pregnancy because of their teratogenic potential. Their use may be considered in late pregnancy if the mother has a life-threatening condition.",

This is most apparent in kidney cancer, where laparoscopic radical nephrectomy is now considered to be a gold standard. Herein, we compared early postoperative morbidity in a contemporary series of open and laparoscopic radical nephrectomies. We reviewed all patients that underwent a radical nephrectomy between October 1999 and May 2001 at our institution. We then compared open radical nephrectomy patients to those undergoing laparoscopic approaches with specific attention to early complications. A total of 74 radical nephrectomies were performed: 41 open, 18 hand-assisted and 15 pure laparoscopic nephrectomies. Overall, complication rates between the open, hand-assist and pure laparoscopic groups were similar (10%, 17% and 12%, respectively, P = 0.133). There was no statistically significant difference in ASA score (P = 0.144), pre-operative hematocrit (P = 0.575) or intra-operative blood loss (P = 0.364). The open nephrectomy group had a statistically larger average tumor size (7.4 cm vs. 4.6 cm; P = 0.005) and younger average age (57 vs. 63; P = 0.019) than the laparoscopic group. Length of hospital stay was significantly shorter in the laparoscopic group (3.6 days vs. 1.7 days; P < 0.0001). Laparoscopic radical nephrectomy has an acceptably low complication rate and compares favorably to open radical nephrectomy.

TREATMENT SCHEDULE: Olsalazine 500 mg twice daily for 7 days and mesalazine 500 mg thrice daily for 7 days consecutively.\nPATIENTS: Fifteen patients (12 males\/3 females) aged between 18-70 years with ulcerative colitis in endoscopically confirmed remission for at least one month.\nMETHODS: A morning predose plasma sample and a 24-h urine collection on days 6 and 7 of each course were obtained from all patients for quantitative determination of 5-ASA and acetyl-5-ASA (Ac-5-ASA) concentrations. High performance liquid chromatography was used and all analyses were performed blindly on coded samples.\nRESULTS: Treatment with mesalazine compared with olsalazine gave significantly higher levels of 5-ASA and Ac-5-ASA in plasma and urine. Maximum values and ranges of all variables were higher in the mesalazine group than in the olsalazine group. It is noteworthy that there was clear discriminance in the range of urine 5-ASA and Ac-5-ASA concentrations after mesalazine and olsalazine treatment.\nCONCLUSION: 1. The mesalazine preparation used, in comparison with olsalazine given in usual dosages, causes significantly higher levels of 5-ASA and Ac-5-ASA in plasma and urine in patients with inactive ulcerative colitis. 2. The lower systemic load of 5-ASA may reduce the potential risk of adverse events and in particular of nephrotoxicity.",

        "Abstract":"BACKGROUND: In patients ≥80 years of age, the use of second-generation cobalt-chromium everolimus-eluting stents (CoCr-EES) versus bare-metal stents has been shown to reduce myocardial infarction (MI) and target vessel revascularization (TVR) rates, without an increase in bleeding. However, safety and efficacy of CoCr-EES in octogenarians compared to younger populations are less certain. We aimed to compare the clinical outcomes between octogenarian and non-octogenarian patients undergoing percutaneous coronary intervention (PCI) with CoCr-EES.\nMETHODS: We retrospectively analyzed 186 patients treated with CoCr-EES; 54 octogenarians (63 lesions) and 132 non-octogenarians (152 lesions). The primary endpoint was a 1-year composite of all-cause death, MI, TVR, cerebrovascular accident (CVA), or major bleeding. Stent thrombosis (ST) was also evaluated.\nRESULTS: Radial approach was used in 70.4% of octogenarians versus 80.3% of non-octogenarians (p = 0.18). Rates of dual antiplatelet therapy at 1 year were 90.7% for octogenarians and 90.9% for non-octogenarians (p = 1.00). The primary endpoint occurred in 14.8% of octogenarians and 11.4% of non-octogenarians (p = 0.52). There were no significant differences with respect to the rates of 1-year all-cause death (7.4% vs. 3.8%, p = 0.30), MI (1.9% vs. 1.5%, p = 1.00), TVR (3.7% vs. 5.3%, p = 0.65), CVA (1.9% vs. 2.3%, p = 1.00), and definite\/probable ST (1.9% vs. 1.5%, p = 1.00) between the 2 groups. Major bleeding was observed in only 1 of octogenarians. Multivariate analysis demonstrated that chronic kidney disease and intravascular ultrasound use were the only independent predictors of the primary endpoint.\nCONCLUSIONS: According to our series, 1-year safety and efficacy outcomes of CoCr-EES PCI in octogenarians were comparable to those in non-octogenarians.\nSUMMARY: We compared the clinical outcomes between octogenarian and non-octogenarian patients treated with second-generation cobalt-chromium everolimus-eluting stents (CoCr-EES). In our series, 1-year safety and efficacy outcomes of CoCr-EES percutaneous coronary intervention in octogenarians were similar to those in younger counterparts.",

        "Abstract":"Non-steroidal anti-inflammatory drugs (NSAIDs) and selective cyclooxygenase-2 inhibitors (Coxibs) are commonly used for minor pain treatment and chronically in the management of rheumatoid arthritis and osteoarthritis. Three areas of safety concerns are shared by both groups of drugs: Gastrointestinal complications (upper gastrointestinal bleeding, perforations or obstruction), cardiovascular safety (mainly myocardial infarction) and renal safety (acute renal failure, hypertension and electrolyte abnormalities). The incidence of renal complications may be increased two-fold with NSAIDs or coxibs, and there is no evidence for a major difference between the two groups of drugs. Coxibs are clearly associated with improved gastrointestinal safety compared to NSAIDs, but this benefit is reduced and may be lost completely with concurrent low-dose aspirin use. In contrast, coxibs may be associated with a greater incidence of cardiovascular complications, mainly myocardial infarction, especially in comparison to certain NSAIDs such as naproxen. Thus, coxibs are not generally safer than NSAIDs. Rather, their long-term use should be customized to individual patients and their intrinsic baseline risks and other medications required in their management.",

        "Abstract":"OBJECTIVE: To evaluate the clinical effect and safety of regional citrate anticoagulation (RCA) in continuous renal replacement therapy (CRRT) for acute kidney injury (AKI) after hepatectomy.\nMETHODS: A retrospective analysis of the clinical data of all patients with AKI after hepatectomy for CRRT admitted to surgical intensive care unit (ICU) of the First Affiliated Hospital of Xi'an Jiaotong University from January 19th, 2013 to January 19th, 2018 was performed. According to the different anticoagulants, the patients were divided into no anticoagulant group (NA group), low molecular heparin anticoagulation (LMHA) group and RCA group. The general data of patients during the perioperative period; renal function, the internal environment, electrolyte and blood coagulation function before and after CRRT; the filter time, the number of filters and adverse events (bleeding, frequent filter blood coagulation, metabolic alkalosis, metabolic acidosis, hypocalcemia, citrate accumulation, etc.) during CRRT were collected. Kaplan-Meier survival curve was used to analyze the life span of the first filter during different anticoagulation.\nRESULTS: A total of 67 cases were included in this study, including 11 in the NA group, 25 in the LMHA group and 31 in the RCA group. There was no significant difference in gender, age, underlying disease, etiology (tumor), Child-Pugh stage (A or B), CT angiography (CTA), basic renal function [serum creatinine (SCr), cystatin C (Cys C)], the American Society of Anesthesiologists (ASA) stage; surgical approach; intraoperative bleeding volume, blood transfusion, blood pressure, time of duration of low blood pressure; and postoperative circulatory failure, hepatic insufficiency and sepsis among three groups. However, the length of ICU stay in RCA group was significantly less than the LMHA group and NA group (days: 8.16±2.24 vs. 10.48±5.11, 13.29±6.64, both P < 0.05). Compared with before CRRT, the levels of SCr, Cys C and Lac were significantly decreased in RCA group and LMHA group after CRRT [SCr (μmol\/L): 89.02±21.90 vs. 248.30±55.32, 105.10±49.00 vs. 270.10±156.00; Cys C (mg\/L): 2.18±0.95 vs. 2.94±1.26, 2.26±0.76 vs. 3.07±0.90; Lac (mmol\/L): 2.21±1.46 vs. 3.62±1.73, 2.37±1.24 vs. 4.03±1.69, all P < 0.05]; in addition, LMHA group and NA group had significant effects on hemoglobin (Hb), platelet count (PLT) and activated partial thromboplastin time (APTT) after CRRT [Hb (g\/L): 85.4±5.1 vs. 99.6±23.6, 80.0±7.6 vs. 101.4±7.8; PLT (×10\/L): 27.60±8.22 vs. 62.04±16.49, 21.36±3.91 vs. 61.45±17.69; APTT (s): 63.07±10.25 vs. 41.52±3.65, 49.56±5.77 vs. 41.09±3.45, all P < 0.05]; at the same time, Cys C level and prothrombin time (PT) in the NA group after CRRT treatment were significantly increased compared with the others [Cys C (mg\/L): 3.59±0.64 vs. 2.29±0.51, PT (s): 26.41±2.43 vs. 23.64±1.92 , both P < 0.05]. Finally, the time of filters (hours: 60.52±8.82, 31.04±7.03, 13.73±6.26, F = 183.412, P < 0.001) and the number of filter during treatment (number: 2.03±0.60, 3.12±0.73, 4.64±1.29, F = 45.933, P < 0.001) in the RCA group, LMHA group and NA group had statistically significant difference. Meanwhile, the incidence of adverse events such as bleeding (0 vs. 4, 7, χ  = 23.961, P < 0.001) and frequent filter coagulation (1 vs. 10, 11, χ  = 35.413, P < 0.001) in RCA group was significantly lower than that in LMHA group and NA group. Kaplan-Meier survival analysis showed that the life time of the first filter in RCA group was significantly longer than that in LMHA group and NA group (χ = 139.45, P < 0.05).\nCONCLUSIONS: The application of RCA in patients with AKI after hepatectomy during CRRT is safe and effective, which can significantly prolong the life of the filter and reduce the risk of bleeding.",

The objectives of the study were to examine the temporal trends and patient characteristics associated with prescription of thrombolytic, antithrombotic and statin medications among patients with first-ever stroke.\nMATERIALS AND METHODS: First-ever ischaemic and haemorrhagic stroke patients admitted to 2 Singapore tertiary hospitals between 2010‒2014 were included. Data were extracted from the National Healthcare Group Chronic Disease Management System. Association between drug utilisation and admission year, as well as characteristics associated with drug use, were explored using multivariable logistic regression.\nRESULTS: There was an increasing trend in the combined use of all 3 guideline medications in ischaemic stroke patients ( <0.001)-specifically thrombolytic agents ( <0.001), oral antithrombotics ( = 0.002) and statins ( = 0.003) at discharge. Among antithrombotics, the use of clopidogrel ( <0.001) and aspirin-clopidogrel ( <0.001) had increased, whereas prescription of dipyridamole ( <0.001) and aspirin-dipyridamole ( <0.001) had declined. For statins, the increase in atorvastatin prescription ( <0.001) was accompanied by decreasing use of simvastatin ( <0.001). Age, ethnicity and certain comorbidities (hyperlipidaemia, atrial fibrillation and chronic kidney disease) were associated with the combined use of all 3 guideline medications ( <0.05). In haemorrhagic stroke, prescription of statins at discharge were comparatively lower.\nCONCLUSION: This study reveals changes in prescription behaviour over time in a multiethnic Asian population with first-ever stroke. Patient characteristics including younger age, Malay ethnicity and certain comorbidities (i.e. hyperlipidaemia, atrial fibrillation) were associated with the combined use of all 3 guideline medications among ischaemic stroke patients.",

        "Published":"2022-04-29",
        "Abstract":"BACKGROUND: Acute interstitial nephritis (AIN) is an important cause of kidney injury accounting for up to 27% of unexplained renal impairment. In up to 70% of cases, drugs, including aminosalicylates, are reported as the underlying cause. Following two recent paediatric cases of suspected mesalazine induced AIN within our own department, we performed a systematic review of the literature to address the following question: In patients with inflammatory bowel disease (IBD), is interstitial nephritis associated with 5-aminosalicylate (5-ASA) treatment? Our primary objective was to identify the number of cases reported in the literature of biopsy-proven 5-ASA induced interstitial nephritis, in children and adults with IBD. We also aimed to identify which variables influence the onset, severity and recovery of 5-ASA interstitial nephritis.\nMETHODS: Embase and PubMed databases were searched from inception to 07\/10\/20. Search terms had three main themes: \"inflammatory bowel disease\", \"interstitial nephritis\" and \"aminosalicylates\". Studies were included if they reported an outcome of AIN, confirmed on biopsy, suspected to be secondary to a 5-ASA drug in those with IBD. A narrative synthesis was performed.\nRESULTS: Forty-one case reports were identified. Mesalazine was the most frequently reported aminosalicylate associated with AIN (95%). The median duration of treatment before AIN was diagnosed was 2.3 years (Interquartile Range (IQR) 12-48 months). The median rise in creatinine was 3.3 times the baseline measurement (IQR 2.5-5.5). Aminosalicylate withdrawal and steroids were the most frequently used treatments. Despite treatment, 15% of patients developed end-stage renal failure.\nCONCLUSIONS: AIN is a serious adverse drug reaction associated with aminosalicylates, with mesalazine accounting for most reports. The current guidance of annual monitoring of renal function may not be sufficient to identify cases early. Given the severity of AIN and reports in the literature that early treatment with steroids may be beneficial, we would recommend at least 6 monthly monitoring of renal function.

        "Abstract":"PURPOSE: To assess periprocedural results and secondary endovascular procedure outcomes over 5 years in patients aged ≥80 vs <80 years undergoing endovascular aneurysm repair (EVAR).\nMATERIALS AND METHODS: Data from the Endurant Stent Graft Natural Selection Global post-market registry (ENGAGE) were used for the analyses. A total of 1263 consecutive patients were enrolled in the prospective, observational, single-arm registry and divided into 2 groups according to age: ≥80 years (290, 22.9%) and <80 years (973, 77.1%). Baseline patient characteristics, risk scores according to the Society for Vascular Surgery (SVS) reporting standards, American Society of Anesthesiologists (ASA) classification, quality of life assessments [EuroQol 5 (EQ5D) index], and treatment outcomes, including all-cause mortality, aneurysm-related mortality, major adverse events, secondary endovascular procedures, and endoleaks were compared between groups.\nRESULTS: Octogenarians were classified into the highest category of the SVS risk stratification system; however, this did not result in a significant difference in the 30-day mortality [1.4% (4\/290) vs 1.2% (12\/973) for controls; p=0.85] or major adverse event rates [5.2% (15\/290) vs 3.6% (35\/973), p=0.23]. Multivariable analysis confirmed that age ≥80 years, pulmonary disease, large aneurysm diameter, and renal insufficiency were significantly associated with all-cause mortality, whereas diameter was the only parameter associated with increased aneurysm-related mortality. The differences in freedom from secondary endovascular procedures over 5 years between octogenarians and controls did not reach statistical significance (88.5% vs 83.2%, p=0.07).\nCONCLUSION: EVAR can be performed in individuals aged ≥80 years with no statistically significant difference in midterm aneurysm-related deaths compared with younger patients. The findings in this elderly patient cohort show that EVAR can be safely performed with acceptable morbidity rates in octogenarians.",

        "Published":null,
        "Abstract":"Until recently, nonsteroidal anti-inflammatory drugs (NSAIDs) were regarded as weak analgesic agents with a potent antiplatelet effect that severely limited their perioperative usefulness. However, the recent development of injectable NSAIDs has stimulated a re-evaluation of the potential role of this class of drugs in postoperative pain management. In general surgery, NSAIDs have been shown to be effective analgesics when administered after surgery, as judged by either a reduction in pain scores and\/or by an opioid sparing effect. Parenteral NSAIDs alone, notably ketorolac and diclofenac, may be adequate or even preferred analgesic agents after minor surgery. In dental surgery, NSAIDs produce greater initial analgesia than steroids, although the latter produce greater suppression of swelling and less functional loss. NSAID pretreatment results in only modest suppression of swelling compared with placebo. These data suggest that the acute analgesic effects of NSAIDs in oral surgery and probably other models result from suppression of a nociceptive process, rather than a generalised anti-inflammatory effect. This view challenges the traditional association between inhibition of prostaglandin synthesis and the therapeutic effects of these drugs. The variety of NSAIDs leads to a range in half-lives from short, e.g. diclofenac (1 h), intermediate, e.g. ketorolac (5h), to long, e.g. tenoxicam (60h), which has implications for both convenience of the dosage regimen and drug accumulation. For some racemic NSAIDs (e.g. ibuprofen), metabolic 'activation' of the inactive R-enantiomer to the active S-enantiomer occurs. Renal dysfunction may increase both the plasma concentration and body residence time of NSAIDs, thereby increasing the risk of adverse effects. The concomitant effects of anaesthesia have not yet been studied. The principal concern regarding the use of perioperative NSAIDs is the risk of decreased haemostasis and wound healing. Although it has been found that NSAIDs prolong bleeding times in patients, values generally remain below the upper limits of those in generally healthy patients. Healing of gastrointestinal anastomoses may be compromised by NSAID administration but corneal healing and bone remodelling are not. There is a need for further research into the potential for renal side effects with NSAIDs in the perioperative setting, where the effects of anaesthesia and surgery may increase the risk of side effects, particularly in elderly patients. The main benefits of NSAIDs derive from opioid sparing (e.g. reduction in perioperative nausea and vomiting and improvement in ventilation), although some studies allude to an enhanced quality of analgesia from the combination compared with either NSAID or opioid alone. The question of pre- vs postinjury treatment with NSAIDs remains unresolved.",

        "Abstract":"OBJECTIVE: A pharmacodynamic interaction between clopidogrel and proton pump inhibitors (PPIs) has been suggested, leading to reduced clopidogrel-induced platelet inhibitory effects. However, data from clinical studies are conflicting. The aim of this study was to evaluate the safety of long-term clopidogrel and PPI therapy.\nMETHODS: A total of 1328 consecutive patients (age 63±11 years; 81% male) undergoing drug-eluting stent implantation and 1-year follow-up were included. All patients were treated with a standard aspirin and clopidogrel treatment regimen for 12 months. The concomitant PPI therapy for the same duration was at the discretion of the clinical cardiologist. PPI therapy included lansoprazole (30 mg\/day), pantoprazole (20 mg\/day), or omeprazole (20 mg\/day). At 1-year follow-up, major adverse cardiac events (MACE), defined as death, myocardial infarction (MI), acute coronary syndrome leading to hospitalization and nonfatal stroke, were recorded. All cause death, any stent thrombosis (ST), and bleeding (Thrombolysis in MI major and minor) were also assessed.\nRESULTS: Lansoprazole, pantoprazole, and omeprazole were administered to 855, 178, and 125 patients, whereas 170 were not prescribed any PPI therapy. Among patients treated with PPIs, those on pantoprazole had more often prior MI, multivessel coronary artery disease, and chronic kidney disease, whereas earlier peptic ulcer was more frequent among patients treated with omeprazole. The incidence of 1-year MACE was not statistically different between patients in the PPI and no-PPI groups (7.5 vs. 5.0%; P=0.26). Similarly, 1-year rates of all cause death, ST, and Thrombolysis in MI major and minor bleedings did not significantly differ. After statistical adjustment for potential confounders, the concomitant use of clopidogrel and PPIs was not associated with the risk of 1-year MACE [odds ratio (OR) 1.54, P=0.38], death (OR: 0.97, P=0.961), and ST (OR: 1.01, P=0.998). No differences across the three PPI types were found.\nCONCLUSION: The association of clopidogrel and PPIs after drug-eluting stent implantation, prescribed on clinical judgement, seems safe.",

Improperly controlled pain leads to agitation, tachycardia, hypertension and increases risk of respiratory complications. Many studies have demonstrated good analgetic effect of morphine delivered by the method of patient controlled analgesia (PCA). Because the intensity of postoperative pain in end-stage kidney insufficiency patients can be modified by the type of received anaesthesia, it was decided to analyze the influence of standardized general anaesthesia on postoperative morphine consumption. 140 (ASA III) patients scheduled for kidney transplantation were included. Patients were divided into four groups; group K (control)--anaesthetised with fentanyl and N2O, group 1--fentanyl, N2O plus halothane, group 2--fentanyl, N2O plus propofol, group 3--fentanyl, N2O plus isoflurane. After operation and initial loading dose, PCA infusion of morphine was started. Bolus doses were set to 30 ug\/kg, and lockout interval 10 min. Our results suggest that observed greater morphine consumption after GA with the use of propofol is connected with better psychomotor functions. In that group patients were better oriented and more efficiently controlled the PCA pump and pain.",

        "Published":"2019-04-25",
        "Abstract":"BACKGROUND: An increased incidence of thromboembolic events (TE) are reported in nephrotic syndrome (NS) leading to recommendations for prophylactic anticoagulation (PAC). However, as no randomized clinical trial has established the efficacy or risks associated with PAC, guidelines are empiric or substantiated only by estimates of risks and benefits. This study evaluates the risk of TE and hemorrhagic complications in patients with NS treated with PAC and compares to patients not receiving PAC.\nMETHODS: We included patients diagnosed with NS from two Danish nephrology departments with different practices for the use of PAC. Patients were included if presenting with NS from September 2006 to January 2012, a P-albumin < 30 g\/L, and renal biopsy confirming non-diabetic, glomerular disease. Patients aged < 16 years, on renal replacement therapy, or administered anticoagulants at the onset of NS were excluded. Bleeding episodes and\/or TE were identified from patient records. Bleeding episodes were divided into minor and major bleeding.\nRESULTS: Of the 79 patients included, 44 patients received PAC either as low or high dose low-molecular-weight heparin (LMWH) or as warfarin with or without LMWH as bridging, while 35 did not receive PAC. P-albumin was significant lower in the PAC group compared to those not receiving PAC. Significantly more TEs was observed in the non-PAC group compared to the PAC group (4 versus 0 episodes, P = 0.035). The TEs observed included one patient with pulmonary embolism (PE), one with PE and deep vein thrombosis, one with PE and renal vein thrombosis, and one with a stroke. Five patients with bleeding episodes were identified among those receiving PAC, of which two were major and three were minor, while two patients in the non-PAC group experienced a minor bleeding episode (P = 0.45 between groups). The major bleeding episodes only occurred in patients receiving PAC in combination with low dose aspirin.\nCONCLUSIONS: In patients with NS the use of PAC was associated with a decreased risk of clinically significant TE, but may also be associated with more bleeding episodes although not statistically significant. Only patients treated with PAC in combination with anti-platelet therapy had major bleeding episodes.",

Patients were grouped into age<65 and age≥65 years. The demographic data, surgical outcomes, complication, hospital stay, blood loss, and survival were compared between the two groups.\nRESULTS: A total of 101 patients were included; 74 in the younger group, and 27 in the older group. Compared to the young group, lower BMI, higher anemia, higher ASA grade, and comorbidities were frequent in the elderly. The operative time, blood loss, and renal function decline were comparable between two age groups. The complication rates in the older and younger group were 22% and 12%, respectively. The survival time was shorter in older patients compared to the younger ones; hazard ratio 2.25; 95%CI 1.08-4.69, -value=0.031.\nCONCLUSION: Nephrectomy in elderly patients is safe and feasible and preoperative assessment along with diligent postoperative care may further increase survival.

        "Abstract":"BACKGROUND AND AIMS: Catheter-related bladder discomfort (CRBD) causes significant distress to the patient and requires great attention to analgesia and increases morbidity in the postoperative period. This study evaluated the efficacy of intramuscular dexmedetomidine in alleviating CRBD following percutaneous nephrolithotomy (PCNL) and postoperative inflammatory response.\nMATERIAL AND METHODS: A prospective randomized double-blind study was conducted in a tertiary care hospital from December 2019- March 2020. Sixty seven of ASA I and II patients scheduled for elective PCNL were randomized and group I received 1 μg\/kg dexmedetomidine intramuscularly and group II normal saline as control 30 minutes before induction of anesthesia. Standard anesthesia protocol was followed and patients were catheterized with 16 Fr Foleys after induction of anesthesia. Rescue analgesia was paracetamol if the score was moderate. Postoperatively CRBD score and inflammatory markers; total white cell count, erythrocyte sedimentation rate and temperature were noted for 3 days.\nRESULTS: There was a significant low CRBD score in group I. Ramsay sedation score was 2 in group I with p 0.00 and rescue analgesia required was very low with p 0.00. Statistical Package for social Sciences software version 20 was used for analysis. Student ttest, analysis of variance, and Chisquare test were applied for quantitative and qualitative analysis respectively.\nCONCLUSION: Single dose intramuscular dexmedetomidine is effective, simple and safe in preventing the CRBD and the inflammatory response remained uninfluenced except ESR, the reason remains largely unknown.",

        "Abstract":"BACKGROUND: As high healthcare costs are increasing scrutinized, a movement toward reducing patient hospital admissions and lengths of stay has emerged, particularly for operations that may be performed safely in the outpatient setting. Our aim is to describe recent temporal trends in the proportion of dialysis access procedures performed on an inpatient versus outpatient basis and to determine the effects of these changes on perioperative morbidity and mortality.\nMETHODS: The 2005-2008 American College of Surgeons National Surgical Quality Improvement Program database was queried for all primary arteriovenous fistula (AVF) procedures using current procedural terminology codes. Changes in the proportions of inpatient versus outpatient operations performed by year, as well as the associated 30-day postoperative morbidity and mortality, were analyzed using univariable statistics and multivariable logistic regression.\nRESULTS: Two thousand nine hundred fifty AVF procedures were performed over the study period. Overall, 71.7% (n = 2,114) were performed on an outpatient basis. Inpatient procedures were associated with higher 30-day morbidity (10.5% vs. 4.5%) and mortality (2.8% vs. 0.7%) than outpatient procedures (both, P < 0.001). There was a significant increase in the proportion of procedures performed on an outpatient basis over time (2005: 56% vs. 2008: 75%; P < 0.001). There were no changes in postoperative morbidity or mortality for inpatient or outpatient AVF over time (P ≥ 0.36). Independent determinants of having an inpatient procedure included younger age (OR 0.99), increasing ASA class (ASA IV OR 1.56), congestive heart failure (OR 3.32), recent ascites (OR 3.25), poor functional status (OR 3.22), the presence of an open wound (OR 1.91), and recent sepsis (OR 6.06) (all, P < 0.01). Acute renal failure (OR 2.60) and current dialysis (OR 1.44) were also predictive (P < 0.001). After correcting for baseline differences between groups, the adjusted OR for both morbidity (aOR 1.93, 95% CI 1.38-2.69) and mortality (aOR 2.85, 95% CI 1.36-5.95) remained significantly higher for inpatient versus outpatient AVF.\nCONCLUSIONS: Dialysis access operations are increasingly being performed on an outpatient basis, with stable perioperative outcomes. Inpatient procedures are associated with worse outcomes, likely because they are reserved for patients with acute illnesses, serious comorbidities, and poor functional status. Overall, for appropriately selected patients, the movement toward performing more elective dialysis access operations on an outpatient basis is associated with acceptable outcomes.",

In Germany, national guidelines are followed for patients with normal kidney function in addition to the recommendations of Kidney Disease - Improving Global Outcomes (KDIGO) for CKD patients. These guidelines focus on standard of care and include treatment with aspirin, statins, beta-blockers, inhibitors of the renin-angiotensin system, and sodium glucose cotransporters for patients with cardiovascular disease. Revascularization strategies follow a more pragmatic approach for the fragile, comorbid, and aging patient population. Younger patients appear to benefit from surgical interventions. Treatment of acute events is currently administered independent of the patient's kidney function, but there is no consensus yet on the best strategy.

        "Abstract":"BACKGROUND AND AIM: Retrospective evaluation of stroke risk in all patients with atrial fibrillation (AF) admitted to cardiology, internal medicine, and neurology wards in a single Polish district hospital in 2006 and 2010 using two risk stratification schemes, CHADS₂ vs. CHA₂DS₂VASc risk scores and identification of independent predictors of guideline-compliant oral anticoagulant (OAC) treatment.\nMETHODS: We analysed case records of 613 patients with AF (including 300 patients in 2006 and 313 patients in 2010) treated in a district hospital - the John Paul II Western Hospital (Szpital Zachodni) in Grodzisk Mazowiecki, to evaluate their stroke risk and therapy prescribed at discharge.\nRESULTS: The mean patient age in the overall study population (49% of men) was 74.3 years (74.8, 77.5, and 71.9 years, respectively, in patients with paroxysmal, permanent and persistent AF). Patients > 75 years old comprised 58.6% of the study group, and those < 65 years old comprised 16.6% of the study group. The most common concomitant diseases were hypertension (65.9%), chronic heart failure (61.7%), coronary artery disease (43.1%), at least moderate mitral and\/or tricuspid regurgitation (36.4%), and peripheral arterial disease (36%). Indications for OAC treatment were present in 85% (using the CHADS₂ score) or 95% (using the CHA₂DS₂VASc score) patients but this therapy was prescribed at discharge in only 39% of the study group (240 patients). Compared to patients who were not prescribed OAC, those prescribed OAC treatment were younger, more often male, with permanent AF, valvular heart disease, and hypertension. In patients without OAC treatment at discharge, the following conditions were found more frequently than in patients prescribed OAC treatment: paroxysmal AF(49.8% vs. 33.3% in OAC patients), established coronary artery disease (46.1% vs. 38.3%), previous myocardial infarction (27%vs. 18.7%), prior coronary revascularisation (11.2% vs. 6.6%), alcohol abuse (4.2% vs. 0.8%), renal failure (31.6% vs. 21.6%), and stroke or transient ischaemic attack (TIA; 19.3% vs. 12%). In multivariate logistic regression analysis, we identified 5 independent predictive factors associated with prescribing OAC at discharge, including persistent AF vs. paroxysmal AF (odd sratio [OR] = 5.27), permanent AF vs. paroxysmal AF (OR = 1.86), hypertension (OR = 1.50), previous stroke and\/or TIA (OR = 0.59), and age > 75 years vs. < 65 years (OR = 0.53).\nCONCLUSIONS: Despite a high stroke risk as determined by both scores, only 39% of patients received OAC. In the studied population, independent predictors for prescribing OAC at discharge included arterial hypertension (in accordance with the guidelines) and younger patient age, no history of stroke\/TIA, and AF other than paroxysmal. The practice of OAC and\/or antiplatelet therapy use in AF patients discharged from a Polish district hospital was not compliant with the current ESC guidelines either in 2006 or in 2010.",

        "Abstract":"There is evidence that aspirin--and apparently other NSAIDs--may be protective agents against cancer in the gastrointestinal tract. These effects are particularly well documented in the colon and rectum. Even considered in isolation, the observational data regarding colorectal neoplasia are quite strong, and the reality of a protective effect is buttressed by clinical trial data showing that aspirin prevents sporadic adenomas. Furthermore, the NSAIDs sulindac celecoxib have actually led to the regression of existing colorectal polyps in patients with FAP. Clearly, NSAIDs have the potential to suppress carcinogenesis in the large bowel. Observational data suggesting inverse associations of NSAIDs with cancers of the stomach and esophagus have emerged from several case-control studies and a few cohort analyses. In some studies the findings display features often associated with causal relationships, for example decreasing risks with increasing doses or duration of use. Nonetheless, the data currently do not support a secure conclusion that NSAIDs protect against these malignancies. The relevant data are not nearly as extensive as those for the colorectum, and case-control investigation of these upper gastrointestinal sites may be particularly delicate. It is conceivable that early symptoms of cancer (or of pre-invasive lesions) may have discouraged NSAID use in the cancer patients, creating the appearance of a protective association of the drugs with the risk of these malignancies. More extensive observational data particularly from cohort studies would be desirable to confirm the existing findings and clarify the doses and durations of use required for an effect. Clinical trial investigation might also be practical for pre-neoplastic endpoints, or--in carefully selected populations--perhaps with cancer as the focus. There are only relatively limited data available regarding the effect of NSAIDs on cancer of the pancreas. However, the studies that have investigated this malignancy have reported indications that NSAIDs may have a protective effect. The effects of NSAIDs on cancers outside the gastrointestinal tract are not clear. Some investigations suggest that NSAID use, particularly aspirin, is inversely associated with risk of cancers of the breast or ovary, but several well-done studies have not seen these associations, and the observations could have been due to bias or confounding. Findings regarding prostate cancer are similarly conflicting. The urinary tract is one organ system in which several studies have reported an increased cancer risk in association with NSAID use. Nonetheless, the effects remain unclear. There is only limited available information regarding carcinoma of the bladder, and no firm conclusions can be drawn at this point. More extensive data have been generated regarding the effect of NSAIDs--largely salicylates--on renal cell carcinoma or cancer or the renal pelvis and ureter. Although some studies have reported increased risks, there are also findings suggesting no association. It is particularly difficult for observational studies to ascertain with confidence the true effects of aspirin because of the suspected relationship of these cancers with use of phenacetin and perhaps acetaminophen. Further data--particularly from careful and large cohort studies--would be important to clarify these issues. As a body of research, the findings discussed here from epidemiological studies and clinical trials have begun to clarify the effect of NSAIDs on carcinogenesis in various organs in humans. There is clear potential for protective effects at several anatomic sites. Even for the colorectum, however, it is probably premature to now begin to use these drugs widely for cancer prevention. To reach that point, a weighing of the risks and benefits of the drugs needs to be made, together with a judgement regarding the benefits of alternative means of prevention. For colorectal cancer, for example, aspirin may provide only limited benefit over regular colonoscopy [95, 96]. Nonetheless, with the increased understanding of the clinical effects of NSAIDs on cancer, the development of effective chemoprevention with these drugs appears to be a real possibility.",

        "Abstract":"BACKGROUND & AIMS: This study was performed to quantify the risk of renal disease in patients using aminosalicylates (5-ASA).\nMETHODS: Data from the United Kingdom General Practice Research Database were used to estimate the incidence of renal disease in adult patients with inflammatory bowel disease (IBD) or prescription for 5-ASA and in patients without IBD. In a nested case-control analysis, each case of renal disease was matched to 5 controls.\nRESULTS: Among the 19,025 5-ASA users with IBD, 130 patients developed renal disease (incidence rate of 0.17 cases per 100 patients per year). The incidence among patients with IBD but without 5-ASA use was 0.25 and among patients without IBD was 0.08. In the case-control analysis, the crude odds ratio (OR) for renal disease in current 5-ASA users was 1.60 (95% confidence interval [95% CI]: 1.14-2.26); the adjusted OR was 0.86 (95% CI: 0.53-1.41). For recent users, the crude OR was 4.18 (95% CI: 2.59-6.76) and adjusted OR 2.48 (95% CI: 1.33-4.61); for past users (last prescription more than 12 months before), 1.71 (95% CI: 1.09-2.70) and 0.99 (95% CI: 0.55-1.76), respectively. Although the numbers were small, mesalazine and sulfasalazine users had comparable risks (crude OR for current and recent users of OR 2.08 [95% CI: 1.44-3.01] and 1.84 [95% CI: 1.20-2.82], respectively). In only a few records was renal disease attributed to interstitial nephritis or 5-ASA use.\nCONCLUSIONS: Users of 5-ASA have an increased risk of renal disease that may be partly attributable to the underlying disease. Although renal disease is a recognized adverse effect of 5-ASA, the incidence appears to be low and does not appear to be related to either the dose or type of 5-ASA used.",

Platelet and renal formation of thromboxane A2 and the formation of prostaglandin E2 and prostacyclin were evaluated in vivo by quantification of index metabolites in plasma and urine by gas chromatography-mass spectrometry in neonates after maternal LDA (n = 14) and in a control group.\nRESULTS: In the pregnant women, acetylsalicylic acid and salicylic acid concentrations rapidly increased after ingestion of LDA. Acetylsalicylic acid was completely eliminated within 4 hours, whereas salicylic acid was detected with low concentrations at 18 and 21 hours after dosing. In the neonates, acetylsalicylic acid was not detected. Salicylic acid was detected in 1 infant only. Platelet thromboxane A2 formation in the newborn infants was significantly suppressed but recovered within 2 to 3 days after discontinuation of LDA. Renal thromboxane A2 formation and the formation of prostaglandin E2 and prostacyclin were not affected by LDA.\nCONCLUSION: In pregnant women who are treated with LDA, acetylsalicylic acid is not completely inactivated in the portal circulation but reaches the uteroplacental circulation and exerts antiplatelet effects in the fetus and newborn.",

Individual pharmacokinetic parameters were estimated by compartmental modeling (ASA and SA) and by model-independent methods (SUA). ASA parameter values estimated in this study were in agreement with those reported by other authors after administration of higher doses, which confirms the linearity of ASA pharmacokinetics in a broad dose range. On the contrary, both metabolic and renal elimination routes for SA were found to be saturable. The relative changes in SA renal clearance with the dose were more pronounced than those in metabolic clearance. Particularly, there was no statistically significant difference in SA metabolic clearance between 30 and 100 mg doses, indicating the linear kinetics in this dose range. Further increase in the dose resulted in significant decrease in SA metabolic clearance. At the same time, both SA excretion rate constant and fraction excreted significantly diminished across the entire dose range studied. The dependence of SUA renal clearance upon the dose was shown to be complex, reflecting possible saturability of its excretion.",

During spontaneous ventilation, a type of rapid and superficial respiration is observed with a flow volume of 5.3 ml\/kg for an average frequency of 25\/min. The arterial blood gases show slight hypercapnia. Myorelaxation is significant and better than that obtained with halothane. Coming round poses few problems apart from agitation in adolescents. Response to simple orders appears at 13 minutes. Trembling and rigidity occur in 41p. 100 of the cases for 5 to 30 minutes. From the hepatic point of view, no lastin enzyme changes were noted and no renal toxicity was demonstrated. Ethrane appears to be a good anesthetic agent but the few advantages mentioned means that it does not fulfil ideal conditions.",

        "Abstract":"Poisoning is a significant problem in the elderly. The majority of poisonings in older people are unintentional and may result from dementia and confusion, improper use of the product, improper storage or mistaken identities. Depression is also common in the elderly and suicide attempts are more likely to be successful in this age group. The elderly patient's recuperative abilities may be inadequate as a result of numerous factors including impaired hepatic or renal function as well as chronic disease processes. General management of poisoning in the elderly parallels management of younger adults, but it is especially important to ascertain underlying medical conditions and concurrent medications. In most poisonings, activated charcoal and cathartic are sufficient. Haemodialysis or haemoperfusion may be required at lower plasma drug concentrations in elderly patients. While the specific indications for antidotes are the same for all age groups, dosage alterations and precautions may need to be considered in the elderly. Drugs most often implicated in poisonings in the elderly include psychotherapeutic drugs, cardiovascular drugs, analgesics and anti-inflammatory drugs, oral hypoglycaemics and theophylline. Cardiovascular and neurological toxicities occur with overdoses of neuroleptic drugs and, more frequently and severely, with cyclic antidepressants. Patients with pre-existing cardiovascular disease are at particular risk of worsening ischaemic heart disease and congestive heart failure. Benzodiazepines only appear to produce significant toxicity during long term administration or in combination with other CNS depressants. Digoxin can cause both chronic and acute intoxication, most seriously cardiac toxicity including severe ventricular arrhythmias, second or third degree heart block or severe refractory hyperkalaemia. Immune Fab antibody is indicated for the management of digoxin toxicity, although patients dependent on the inotropic effect of digoxin may develop heart failure after digoxin Fab antibody administration. Nitrates can cause toxicity including headache, vomiting, hypotension and tachycardia from excessive sublingual, transdermal or intravenous doses. Conduction disturbances and hypotension occur with overdoses of antihypertensive drugs; these effects are mild with angiotensin converting enzyme (ACE) inhibitors, occasionally severe with beta-blockers and of significant concern with calcium channel antagonists. The elderly commonly use aspirin and other salicylates, are more likely to develop chronic intoxications to these agents, and are more susceptible to severe complications such as pulmonary oedema. Salicylate poisoning, recognition of which is often delayed, should be considered in elderly patients with neurological abnormalities or breathing difficulties, especially in the setting of acid-base abnormalities. The clinical effects of NSAID overdose are mild and usually involve the central nervous system and gastrointestinal tract.(ABSTRACT TRUNCATED AT 400 WORDS)",

        "Abstract":"OBJECTIVE: Carotid endarterectomy (CEA) is the gold standard to prevent a recurrent stroke in symptomatic patients with carotid stenosis. However, in the modern era, the benefit of CEA in asymptomatic octogenarian patients has come into question. This study investigates real-world outcomes of CEA in asymptomatic octogenarians.\nMETHODS: Patients who underwent CEA for asymptomatic carotid stenosis were identified in the American College of Surgeons National Surgical Quality Improvement Program CEA-targeted database from 2012 to 2017. They were stratified into two groups: octogenarians (≥80 years old) and younger patients (<80 years old). The 30-day outcomes evaluated included mortality and major morbidities such as stroke, cardiac events, pulmonary, and renal dysfunction. Multivariable logistic regression was used for data analysis.\nRESULTS: We identified 13,846 patients with asymptomatic carotid stenosis who underwent an elective CEA including 2509 octogenarians and 11,337 younger patients. Octogenarians were more likely to be female and less likely to be diabetic or smokers compared with younger patients. There was no difference in preoperative use of statins or antiplatelet therapy. Examination of 30-day outcomes revealed that octogenarians had slightly higher mortality (1.2% vs 0.5%; odds ratio, 2.1; 95% confidence interval, 1.3-3.4; P < .01), and a higher risk of return to the operating room (3.3% vs 2.3%; odds ratio, 1.4; 95% confidence interval, 1.1-1.9; P = .01). However, there was no difference between octogenarians and younger patients in adverse cardiac events or pulmonary, renal, or wound complications. Twenty-five octogenarian and 138 younger patients suffered from periprocedural stroke at a similar rate (1.0% vs 1.2%; P = .54). Stroke\/death occurred for 51 of 2509 patients (2.0%) in the older group and 184 of 11,337 patients (1.6%) in the younger group, a difference that was not significant (P = .15).\nCONCLUSIONS: The 30-day outcomes of CEA in octogenarians are comparable with those in younger patients. Although the octogenarians had slightly higher mortality than younger patients, the absolute risk of mortality was still low at 1.2%. Therefore, CEA is safe in asymptomatic carotid stenosis in octogenarians. Overall life expectancy and preoperative functional status, rather than age, should be the major determinants in the decision to operate.",

        "Abstract":"BACKGROUND: The combination of glycoprotein (GP) IIb-IIIa inhibition and direct thrombin inhibition (DTI) with bivalirudin (Angiomax, The Medicines Company, Cambridge, Massachusetts) have shown ischemic and hemorrhagic outcomes benefit in coronary interventions and may have similar benefits in percutaneous peripheral interventions (PPI). The high incidence of diabetes, chronic renal disease, platelet dysfunction, hypercoagulability, inflammation and a thrombus-rich environment make a GP IIb-IIIa and DTI combination with tirofiban (Aggrastat Merck and Company, Inc., Whitehouse Station, New Jersey) an attractive anticoagulation strategy in the PPI treatment of critical limb ischemia (CLI).\nMETHODS: Between May 1, 2001 and January 31, 2003, a CLI treatment group of 149 patients received PPI with bivalirudin (0.75 mg per kg bolus with 1.75 mg per kg per hour periprocedural infusion) and tirofiban (10 mcg per kg per minute bolus with 12-hour 0.1 mcg per kg per minute infusion) as an anticoagulation and antiplatelet strategy, and were compared to a matched unfractionated heparin (UFH) control group without GP IIb-IIIa inhibitors. Clinical and hemostasis outcomes were analyzed, including distal embolization (DE).\nRESULTS: Procedural success was 95.9% and 97.3% in the UFH control group and DTI-GP IIb-IIIa group, respectively. Significant differences were observed in the sheath removal time < 2 hours (60.5% UFH group versus 19.4% DTI-GP IIb-IIIa group; p = < 0.0001). Vascular closure devices were used equally in both groups. No statistical significance was observed in major and minor complications, femoral access complications, acute (< 48 hours) or subacute (30 days) vessel thrombosis, and 6-month duplex ultrasound restenosis rate between the DTI-GP IIb-IIIa versus the UFH group. A trend towards statistical significance was observed in the 6-month secondary re-intervention and limb salvage rates (10.7% versus 18.8%; p = 0.0501 and 93.9% versus 88.5%; p = 0.053) in the DTI-GP IIb-IIIa versus the UFH group, respectively. Angiographically relevant DE occurred in 4 of 149 (1.3%) and 8 of 149 (5.4%) of the bivalirudin-tirofiban and UFH groups, respectively.\nCONCLUSION: The combination of DTI with bivalirudin and GP IIb-IIIa inhibition with tirofiban is a safe and feasible alternative anticoagulation and antiplatelet strategy in PPI, and may offer improved clinical and hemostasis outcomes in treating CLI. A larger, prospective randomized trial is warranted.",

Lab studies included complete blood count, serum concentrations of IgG, IgM and IgA. CD3(+), CD4(+), CD8(+), CD19(+) and CD20(+) cell numbers were assayed by flow cytometry and anti-platelet glycoprotein-specific antibodies (GPIIb\/IIIa, GPIb\/IX) were assayed by monoclonal antibody-specific immobilisation of platelet antigens (MAIPA) prior to and following rituximab therapy. The response was evaluated according to the response criteria of international working group of ITP.\nRESULTS: Complete responses were achieved in 12 cases, response in 7 cases, and no response in 12 cases.

        "Abstract":"BACKGROUND: Over-the-counter (OTC) drug and herbal therapies (HT) may worsen heart failure or interact with prescription medications. Frequency of and predictors for routine OTC drug and HT use are not well studied.\nMETHODS AND RESULTS: We examined routine use of OTC drug and HT in patients at 8 medical centers. Medical conditions independently associated with use of OTC drugs, HT, or both were assessed using multivariable logistic regression models. Of 374 subjects, OTC drug and HT were routinely used by 349 and 43 patients, respectively. Mean age was 69.6 +\/- 13.1 years, 63% were male, and 81% were Caucasian. Common OTC drugs were antiplatelets (baby-dose aspirin), vitamins, acetaminophen, antacids, laxatives, and calcium. The most common HT used was echinacea. History of hypercholesterolemia was associated with higher OTC drug use (OR 4.36; 95% CI 1.60-11.87; P = .004); renal failure predicted less use (OR 0.09; 95% CI 0.01-0.59; P = .013).

The aim of the study was to compare (1) maintenance of anaesthesia and (2) how rapidly and easily the patients emerge from the anaesthetic and recover.\nMETHODS: Outpatients were included who underwent scheduled surgical procedures of an anticipated duration of up to 3 h and an anticipated length of hospitalization of less than 24 h post-anaesthesia. Five hundred patients were randomly selected to receive either sevoflurane (n = 247) or isoflurane (n = 253), each administered with oxygen (30-50%) in nitrous oxide. Efficacy was evaluated through the measurement of times of recovery parameters and tests like the objective pain-discomfort scale, the visual analogue scale, and the digit symbol substitution test. Safety was evaluated by monitoring adverse experience, clinical laboratory and non-laboratory testing and physical assessments.\nRESULTS: No statistical differences were observed between the two treatment groups with respect to demographics and ASA class. All study drug concentrations during each anaesthetic phase were statistically lower in the sevoflurane (average concentration 0.61 MAC) compared to the isoflurane (average concentration 0.70 MAC) group. The mean time to emergence was statistically shorter in the sevoflurane group (8.2 min) than in the isoflurane group (9.3 min). The mean time to response to commands (8.5 min vs 9.8 min) and the mean time to orientation (10.6 min vs 13.0 min) were also statistically shorter in the sevoflurane than in the isoflurane group. The EEG results showed a faster decrease in delta activity and a faster increase in alpha activity in the sevoflurane group than in the isoflurane group, indicating faster awakening. No statistical differences were observed between the two treatment groups for the mean time to any of the remaining post-anaesthesia events. Bradycardia was observed in a statistcally higher percentage of patients in the sevoflurane group (6%) than in the isoflurane group (2%). No other statistical differences were observed between the two treatment groups concerning the incidence of study drug-related adverse experience. The most common adverse experiences were nausea and vomiting. At all post-anaesthesia time points, higher serum inorganic fluoride concentrations were observed in the sevoflurane (maximum 30.2 mumol\/l) than in the isoflurane group. No clinical or laboratory renal insufficiency was noted. Eighty-seven percent of patients in the sevoflurane group would request the same anaesthetic technique compared to only 79% of patients in the isoflurane group.\nCONCLUSIONS: Sevoflurane was as safe as isoflurane for anaesthesia in adult outpatients. Patients who received sevoflurane had statistically significantly shorter recovery parameters than isoflurane patients.",

        "Abstract":"INTRODUCTION: Modified fluid gelatin 4% is approved for use in children, but there is still a surprising lack of clinical studies including large numbers of pediatric patients. Therefore, we performed a European prospective noninterventional multicenter study to evaluate the use of a modified fluid gelatin 4% in saline (sal-GEL) or an acetate-containing balanced electrolyte solution (bal-GEL) in children undergoing major pediatric surgery.\nAIMS: The primary aim was to assess the indications and dosing of modified fluid gelatin, and the secondary aim was to assess the safety and efficacy, focusing, in particular, on routinely collected clinical parameters.\nMETHODS: Children aged up to 12 years with ASA risk scores of I-III receiving sal-GEL or bal-GEL were followed perioperatively. Demographic data, surgical procedures performed, anesthesia, hemodynamic and laboratory data, adverse events, and adverse drug reactions were documented using a standardized case report form.\nRESULTS: 601 children that were investigated at 13 European pediatric centers from May 2015 to March 2020 (sal-GEL 20.1%, bal-GEL 79.9%; mean age 29.1 ± 38.6 (range 0-144) months; body weight 12.1 ± 10.5 (1.4-70) kg) were included in the analysis. The most frequent indications for GEL infusion were hemodynamic instability without bleeding (76.0%), crystalloids alone not being sufficient for hemodynamic stabilization (55.7%), replacement of preoperative deficit (26.0%), and significant bleeding (13.0%). Mean infused GEL volume was 13.0 ± 5.3 (2.4-37.5) ml kg . The total dose was affected by age, with higher doses in younger patients. After gelatin infusion, mean arterial pressure increased (mean change 8.5 ± 7.3 [95% CI: 8 to 9.1] mmHg), and the hemoglobin concentrations decreased significantly (mean change -1.1 ± 1.8 [95% CI: -1.2 to -0.9] g·dL ). Acid-base parameters were more stable with bal-GEL. No serious adverse drug reactions directly related to gelatin (i.e., anaphylactoid reaction, clotting disorders, and renal failure) were observed.\nCONCLUSION: Moderate doses up to 20 ml kg of modified fluid gelatin were infused most frequently to improve hemodynamic stability in children undergoing major pediatric surgery. The acid-base balance was more stable when gelatin in a balanced electrolyte solution was used instead of saline. No serious adverse drug reactions associated with gelatin were observed.",

        "Abstract":"BACKGROUND: Postoperative acute kidney injury (AKI) is a serious complication that is associated with prolonged hospital stay, high risk of short-term postsurgical mortality, need for dialysis, and possible progression to chronic kidney disease. To date, very little data exist on the risk of postoperative AKI among children undergoing noncardiac surgical procedures. We used data from a large multicenter cohort to determine the factors associated with AKI among children who underwent inpatient noncardiac surgical procedures and its impact on the postoperative course.\nMETHODS: We utilized the National Surgical Quality Improvement Program Pediatric participant user files to identify a cohort of children who underwent inpatient surgery between 2012 and 2018 (n = 257,439). We randomly divided the study population into a derivation cohort of 193,082 (75%) and a validation cohort of 64,357 (25%), and constructed a multivariable logistic regression model to identify independent risk factors for AKI. We defined AKI as the occurrence of either acute renal failure or progressive renal insufficiency within the 30 days after surgery.\nRESULTS: The overall rate of postoperative AKI was 0.10% (95% confidence interval [CI], 0.09-0.11). In a multivariable model, operating times longer than 140 minutes, preexisting hematologic disorder, and preoperative sepsis were the strongest independent predictors of AKI. Other independent risk factors for AKI were American Society of Anesthesiologists (ASA) physical status ≥III, preoperative inotropic support, gastrointestinal disease, ventilator dependency, and corticosteroid use. The 30-day mortality rate was 10.1% in children who developed AKI and 0.19% in their counterparts without AKI ( P < .001). Children who developed AKI were more likely to require an extended hospital stay (≥75th percentile of the study cohort) relative to their peers without AKI (77.4% vs 21.0%; P < .001).\nCONCLUSIONS: Independent preoperative risk factors for AKI in children undergoing inpatient noncardiac surgery were hematologic disorder, preoperative sepsis, ASA physical status ≥III, inotropic support, gastrointestinal disease, ventilator dependency, and steroid use. Children with AKI were 10 times more likely to die and nearly 3 times more likely to require an extended hospital stay, relative to their peers without AKI.",

Wallace et al. (1977). The patients were divided into 2 groups: 1) 51 patients aged over 60 years; 2) 49 patients aged less than 60 years. In Groups 1 and 2, the mean age at gout onset was 66.1 +\/- 4.8 and 41.6 +\/- 10.0 years, respectively. A comparative retrospective analysis was made to analyze the detection rate for the site of onset gout, the pattern of arthritis, the number of tophus forms, the use of diuretics, small-dose acetylsalicylic acid (ASA), comorbidities, such as hypertension, type 2 diabetes mellitus (T2DM), obesity, chronic renal failure, coronary heart disease, chronic heart failure, and prior myocardial infarction.\nRESULTS: The disease duration in both groups averaged 8 years. In Groups 1 and 2, first metatarsophalangeal joint arthritis was diagnosed at its onset in 77 and 61%, respectively. In these groups, chronic arthritis was also diagnosed in 19 (37%) and 19 (39%). Examinations revealed tophi in 21 and 37% of cases in Groups 1 and 2, respectively. The administration of diuretics was recorded in 25 (49%) and 17 (35%) patients in these groups.

Hypertension was identified in 23 (45%) examinees in Group 1 and 17 (40%) ones in Group 2. Both groups were matched for the number of patients with obesity (41 and 43%) and for that of patients with T2DM (15 and 10%, respectively). There were significant differences between the compared groups in the incidence of coronary heart disease, myocardial infarction, and chronic heart disease.\nCONCLUSION: The patients' age of gout onset does not affect substantial differences in the clinical features of gout with its comparable duration in the young and elderly patients. The main clinical features of gout are unique to both young and elderly patients. Cardiovascular diseases are more common at gout onset in the elderly.",

        "Abstract":"OBJECTIVE: Secondary prevention in patients with critical limb ischemia (CLI) is crucial for the reduction of cardiovascular morbidity and mortality. Nonetheless, current recommendations are extrapolated from other high-risk populations because of the lack of CLI-dedicated trials. The aim of this explorative study was to evaluate the association of statin therapy with the outcomes of CLI patients.\nMETHODS: The First-Line Treatments in Patients With Critical Limb Ischemia (CRITISCH) registry is a prospective multicenter registry analyzing the effectiveness of all available treatment strategies in 1200 CLI patients. For the purposes of this analysis, patients were divided into two groups based on statin administration. Treatment crossovers and nonadherent patients were excluded from analysis. The primary composite end point of this study was the amputation-free survival (AFS). Major adverse cardiovascular and cerebral events (MACCEs), time to death, and time to major amputation were also analyzed.\nRESULTS: Statin therapy was applied in 445 individuals (37%), 371 (31%) patients received no statins, and 384 subjects were excluded from analysis (treatment crossovers). Patients receiving statins were more likely to be younger (P < .001) and to have a history of coronary heart disease (P < .001) or previous intervention at index limb (P < .001). Patients receiving statin therapy had a lower hazard regarding AFS (hazard ratio [HR], 0.45; 95% confidence interval [CI], 0.34-0.63; P < .001) and death (HR, 0.40; 95% CI, 0.24-0.66; P < .001) as well as lower odds of MACCE (odds ratio, 0.41; 95% CI, 0.23-0.69; P = .001). However, statin therapy was not associated with reduced amputation rates (HR, 1.02; 95% CI, 0.67-1.56; P = .922). Statin effect on AFS was consistent among diabetics (HR, 0.47; 95% CI, 0.31-0.70; P < .001), patients with chronic kidney disease (HR, 0.53; 95% CI, 0.32-0.87; P = .012), and patients older than 75 years (HR, 0.40; 95% CI, 0.26-0.60; P < .001). Statin administration was also associated with an improved AFS in patients with antiplatelet medication (HR, 0.64; 95% CI, 0.41-0.99; P = .049) and without antiplatelet medication (HR, 0.26; 95% CI, 0.12-0.57; P = .001) and after both endovascular therapy (HR, 0.51; 95% CI, 0.34-0.76; P = .001) and bypass revascularization (HR, 0.38; 95% CI, 0.21-0.68; P = .001).\nCONCLUSIONS: Statin therapy in CLI patients is associated with an increased AFS and lower rates of mortality and MACCEs without improving, however, the salvage rates of the affected limb.",

There was good correlation between salicylate doses and serum concentrations (r = 0.69, P less than 0.01); however, large variability existed. With doses less than 80 mg\/kg\/day there was not a single therapeutic salicylate serum concentration (greater than 20 mg\/dl). In children receiving 100 to 110 mg\/kg\/day 55% of the serum concentrations were subtherapeutic. The same pattern persisted with doses greater than 120 mg\/kg\/day; however, 28% of levels were in the toxic range (greater than 30 mg\/dl). There was no evidence of salicylate poisoning in the group; three children receiving greater than 100 mg\/kg\/day had aspirin-induced gastritis. An additional four children, studied prospectively, received ASA 80 to 180 mg\/kg\/day. The fraction absorbed was 14% to 60%, which may be compared to a normal 85% to 90% absorption. Salicylate renal clearance in these children (7.3 to 21 ml\/kg\/hr) was lower than in hyperthermic children. Their steady-state serum salicylate concentrations were subtherapeutic (7 to 11.5 mg\/dl). The high ASA dose needed to overcome the impaired absorption should be accompanied by frequent monitoring of levels because of the unpredictable changes in absorption.",

        "Abstract":"Eighty primary renal allograft recipients, 61 living-related and 19 deceased donor, transplanted from 1963 through 1984 had continuous graft function for 30-47 years. They were treated with three different early immunosuppression programs (1963-1970: thymectomy, splenectomy, high oral prednisone; 1971-1979: divided-dose intravenous methylprednisolone; and 1980-1984: antilymphocyte globulin) each with maintenance prednisone and azathioprine, and no calcineurin inhibitor. Long-term treatment often included the anti-platelet medication, dipyridamole. Although both recipient and donor ages were young (27.2 ± 9.5 and 33.1 ± 12.0 years, respectively), six recipients with a parent donor had >40-year success. At 35 years, death-censored graft survival was 85.3% and death with a functioning graft 84.2%; overall graft survival was 69.5% (Kaplan-Meier estimate). Biopsy-documented early acute cellular and highly probable antibody-mediated rejections were reversed with divided-dose intravenous methylprednisolone. Complications are detailed in an integrated timeline. Hypogammaglobulinemia identified after 20 years doubled the infection rate. An association between a monoclonal gammopathy of undetermined significance and non-plasma-cell malignancies was identified. Twenty-seven azathioprine-treated patients tested after 37 years had extremely low levels of T1\/T2 B lymphocytes representing a \"low immunosuppression state of allograft acceptance (LISAA)\". The lifetime achievements of these patients following a single renal allograft and low-dose maintenance immunosuppression are remarkable. Their success evolved as a clinical mosaic.",

        "Abstract":"BACKGROUND: It is unclear whether the suggested link between COVID-19 during pregnancy and preeclampsia is an independent association or if these are caused by common risk factors.\nOBJECTIVE: This study aimed to quantify any independent association between COVID-19 during pregnancy and preeclampsia and to determine the effect of these variables on maternal and neonatal morbidity and mortality.\nSTUDY DESIGN: This was a large, longitudinal, prospective, unmatched diagnosed and not-diagnosed observational study assessing the effect of COVID-19 during pregnancy on mothers and neonates. Two consecutive not-diagnosed women were concomitantly enrolled immediately after each diagnosed woman was identified, at any stage during pregnancy or delivery, and at the same level of care to minimize bias. Women and neonates were followed until hospital discharge using the standardized INTERGROWTH-21 protocols and electronic data management system. A total of 43 institutions in 18 countries contributed to the study sample. The independent association between the 2 entities was quantified with the risk factors known to be associated with preeclampsia analyzed in each group. The outcomes were compared among women with COVID-19 alone, preeclampsia alone, both conditions, and those without either of the 2 conditions.\nRESULTS: We enrolled 2184 pregnant women; of these, 725 (33.2%) were enrolled in the COVID-19 diagnosed and 1459 (66.8%) in the COVID-19 not-diagnosed groups. Of these women, 123 had preeclampsia of which 59 of 725 (8.1%) were in the COVID-19 diagnosed group and 64 of 1459 (4.4%) were in the not-diagnosed group (risk ratio, 1.86; 95% confidence interval, 1.32-2.61). After adjustment for sociodemographic factors and conditions associated with both COVID-19 and preeclampsia, the risk ratio for preeclampsia remained significant among all women (risk ratio, 1.77; 95% confidence interval, 1.25-2.52) and nulliparous women specifically (risk ratio, 1.89; 95% confidence interval, 1.17-3.05). There was a trend but no statistical significance among parous women (risk ratio, 1.64; 95% confidence interval, 0.99-2.73). The risk ratio for preterm birth for all women diagnosed with COVID-19 and preeclampsia was 4.05 (95% confidence interval, 2.99-5.49) and 6.26 (95% confidence interval, 4.35-9.00) for nulliparous women. Compared with women with neither condition diagnosed, the composite adverse perinatal outcome showed a stepwise increase in the risk ratio for COVID-19 without preeclampsia, preeclampsia without COVID-19, and COVID-19 with preeclampsia (risk ratio, 2.16; 95% confidence interval, 1.63-2.86; risk ratio, 2.53; 95% confidence interval, 1.44-4.45; and risk ratio, 2.84; 95% confidence interval, 1.67-4.82, respectively). Similar findings were found for the composite adverse maternal outcome with risk ratios of 1.76 (95% confidence interval, 1.32-2.35), 2.07 (95% confidence interval, 1.20-3.57), and 2.77 (95% confidence interval, 1.66-4.63). The association between COVID-19 and gestational hypertension and the direction of the effects on preterm birth and adverse perinatal and maternal outcomes, were similar to preeclampsia, but confined to nulliparous women with lower risk ratios.\nCONCLUSION: COVID-19 during pregnancy is strongly associated with preeclampsia, especially among nulliparous women. This association is independent of any risk factors and preexisting conditions. COVID-19 severity does not seem to be a factor in this association. Both conditions are associated independently of and in an additive fashion with preterm birth, severe perinatal morbidity and mortality, and adverse maternal outcomes. Women with preeclampsia should be considered a particularly vulnerable group with regard to the risks posed by COVID-19.",

        "Abstract":"BACKGROUND: Bleeding is a well-known complication of percutaneous renal biopsy (PRB). Thus, antiplatelet agents are routinely held for most patients undergoing elective PRB to decrease bleeding risk.\nMATERIALS AND METHODS: In this systematic review, we examine the association between antiplatelet use and bleeding during PRB. MEDLINE and EMBASE were searched from inception to December 2016 using terms that included \"renal biopsy\", \"antiplatelet\",\"aspirin\", and \"bleeding\". Guidelines and systematic reviews were identified primarily through large databases, including the National Guideline Clearinghouse and Cochrane Database of Systematic Reviews. Two authors independently screened the results, and appraised and graded the evidence using the Grading of Recommendations Assessment, Development, and Evaluation (GRADE) approach.\nRESULTS: Out of 371 guidelines, 40 systematic reviews, and 709 primary studies originally identified, 4 guidelines, 1 systematic review, and 2 primary studies met inclusion criteria. The guidelines recommend halting aspirin for elective PRB. The systematic review found no difference in major outcomes for PRB in patients for whom aspirin was continued versus halted, but was of low quality. The 2 nonrandomized primary studies in PRB patients managed with and without aspirin found no difference in major bleeds but a higher risk of minor bleeds.\nCONCLUSIONS: There is low-quality evidence on the effect of aspirin on bleeding risk from PRB. It is reasonable to discontinue aspirin 7 - 10 days prior to nonemergent biopsies, in accordance with guidelines. Given the results from the primary studies, it is reasonable to perform randomized controlled trials to obtain high-quality evidence to inform clinical practice..",

We report the prevalence of AKI after pediatric noncardiac surgery, the perioperative factors associated with postoperative AKI, and the association of AKI with postoperative outcomes in children undergoing noncardiac surgery.\nMETHODS: Patients ≤18 years of age who underwent noncardiac surgery with serum creatinine during the 12 months preceding surgery and no history of end-stage renal disease were included in this retrospective observational study at a single tertiary academic hospital. Patients were evaluated during the first 7 days after surgery for development of any stage of AKI, according to Kidney Disease: Improving Global Outcomes (KDIGO) criteria. Patients were classified into stages of KDIGO AKI for the purposes of describing prevalence. For further analyses, patients were grouped into those who developed any stage of AKI postoperatively and those who did not. Additionally, the time point at which each patient was first diagnosed with stage I AKI or greater was also assessed. Pre-, intra-, and postoperative factors were compared between the 2 groups. A multivariable Cox proportional hazards regression model was created to examine the time to first diagnosis of AKI using all nonredundant covariates. Analysis of the association of AKI with postoperative outcomes, mortality and 30-day readmission, was undertaken utilizing propensity score-matched controls and a multivariable Cox proportional hazards regression model.\nRESULTS: A total of 25,203 cases between 2013 and 2018 occurred; 8924 met inclusion criteria. Among this cohort, the observed prevalence of postoperative AKI was 3.2% (288 cases; confidence interval [CI], 2.9-3.6). The multivariable Cox model showed American Society of Anesthesiologists (ASA) status to be associated with the development of postoperative AKI. Several other factors, including intraoperative hypotension, were significantly associated with postoperative AKI in univariable models but found not to be significantly associated after adjustment. The multivariable Cox analyses with propensity-matched controls showed an estimated hazard ratio of 3.28 for mortality (CI, 1.71-6.32, P < .001) and 1.55 for 30-day readmission (CI, 1.08-2.23, P = .018) in children who developed AKI versus those who did not.\nCONCLUSIONS: In children undergoing noncardiac surgery, postoperative AKI occurred in 3.2% of patients. Several factors, including intraoperative hypotension, were significantly associated with postoperative AKI in univariable models. After adjustment, only ASA status was found to be significantly associated with AKI in children after noncardiac surgery. Postoperative AKI was found to be associated with significantly higher rates of mortality and 30-day readmission in multivariable, time-varying models with propensity-matched controls.",

Two reviewers independently extracted data, and evaluated study quality using modified Jadad score for RCTs and Newcastle-Ottawa Scale for observational study. A meta-analysis was conducted in the Stata 15.0 software using the DerSimonian and Laird random-effects model.\nRESULTS: 1768 references were identified from literature searching. Four RCTs and four cohort studies that reported the cardiovascular prevention outcome of aspirin in CKD patients (38,341 participants) were included in this review. The pooled data revealed that aspirin had no significant prevention effect on cardiovascular events among CKD patients (RR = 0.96, 95% CI, 0.59-1.13).

It's usually well tolerated, but various side effects have been described. A 15-year-old female with ulcerative colitis developed polyuria, polydipsia, vomiting, and fatigue. She was receiving mesalazine (500 mg, thrice daily, p.o.) and prednisolone for 4 months. She was detected as acute tubular injury as she had dehydration, acidosis, hypostenuria, hematuria, proteinuria, low levels of potassium, uric acid and bicarbonate. These findings were attributed to interstitial nephritis as a side effect of mesalazine, however as renal biopsy was disapproved by the parents, it was not confirmed. After discontinuation of mesalazine her renal tubular functions improved. Potassium and phosphorus supplements were stopped after 7 months, although she had to continue bicarbonate supplementation. We conclude that regular renal screening is important in patients receiving 5-ASA therapy to prevent rare but serious complications, such as interstitial nephritis sometimes leading to chronic renal failure.",

In the present study, we examined the effects of sevoflurane anaesthesia on plasma inorganic fluoride (F-) level and hepatorenal function in patients with and without AED therapy. Twenty-two patients (12 with AEDs = AED group, and ten without AEDs = control group = C group), ASA I, who were free of hepatorenal disease, received approximately 2-3 h sevoflurane anaesthesia. Plasma F- analysis was performed at the stages of: 1) induction of anaesthesia, 2) conclusion of anaesthesia, 3) 15 h after the conclusion of anaesthesia, using an ion-selective electrode calibrated with a standard solution of sodium fluoride. Pre- and postoperative hepatic (aspartate aminotransferase, alanine aminotransferase, alkaline phosphatase, total bilirubin) and renal (blood urea nitrogen, creatinine) function was tested. There were no significant differences between the two groups in the average age (AED group = 9.4 and control group = 10.1 y.o.), body weight, duration of anesthesia, and MAC hours (2.6 and 2.4). The mean peak F- levels were 15.5 and 13.6 microM, in AED and C groups (not significant), respectively. No patient exhibited F- values greater than 50 microM, the hypothetical nephrotoxic threshold.

        "Published":"2007-05-17",
        "Abstract":"BACKGROUND: Unfractionated heparin (UFH) is the traditional agent utilized during percutaneous peripheral interventions (PPIs) despite its well-known limitations. Bivalirudin, a thrombin-specific anticoagulant, overcomes many of the limitations of UFH and has consistently demonstrated comparable efficacy with significantly fewer bleeding complications. The purpose of this study was to compare procedural success in patients undergoing bare-metal stent implantation for atherosclerotic blockage of the renal, iliac, and femoral arteries and receiving either bivalirudin (0.75 mg\/kg bolus\/1.75 mg\/kg\/hr infusion) or UFH (50-70 U\/kg\/hr bolus) as the primary anticoagulant.\nMETHODS: This study was an open-label, nonrandomized retrospective registry with the primary endpoint of procedural success. Secondary endpoints included incidence of: death, myocardial infarction (MI), urgent revascularization, amputation, and major and minor bleeding.\nRESULTS: One hundred and five consecutive patients were enrolled (bivalirudin = 53; heparin = 52). Baseline demographics were comparable between groups. Patients were pretreated with clopidogrel (approx. 71%) and aspirin (approx. 79%). Procedural success was achieved in 97% and 96% of patients in the bivalirudin- and heparin-treated groups, respectively. Event rates were low and similar between groups.\nCONCLUSION: Bivalirudin maintained an equal rate of procedural success in this cohort without sacrificing patient safety. Results of this study add to the growing body of evidence supporting the safety and efficacy of bivalirudin as a possible substitute for UFH in anticoagulation during peripheral vascular bare-metal stent implantation.",

        "Abstract":"OBJECTIVE: Our purpose was to assess fetal central and regional hemodynamics in normal fetuses using two-dimensional, range-gated pulsed Doppler echocardiography in pregnant women on chronic baby aspirin regimen (87 mg).\nSTUDY DESIGN: Fifteen fetuses exposed to maternal chronic ingestion of baby aspirin were compared with 26 control fetuses. Longitudinal studies of the umbilical artery waveform and blood flow through the fetal right and left ventricles were obtained every 4 weeks during gestation in a group of fetuses exposed to daily maternal intake of 87 mg of aspirin. Pulsed Doppler waveforms were obtained below the tricuspid and mitral valves, at the level of the descending aorta (below the ductus), and at the level of the fetal renal artery as it enters the kidney. All tracings were recorded on a strip chart and analyzed with a digital light-pen and graphic overlay system. Peak systolic velocity and minimal diastolic velocity were obtained for the umbilical and fetal renal artery. Peak flow velocity and velocity time integral of the pulsed Doppler waveforms of the atrioventricular valves were calculated. Acceleration time\/ejection time ratio was obtained for the descending aorta.\nRESULTS: No significant differences were found among the two groups in either central or regional circulation.\nCONCLUSION: Chronic daily maternal ingestion of baby aspirin does not significantly affect the central and regional circulation of the fetus.",

        "Abstract":"AIM: Numerous geriatric patients develop colorectal disease. Elderly patients are often considered high-risk surgical candidates. Enhanced recovery after surgery (E.R.A.S.) has been proven to be beneficial for patients. The aim of the study was to evaluate the results of an ERAS protocol in older patients that underwent colorectal surgery compared to younger patients.\nMETHOD: In the period between January 2010 to December 2015 a total of 589 patients underwent elective colorectal surgical interventions treated within the E.R.A.S pathway: 211 patients younger than 65 years, 175 patients aged from 66 years to 75 years, and 203 patients older than 75 years. End point of interest were postoperative complications, 90-day mortality, length of hospital stay and readmission within 30 days.\nRESULTS: Significant differences between the three groups were observed for comorbidities (p:0.001); in particular older patients had significantly more diabetes, renal, cardiac, and respiratory diseases, ASA (p < 0.001), presence of malignancy (p < 0.001). However there were not differences between the groups in surgical procedures (p = 0.095), operative time (p = 0.823), anastomotic leakage (p = 0.960), hospital stay (p = 0.081), readmission rate (p = 0.904), 90-days mortality (p = 0.183) and morbidity (p = 0.973) in accordance with Clavien-Dindo classification. Multivariate logistic regression analysis showed that advanced age in E.R.A.S. pathway is not a predictive factor of morbidity, readmission within 30 days and 90-day mortality.\nCONCLUSION: There was no significant difference in morbidity, 90-day mortality, length of stay or readmission rate in patients aged over 75 years compared with younger patients. Old age does not represent a contraindication to the implementation of the E.R.A.S protocol in patients that underwent colorectal surgery. WHAT DOES THIS PAPER ADD TO THE EXISTING LITERATURE?: In the literature there are not many studies that address the impact of older age in the treatment of colorectal disease in an ERAS program. The aging of the population raises new questions in the management of the colorectal surgery in the elderly. ERAS pathway has been proven to be beneficial for patients, which results in a reduction of postoperative morbidity. Compared to what is reported in the literature this study confirms that ERAS program in colorectal surgery can be applied in older patients with no significant difference in morbidity, 90-day mortality, length of stay or readmission rate compared with younger.",

        "Abstract":"Despite the fact that in recent decades many advances have been made in classification, outcomes measurements and therapeutic regimens, connective tissue diseases remain a challenge for paediatric rheumatologists. Corticosteroids are still the first choice therapy in juvenile systemic lupus erythematosus (SLE); however, it is time for a new therapeutic approach with immunosuppressant drugs in order to obtain a more prolonged survival and reduced organ system damage. A prevention of relapse of thromboembolic phenomena using low-dose aspirin is strongly suggested in children with anticardiolipin antibodies, particularly in those with SLE. The long-term prognosis in juvenile dermatomyositis is significantly improved due to a more aggressive treatment with corticosteroids and methotrexate. The treatment of Henoch-Schöenlein purpura is still under debate, and no agreement has been reached regarding the role of corticosteroids in the prevention of renal involvement. The management of the acute phase of Kawasaki disease is now well established, although there is controversy regarding the role of corticosteroids. It is still under debate how and whether to treat patients who do not fulfil the diagnostic criteria. Polyarteritis nodosa is a disease at risk of death and requires an aggressive approach with corticosteroids and immunosuppressants, while cutaneous polyarteritis needs a close control of an underlying streptococcus infection and prophylaxis with benzatin-penicillin to prevent relapses.",

        "Abstract":"OBJECTIVE: Our objective was to assess the safety, tolerability, pharmacokinetics, and pharmacodynamics of lotrafiban, an oral glycoprotein IIb\/IIIa inhibitor, in patients with a recent myocardial infarction, unstable angina, transient ischemic attack, or stroke.\nMETHODS: A 12-week, double-blind, multi-center, placebo-controlled, parallel-group, phase II study of lotrafiban (the Anti-platelet Useful Dose Study) was conducted in patients. Lotrafiban or placebo was administered as a twice daily oral dose at four dose levels (5-100 mg) for 12 weeks with daily doses of aspirin (300-325 mg). The pharmacokinetics of lotrafiban were characterized with the use of a population approach and were described by a two-compartment model with first order absorption and first order elimination. The pharmacodynamic data, ex vivo platelet aggregation, were described with the use of a direct effect inhibitory sigmoidal model with a baseline. The relationship between the severity of bleeding episodes and predicted steady-state lotrafiban exposure was characterized by logistic regression.\nRESULTS: Pharmacokinetic analysis showed that increasing age and decreasing creatinine clearance resulted in increased exposure to lotrafiban. The concentration-effect relationship was steep, with near complete inhibition of platelet aggregation at lotrafiban concentrations in excess of 20 ng\/mL. Logistic regression showed that at exposures that exceeded approximately 835 ng. h\/mL, the severity of adverse bleeding events increased considerably; this suggested that dosing recommendations should be generated to minimize the likelihood of patients having an area under the plasma concentration-time curve from 0 to 24 hours in excess of this value.\nCONCLUSIONS: Patients whose age exceeded 65 years or whose creatinine clearance was less than 60 mL\/min should be given a lower dose of lotrafiban than younger patients with good renal function.",

We include evidence that suggests the disease has two distinct pathogenetic mechanisms. First, a shock-like terminal phase is associated with the development of widespread pulmonary microvascular thrombosis. These thrombi, composed largely of platelets and leukocytes, produce severe cor pulmonale that cannot be prevented with heparin sodium treatment. Meningococcal endotoxin also produces disseminated intravascular coagulation, which includes the rapid consumption of fibrinogen and the formation of fibrin thrombi in adrenal and renal glomerular capillaries, causing hemorrhagic infarction of the adrenal glands and renal cortical necrosis. This secondary phase of the disease can be modified with heparin therapy, but its control does not improve survival because the parenchymal lesions produced are not immediately life threatening.",

        "Abstract":"PURPOSE: Primary resection is typically performed for children with localised suspected Wilms tumours. Resource limitation may necessitate performing these operations nights and weekends. We hypothesise that outcomes will be worse in patients having nephrectomies out-of-hours (OOH) compared to those in-hours (IH).\nMETHODS: With IRB ethics approval, primary renal tumour resections performed on oncology patients from 1989-2011 were reviewed retrospectively. IH operations were defined as Monday-Friday 0745-1530 hours. Outcomes included major intraoperative complications, capsule rupture, and blood loss. Data were analysed using Fischer Exact and Mann-Whitney U tests.\nRESULTS: There were 64 patients with renal tumours who underwent primary resection. Forty-five procedures were performed IH, and 19 OOH. Groups were similar in age, ASA status, tumour size and grade. In a comparison of major intraoperative complications, capsule rupture, and mean blood loss, differences were 2 vs. 26% (p = 0.007), 27 vs. 42% (p = 0.12), 178 vs. 244 ml (p = 0.15) for IH and OOH respectively.

        "Abstract":"OBJECTIVES: Shunt thrombosis, a potential complication of aortopulmonary shunting, is associated with high mortality. Commonly used oral antiplatelet drugs such as aspirin demonstrate variable absorption and inconsistent antiplatelet effect in critically ill patients early after surgery. IV glycoprotein IIb\/IIIa inhibitors are antiplatelet agents with rapid and reproducible effect that may be beneficial as a bridge to oral therapy.\nDESIGN: Retrospective review of pediatric patients undergoing treatment with IV tirofiban. Discarded blood samples were used to determine pharmacokinetic parameters.\nSETTING: Pediatric cardiac ICU at a single institution.\nPATIENTS: Fifty-two pediatric patients (< 18 yr) undergoing surgical aortopulmonary shunt procedure who received tirofiban infusion as a bridge to oral aspirin.\nINTERVENTIONS: None.\nMEASUREMENTS AND MAIN RESULTS: Primary outcome measures were shunt thrombosis and bleeding events, whereas secondary outcomes included measurement of platelet inhibition by thromboelastography with platelet mapping and pharmacokinetic analysis (performed in a subset of 15 patients). Shunt thrombosis occurred in two of 52 patients (3.9%) after prophylaxis treatment with tirofiban; both thrombosis events occurred after discontinuation of the drug. One patient (1.9%) experienced bleeding complication during the infusion. A tirofiban bolus of 10 µg\/kg and infusion of 0.15 µg\/kg\/min resulted in significantly increased platelet inhibition via adenosine diphosphate pathway (median 66% [43-96] pre-tirofiban compared with 97% [92-99%] at 2 hr; p < 0.05). Half-life of tirofiban in plasma was 142 ± 1.5 minutes, and the average steady-state concentration was 112 ± 62 ng\/mL. Age and serum creatinine were significant covariates associated with systemic clearance. Dosing simulations were generated based upon one compartment model.\nCONCLUSIONS: IV glycoprotein IIb\/IIIa inhibitor as a bridge to oral antiplatelet therapy is safe in pediatric patients after aortopulmonary shunting. Dosing considerations should include both age and renal function. Randomized trials are warranted to establish efficacy compared with current anticoagulation practices.",

        "Abstract":"The laryngeal mask airway (LMA) provides a patent airway when placed 'blindly' into the hypopharynx. At the laryngeal side it is supposed to form a seal surrounding the laryngeal inlet with the epiglottis lying outside the mask aperture. This study is designed to assess the prelaryngeal position of the mask by the fibreoptic technique. METHODS. After approval by the local ethical committee and informed consent, 100 adult patients (ASA groups I and II) undergoing general anaesthesia for extracorporal stroke wave lithotripsy (ESWL, Lithotripter HM 3, Dornier) of the kidney were studied. Anaesthesia was induced with propofol (1.5-2.5 mg.kg-1) and fentanyl (1-1.5 micrograms.kg-1) and maintained with isoflurane and N2O (65% in O2) as clinically indicated. The LMA was left in situ until the patients opened their mouth on command. Monitoring consisted of an ECG (SMV 104-D, Dornier), a pulse oximeter (Nellcor 200, Draeger), and a non-invasive blood pressure monitor (BP 103 N, Hoyer). Clinical assessment of airway patency and fibreoptic laryngoscopy (BF Typ 10, Olympus)--immediately and 20 min following the insertion of the LMA--were performed by two observers. RESULTS. The insertion of the LMA was successful on the first attempt in 89 patients while 5% required two, 4% three and 2% four attempts. 'Blindly' inserted without neuromuscular blockade the LMA provided a clinically sufficient airway in all patients. A central position of the LMA was assessed in only 59% of the cases. In 4 patients the mask was riding on the vocal folds. Positioned at the posterior larynx the cuff produced a compression of the laryngeal orifice when insufflated. Oblique insertion of the LMA or oblique head position during insertion produced a misplacement of the LMA. In 5 cases the LMA followed lateral movements of the head without losing its central position. In 87% the epiglottis was within the lumen of the LMA. Secretions inside the mask lumen or at the anatomic structures were seen in 36%. During manual ventilation with high inspiratory pressure (> 25 cm H2O) the oesophagus opened in 10 cases. CONCLUSIONS. Previous studies have suggested that the LMA takes a 'perfect' position at the laryngeal side when a clinically patent airway is recognized. In contrast, our results demonstrated that a central position of the LMA is achieved in only 59% of the cases. Our results indicate that epiglottic downfolding or left\/right side or anterior\/posterior misplacement are common but generally provide a satisfactory patent airway. This is consistent with fibreoptic findings in children and radiological observations in adults. The LMA is an essential enrichment to conventional airway management. It provides a better seal than the face mask, especially in bearded or in old patients where the facial contours are often not suited to the mask. Ideal indications seem to be elective operations of intermediate duration (1-2 h). The LMA does not protect against aspiration. For patients who are at risk of regurgitation of gastric contents, use of the LMA is absolutely contraindicated. Relative contraindications are local pathology of the pharynx and situations with low pulmonary compliance and\/or high airway resistance (massive obesity, asthma, etc.), especially during controlled ventilation. Further studies are necessary to establish definite indications for the application of the LMA.",

The platelet half-life became longer and renal function stabilized in the treated group, as compared with the placebo group, suggesting a relation between platelet consumption and the glomerulopathy. The glomerular filtration rate, determined by iothalamate clearance, was better maintained in the treated group (average decrease, 1.3 ml per minute per 1.73 m2 of body-surface area per 12 months) than in the placebo group (average decrease, 19.6). Fewer patients in the treated group than in the placebo group had progression to end-stage renal disease (3 of 21 after 62 months as compared with 9 of 19 after 33 months).

        "Abstract":"BACKGROUND: Only few data are available on pregnancy in patients with lupus nephritis (LN) diagnosed before conception. The aim of this study was to identify the risk factors for complicated pregnancy in women with pre-existing LN.\nMETHODS: In a multicentre study, we collected data on 113 pregnancies occurring in 81 women with pre-existing biopsy-proven LN. Primary outcomes were fetal loss including perinatal death and renal flares during and 12 months after pregnancy. Univariate and logistic regression analyses were used to identify predictors of outcomes.\nRESULTS: Renal biopsy performed 7.2 +\/- 4.9 years before pregnancy showed the following WHO classes: 6 patients in II, 8 in III, 48 in IV and 19 in V. At conception, most patients were in complete (49%) or partial (27%) remission. There were nine spontaneous abortions, one stillbirth and five neonatal deaths. Thirty-one deliveries were preterm. Birth weight was <2500 g in 34 newborns. During pregnancy or after delivery, there were 34 renal flares, most of which (20) were reversible. Three patients had a progressive decline of glomerular filtration rate (one on dialysis). At logistic regression analysis, the pregnancy outcome was predicted by hypocomplementaemia at conception (RR 19.02; 90% CI 4.58-78.96) and aspirin during pregnancy (RR 0.11; 90% CI 0.03-0.38). Renal flare was predicted by renal status (partial remission RR 3.0; 90% CI 1.23-7.34, nonremission RR 9.0; 90% CI 3.59-22.57).\nCONCLUSIONS: Pregnancy can be successful in most women with pre-existing LN, even for those with a severe renal involvement at onset. Renal flares during and after pregnancy are not uncommon and can be predicted by renal status assessed before pregnancy. Normocomplementaemia and low-dose aspirin therapy during pregnancy are independent predictors of a favourable fetal outcome.",

        "Abstract":"OBJECTIVES: To investigate the prevalence, predictors and associations between guideline-directed medical therapy (GDMT) and clinical outcomes in acute myocardial infarction (AMI) patients undergoing percutaneous coronary intervention (PCI) from eight academic centers in the United States.\nBACKGROUND: Evidence for GDMT in patients with AMI comes from randomized controlled trials. The use of GDMT in clinical practice is unknown in this setting.\nMETHODS: PROMETHEUS is a multicenter observational registry comprising 19,914 patients with acute coronary syndrome (ACS) undergoing PCI. Patients with AMI were divided into two groups based on the prescription of GDMT or not (non-GDMT) at discharge. GDMT was defined according to American College of Cardiology\/American Heart Association (ACC\/AHA) class I recommendations, specifically, dual antiplatelet therapy, statin and beta-blocker for all AMI patients, and additional ACEI\/ARB in patients with left ventricular ejection fraction (LVEF) less than 40%, hypertension, diabetes mellitus (DM) or chronic kidney disease (CKD). The primary endpoint was major adverse cardiovascular events (MACE) defined as a composite of all-cause death, MI, stroke or unplanned target vessel revascularization (TVR) at 1 year.\nRESULTS: Out of 4,834 patients with AMI, 3,356 (69.4%) patients were discharged on GDMT. Patients receiving GDMT were more often younger and male. Compared with non-GDMT patients, GDMT patients had a significantly lower frequency of comorbidities. Predictors of greater GDMT prescription at discharge were ST-segment elevation myocardial infarction (STEMI), and increased body mass index (BMI), whereas hypertension, prior PCI, anemia and CKD were associated with less GDMT prescription. At 1 year, the use of GDMT was associated with a significantly lower incidence of MACE (13.7% vs. 22.5%; adjusted HR 0.68; 95%CI 0.58-0.80; P < 0.001), death (3.7% vs. 9.4%; adjusted HR 0.61; 95%CI 0.46-0.80; P < 0.001), and unplanned TVR (8.4% vs. 11.3%; adjusted HR 0.76; 95%CI 0.61-0.96; P = 0.020). However, there were no significant differences in the incidence of MI (4.3% vs. 7.0%; adjusted HR 0.75; 95%CI 0.56-1.01; P = 0.056), stroke (1.5% vs. 2.0%; adjusted HR 0.79; 95%CI 0.47-1.34; P = 0.384) between the two groups.\nCONCLUSION: In a contemporary practice setting in the United States, GDMT was utilized in just over two-thirds of AMI patients undergoing PCI. Predictors of GDMT prescription at discharge included STEMI, BMI and absence of hypertension, CKD, anemia or prior PCI. Use of GDMT was associated with significantly lower risk of 1-year MACE and mortality.",

        "Abstract":"The Diabetes Control and Complications Trial (DCCT), a multicenter, randomized, controlled clinical trial, demonstrated that intensive diabetes therapy delays the onset and slows the progression of retinopathy, nephropathy, and neuropathy in patients with insulin-dependent diabetes mellitus. This study presents the effect of intensive therapy on atherosclerosis-related events and associated risk factors. Patients (n = 1,441) between the ages of 13 and 39 years with insulin-dependent diabetes mellitus were randomly assigned to conventional or intensive diabetes treatment. The patients were free of cardiovascular disease at baseline. Patients with hypertension, hypercholesterolemia, or obesity were excluded. Average length of follow-up was 6.5 years (range 3.5 to 9). The study used standardized definitions of macrovascular events, verification of such events, and central laboratories for determination of lipids and the grading of electrocardiograms. The number of combined major macrovascular events was almost twice as high in the conventionally treated group (40 events) as in the intensive-treatment group (23 events), although the differences were not statistically significant (p = 0.08). There were no differences in the cumulative incidence of hypertension. Mean total serum cholesterol, calculated low-density lipoprotein cholesterol, and triglycerides were significantly reduced in the intensive-treatment group (p < or = 0.01), as was the development of low-density lipoprotein cholesterol levels > 160 mg\/dl. Weight gain was significantly increased in the intensive-treatment group (p < 0.001). There were no differences in cigarette smoking habits, consumption of alcohol, or aspirin use between treatment groups. The reduction in some, but not all, cardiovascular risk factors suggests a potential beneficial effect of intensive therapy on macrovascular disease in insulin-dependent diabetes mellitus.",

        "Abstract":"The use of NSAIDs has become routine for adults and children in the management of pain. NSAIDs (other than aspirin [acetylsalicylic acid]) are also enjoying greater popularity as antipyretics since the recognition of Reye's syndrome's putative association with aspirin. In neonates, NSAIDs have been used for many years in an attempt to pharmacologically close the ductus arteriosus. This review examines the various NSAIDs and their potential and real applications in the neonatal population. For completeness, acetaminophen (paracetamol), which has weak NSAID activity and is a widely used analgesic and antipyretic in this patient group, was also included. The prostaglandin system is important for healthy development, and conversely there are unique risks posed by pharmacologic interference with this system in the neonatal period. The prostanoid system in neonates has the capacity to modulate nociception, but comes at the expense of interfering with nearly every organ system. Physiologic effects of inhibition of prostaglandin synthesis applicable to neonates include disruption of the sleep cycle, increased risk of pulmonary hypertension, alterations in cerebral blood flow, decreased renal function, disrupted thermoregulation, and alterations in hemostasis balance, among others. Prostaglandins are also important for the normal development of the central nervous, cardiovascular, and renal systems, and there is evidence that the proper genesis of these systems may be adversely effected by NSAID exposure in utero and in the neonatal period. Gastrointestinal adverse effects have provided the impetus for the development and marketing of selective cyclo-oxygenase type 2 (COX-2) inhibitors. These agents' reputation for safety in adults may not be applicable to neonates. COX-2 is involved in the development of several organ systems, and its inhibition may induce a prothrombotic state. The advent of parenteral formulations of cyclo-oxygenase inhibitors, including COX-2-selective agents, increases the therapeutic flexibility of NSAIDs. However, objective data on the safety of these agents have not kept pace with their clinical availability.",

The primary focus of the review is risk factors for preeclampsia and potential methods suggested for prevention of preeclampsia. In addition, pitfalls in diagnosis of preeclampsia will be emphasized.\nRESULTS: The reported rate of preeclampsia ranged from 9% to 66%. This rate increased with increased severity of diabetes by White's classification, with the highest rate reported in women with pregravid diabetic nephropathy. Risk factors identified for preeclampsia were nulliparity, chronic hypertension, microalbuminuria prior to pregnancy, nephropathy, and poor glycemic control early in pregnancy. There is lack of agreement among reports in the literature concerning criteria used to diagnose preeclampsia. There are two randomized trials that included women with Type 1 diabetes who were randomized to receive either low-dose aspirin or placebo. There was no reduction in the rate of preeclampsia with low-dose aspirin in either trial.\nCONCLUSIONS: In women with pregravid Type 1 diabetes, the rates of preeclampsia and adverse neonatal outcome increase with increased severity of diabetes. Low-dose aspirin does not reduce rate of preeclampsia in such women. Further studies should address the role of good glycemic control prior to 20 weeks gestation and prevention of microalbuminuria.",

The clinical data of 17 TA patients with pregnancy and finally terminated admitted to the First Affiliated Hospital of Zhengzhou University from January 2012 to December 2020 were collected and the maternal and infant outcomes were retrospectively analyzed.  Among the 24 pregnancies in 17 TA patients in our hispital, 11 patients in our hospital were primiparous (46%, 11\/24) and 13 patients were multiparous (54%, 13\/24); 4 cases of chronic hypertension before pregnancy (17%, 4\/24), and 20 cases of non-hypertension (83%, 20\/24) were abserved. Apart from the thoracoabdominal artery type, 15 cases (63%, 15\/24) of brachiocephalic type, 8 cases (33%, 8\/24) of extensive type, and 1 case of pulmonary artery type (4%, 1\/24) were included in TA classification; the renal artery was damaged in 7 cases (7\/8) of the extensive type. Among the 24 pregnancies of 17 TA patients, 8 cases of pregnancy complications occurred, including 4 cases (17%, 4\/24) of preeclampsia, one case of (4%, 1\/24) new-onset hypertension during pregnancy, exacerbation of existing hypertension, thrombocytopenia and ischemic stroke respectively; 3 cases of induced abortion, 1 case of induced labor, and 20 cases of final delivery were found. Of the 20 final deliveries, 3 cases (15%, 3\/20) were delivered through the vagina; 17 cases (85%, 17\/20) were delivered by cesarean section; 3 cases (15%, 3\/20) of fetal growth restriction and 6 cases of oligohydramnios (30%, 6\/20) were occurred. The median gestational age of pregnancy termination of 17 full-term neonates (85%, 17\/20) and 3 premature neonates (15%, 3\/20) was 38.4 weeks (range:29.6-40.9 weeks). All premature women were complicated with pre-eclampsia or severe pre-eclampsia, which lead to premature birth; the birth weight of the neonates was (2 791±783) g. Neonatal asphyxia occurred in 3 cases (15%, 3\/20), and 6 cases (30%, 6\/20) were admitted to the neonatal intensive care unit. None of the newborns died. The patients were followed up for 3 months to 7 years. Except for one case who underwent surgical treatment 3 years after delivery and died of intraoperative hemorrhage, the other 16 patients were in stable condition; all the newborns grew and developed well. The incidences of maternal and infant adverse events were higher in those with chronic hypertension, renal artery involvement, and no use of hormones and aspirin during pregnancy, but the differences were not statistically significant (all >0.05).  Pregnancy with TA has adverse effects on maternal and infant outcomes. To reduce the occurrence of maternal and child adverse events, the condition of TA patients should be fully assessed before pregnancy, multidisciplinary cooperation, regular treatment, strengthened monitoring of the condition, timely treatment of complications, selection of appropriate delivery methods after pregnancy, and vigilance of postpartum complications should be properly carried out.",

In particular, the mortality rate for intracerebral hemorrhage (ICH) patients with hemodialysis (HD) due to advanced stage CRF is high, and the annual number of such cases is increasing. Therefore, we retrospectively investigated 5 years of clinical data from patients with ICH in our institution to reveal differences in the clinical courses of HD and non-HD patients and to identify risk factors for poor outcomes in ICH patients with HD.\nMETHODS: Three hundred sixty-six consecutive patients with nontraumatic spontaneous ICH, 91% of whom did not receive HD (non-HD group) and 9% of whom received HD for the treatment of CRF (HD group), were enrolled. Clinical data, including the presence of intraventricular hemorrhage (IVH), microbleeds, modified Rankin scale scores, previous medical disease history, the presence of HD, and the days on which ICH occurred, were evaluated.\nRESULTS: In a comparison of HD patients and non-HD patients, the HD patients had higher rates of hematomas in the basal ganglia, IVH, use of antihypertensive drugs, antidiabetic drugs, and antiplatelet\/anticoagulants. The mortality rate was higher in the HD group (44%) than in the non-HD group (21%). In the HD group, the risk factors associated with mortality were hematoma volume, the presence of IVH, and lack of antihypertensive drug use. Eighty-five percent of the ICH occurred on intermittent HD days or before the HD procedure on an HD day.\nCONCLUSIONS: Mortality in ICH patients with HD was associated with lack of antihypertensive drug use. Therefore, strict control of blood pressure is needed in HD patients to prevent ICH, especially on intermittent HD days or before the HD procedure.",

Over 6-year follow up, we compared rates of myocardial infarction (MI), all-cause mortality, revascularization, and major bleeding between black and white patients. A multivariable Cox regression model was fit to adjust for potentially confounding variables. Dual-antiplatelet therapy use over time was determined by patient follow-up surveys and compared by race.\nRESULTS: Black patients were younger; were more often female; had higher body mass indexes; had more diabetes mellitus, hypertension, and renal disease; and had lower median household incomes than white patients (P < .001). At 6 years after DES placement, black relative to white patients had higher unadjusted rates of MI (12.1% vs 10.1%, hazard ratio 1.25, 95% CI 1.00-1.57, P = .05) and major bleeding (17.8% vs 14.3%, hazard ratio 1.28, 95% CI 1.07-1.54, P = .01), but there were no significant differences in other outcomes. After multivariable adjustment, there were no statistically significant racial differences in any of these outcomes at 6 years. Similarly, dual-antiplatelet therapy use was comparable between racial groups.\nCONCLUSIONS: Unadjusted rates of MI and major bleeding over long-term follow up were higher among black patients compared to white patients, but these differences may be explained by racial differences in comorbid disease.",

        "Abstract":"Childhood nephrotic syndrome is a rare condition with an incidence of 1-2 per 100000 children aged below 16 years. Untreated idiopathic nephrotic syndrome (INS) is associated with increased risks of life-threatening infection, thromboembolism, lipid abnormalities, and malnutrition. The aim of the management of INS in children is to induce and maintain complete remission with resolution of proteinuria and edema without serious adverse effects of therapy. The majority of children have corticosteroid sensitive idiopathic nephrotic syndrome (CSINS), and in these children, corticosteroid therapy is the mainstay of therapy to induce remission. Data from a meta-analysis of randomized controlled trials (RCTs) indicate that prolonged courses of corticosteroids (up to 7 months) given in the first episode of CSINS reduce the risk of relapse. Nevertheless, many children relapse, and are at risk of corticosteroid toxicity if frequent courses of corticosteroids are required. Data from RCTs supports the use of alkylating agents (cyclophosphamide, chlorambucil), cyclosporine, and levamisole in these children to achieve prolonged periods of remission. The specific management of corticosteroid-resistant idiopathic nephrotic syndrome (CRINS) is more difficult since few therapies are consistently effective, and data from RCTs are limited. In such children, cyclosporine, alkylating agents, and high dose intravenous methylprednisone may be used. In addition to specific therapies for INS, supportive therapies are commonly used to control edema (loop diuretics, aldosterone antagonists, albumin infusions, angiotensin-converting enzyme inhibitors), reduce the risk of infection (antibacterials, pneumococcal vaccination) and thromboembolism (aspirin [acetylsalicylic acid]), and to control hyperlipidemia (HMG-CoA reductase inhibitors), especially in children with CRINS.",

We compared the efficacy and safety of percutaneous nephrolithotomy (PCNL) performed under regional anesthesia between elderly patients (age >65 years) and patients aged <65 years.\nMATERIALS AND METHODS: Between July 2015 and June 2016, fifty patients aged >65 years with renal stones (size >1.5 cm) were treated with PCNL under regional anesthesia (elderly group). We retrospectively compared the outcomes with those obtained in an equal number of patients aged <65 years (younger group) who underwent PCNL under regional anesthesia. Patients with staghorn stones and pyonephrosis and falling under the American Society of Anesthesiologists (ASA) Grade IV were excluded. Data pertaining to demographic characteristics, body mass index, stone bulk, operative time, tract size, number of tracts required, blood loss, clearance rates, complications, and length of hospital stay were analyzed.\nRESULTS: The mean age at presentation in the elderly and younger groups was 66.8 ± 2.1 years and 38.7 ± 11 years, respectively; 56% of the patients in the elderly age group had ASA Grade II, whereas 58% in the younger age group had ASA Grade I. The mean stone size and the number of tracts were comparable in both the groups, whereas operative time was slightly longer in the elderly group (58.54 ± 18 vs. 51.98 ± 18 min;  < 0.05). Postoperative complications and stone-free rates (94% vs. 92%, respectively) were comparable in the two groups.\nCONCLUSIONS: Age itself should not deter the treatment of elderly patients with renal stones as PCNL under regional anesthesia is safe and effective in elderly patients; outcomes in elderly and younger patients were comparable in this study.",

We present a 71-year-old woman with Escherichia coli urosepsis and sepsis-induced myocardial injury masquerading as non-ST elevated myocardial ischemia. Spontaneous psoas hematoma requiring blood transfusion and intracranial hemorrhage developed after antiplatelet and anticoagulant therapies, even in therapeutic doses. The patient was managed conservatively and recovered well with minor residual hemiparesis. Bleeding complications are a common risk of antithrombotic therapy. It is therefore crucial to weigh the impact of efficacy against safety. Old age, female gender, renal insufficiency and sepsis character increased the risk of bleeding in this patient. A misinterpretation of elevated cardiac troponin I may give rise to a diagnostic dilemma and cause unnecessary morbidity.",
