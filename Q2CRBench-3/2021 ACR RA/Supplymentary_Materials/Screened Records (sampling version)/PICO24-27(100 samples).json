        "Abstract":"OBJECTIVES: To investigate the relationship between changes in patient characteristics over time and the effectiveness and safety of adalimumab in the treatment of rheumatoid arthritis (RA) in clinical practice. METHODS: Patients enrolled in the post-marketing registry study in Japan were divided into 5 subgroups based on the time adalimumab treatment was initiated. Demographic and baseline characteristics and responses to adalimumab were compared among the 5 subgroups to detect any time-course trend. Multiple logistic regression analysis was performed to identify characteristics that were significantly associated with the effectiveness or safety of adalimumab and to estimate response rates and the incidence of adverse drug reactions in individual subgroups. RESULTS: During the study period, patient characteristics changed significantly over time, in particular with regard to prior biologic use and concomitant methotrexate therapy. There was a significant trend toward higher response rates and lower incidence of infections and injection-site reactions in patients initiating adalimumab later in the study. Patient characteristics, such as concomitant methotrexate therapy and early stage RA, were significant predictors of the effectiveness and safety of adalimumab. CONCLUSIONS: Patient characteristics have changed since adalimumab became available for the treatment of RA; several of these characteristics were significant predictors of adalimumab effectiveness and safety.",

        "Published":"2006 Dec",
        "Abstract":"BACKGROUND: Anti-tumour necrosis factor (anti-TNF) therapy has been an important development for the treatment of rheumatoid arthritis (RA) but the impact of its delivery on hospital resources in still emerging. AIMS: We audited the effect of starting anti-TNF on the use of other anti-rheumatic therapies and hospital resources in a routine secondary care setting. METHODS: A retrospective study of resource use before and after anti-TNF was conducted. Hospital records of 54 RA patients were studied and data taken from the time of commencing anti-TNF to 1 October 2004 and an equal time period prior to commencing anti-TNF. Identical data were collected for 54 controls not on anti-TNF. Relevant figures were extrapolated to per annum rates. Results were analysed using two-factor ANOVAs comparing the pre- versus post-anti-TNF period. Cases on intravenous (IV) versus subcutaneous (SC) anti-TNF were also compared in separate ANOVAs. RESULTS: Mean duration of anti-TNF therapy was 17.04 months (range 3.60-42.36). Mean pre- and 3-months post-anti-TNF Disease Activity Scores (DAS28) were 6.93 and 3.88, respectively. Cases were more likely than controls to be on oral prednisolone pre- and post-anti-TNF. Methylprednisolone requirement, number of disease-modifying anti-rheumatic drugs (DMARDs), telephone helpline contacts and duration as an inpatient reduced significantly post-anti-TNF. Day case admissions increased but outpatient appointments decreased only in cases on IV anti-TNF. CONCLUSIONS: In a pragmatic setting, anti-TNF therapy led to reduced need for steroid injections and other DMARDs, as well as reductions in use of several hospital resources. Wider replication of these findings will be important for planning delivery. Copyright: (c) 2006 John Wiley & Sons, Ltd.",

        "Abstract":"To analyse the effectiveness of optimization of biologics in rheumatoid arthritis (RA). It was a single-centre retrospective observational study from January 2009 to September 2012. The effectiveness of the optimization of TNF antagonists, tocilizumab and abatacept in RA was studied. Optimization included predefined dose down-titration and\/or expansion of dose interval in early arthritis with sustained DAS28-ESR <2.6 and established arthritis with a sustained DAS28-ESR <3.2. Primary outcome was time to relapse defined as increase in DAS28-ESR greater than 20 % over baseline. Cox's regression analysis was performed to identify predictors of relapse. Sixty-four patients were included in the study. In the survival analysis, rates of relapse were 9.8 % at 6 months, 31.4 % at 12 months and 44.6 % at 18 months. Rates of patients with an increase in DAS28-ESR > 20 % and >=1 inflamed joint at 6, 9 and 18 months were 1.6, 17.2 and 27.1 %, respectively. In relapsing patients, mean DAS28-ESR at relapse was 3.44 (2.94-4.79) and mean DAS28-ESR following the return to the prior dose of the biologic was 2.52 (1.42-3.21). No predictors of relapse were found in multivariate analysis. Optimization of the treatment with biologics in RA is an efficacious and safe treatment option.",

        "Abstract":"OBJECTIVE: To assess the relative efficacy of methotrexate (MTX), azathioprine (AZA), and their combination in the treatment of rheumatoid arthritis (RA) in a double-blind, prospective, multicenter, controlled trial. METHODS: Two hundred nine patients with active RA were treated with escalating doses of MTX (5-15 mg\/week), AZA (50-150 mg\/day), or combination (5mg MTX\/week plus 50 mg AZA\/day-7.5 mg MTX\/week plus 100 mg AZA\/day), with opportunity to increase the dosage at 6-week intervals. The patients were evaluated for significant clinical and laboratory improvement and assessed for radiologic progression at 48 weeks. RESULTS: One hundred ten patients remained on the initial, randomly assigned therapeutic regimen. The percentage of patients who were responders, defined as those who had 30% or greater improvement in at least 3 of 4 variables, was 38% for the combination treatment, 26% for AZA, and 45% for MTX (P = 0.06). A trend toward decreased radiologic progression was seen in the MTX-treated patients. Termination of treatment due to adverse experience occurred more frequently with combination and AZA treatments than with MTX treatment. Lack of effectiveness, adverse gastrointestinal effects, and liver enzyme elevation were the most frequent causes of treatment discontinuation. CONCLUSION: This study establishes that the combination of MTX and AZA in the dosages utilized is not associated with more toxicity than treatment with single agents; however, enhanced efficacy is also not seen. There is a trend toward decreased radiologic progression in patients treated with MTX.",

        "Published":"2014 Jan",
        "Abstract":"AIM: It is well established that tumor necrosis factor (TNF) inhibitors help control disease activity, limit radiographic progression and preserve function in patients with rheumatoid arthritis. However, not all patients respond adequately to initial anti-TNF treatment and some patients lose response over time. Possible treatment modifications include optimizing concomitant disease-modifying antirheumatic drugs, switching to another anti-TNF biologic or another class of agent, or optimizing the dose of the anti-TNF agent. Here we review data on dose optimization of infliximab, with emphasis on dose changes to address inadequate response, nonresponse and loss of response. METHOD: The authors conducted a literature review to identify studies that evaluated the effect of dose optimization on clinical response in infliximab-treated patients with rheumatoid arthritis. RESULTS: Few well-controlled studies of dose optimization of infliximab have been completed for patients with rheumatoid arthritis, and the evidence supporting efficacy and safety after dose adjustment can be difficult to interpret. Studies of dose optimization in infliximab-treated patients who fail to show initial response, have an inadequate response, or lose response over time are not entirely consistent, but tend to show a pattern of improvement after a dose increase. CONCLUSION: Dose optimization involves a balance of risks and benefits, and future research should seek to clarify which patients are most likely to benefit from dose optimization without undue increase in risk.

        "Published":"2012 Jun",
        "Abstract":"OBJECTIVE: The objective of this post hoc analysis was to test the benefits of treating very early rheumatoid arthritis (VERA; <=4 months) using COMET trial data. Treatment response in VERA and early rheumatoid arthritis (ERA; >4 months to 2 years) with combination etanercept+methotrexate (ETN+MTX) or MTX monotherapy was compared. METHODS: Data assessed at week 52 for baseline disease duration effect included remission (disease activity score (DAS)28 <2.6, SDAI <=3.3, Boolean), low disease activity (LDA; DAS28 <3.2), Boolean components of remission and radiographic non-progression. Subjects who discontinued because of lack of efficacy were included as non-responders. RESULTS: Higher proportions of VERA subjects achieved LDA (79%) and DAS28 remission (70%) than ERA (62%, 48%, respectively, p<0.05) with ETN+MTX. Such high responses with MTX monotherapy were not observed (VERA, LDA=47%, DAS28 remission=35%; ERA, 47% and 32% respectively, p>0.70 for each). Regardless of disease duration, no radiographic progression was seen in 80% of subjects with ETN+MTX. In contrast, a higher proportion of VERA subjects showed no radiographic progression compared with ERA subjects treated with MTX (73.9% vs 50%, p=0.01). CONCLUSIONS: Treatment of VERA with ETN+MTX provides qualitatively improved clinical outcomes not seen with MTX monotherapy, supporting the pivotal role of TNF inhibition in early disease.",

Three disease-modifying agents approved in the last 18 months for early intervention in RA are etanercept, leflunomide, and infliximab. For the relief of the signs and symptoms of RA, the new selective cyclooxygenase-2 (COX-2) inhibitors are joining the available nonsteroidal anti-inflammatory drugs. One COX-2 inhibitor is approved for use in RA, and another is under investigation for that indication. As a class, the COX-2 inhibitors offer efficacy similar to traditional NSAIDs but with less GI and platelet toxicity. [References: 21]",

        "Published":"2018 06",
        "Abstract":"BACKGROUND: Rheumatoid arthritis (RA), the most common autoimmune disease in the UK, is a chronic systemic inflammatory arthritis that affects 0.8% of the UK population. OBJECTIVES: To determine whether or not an alternative class of biologic disease-modifying antirheumatic drugs (bDMARDs) are comparable to rituximab in terms of efficacy and safety outcomes in patients with RA in whom initial tumour necrosis factor inhibitor (TNFi) bDMARD and methotrexate (MTX) therapy failed because of inefficacy. DESIGN: Multicentre, Phase III, open-label, parallel-group, three-arm, non-inferiority randomised controlled trial comparing the clinical and cost-effectiveness of alternative TNFi and abatacept with that of rituximab (and background MTX therapy). Eligible consenting patients were randomised in a 1 : 1 : 1 ratio using minimisation incorporating a random element. Minimisation factors were centre, disease duration, non-response category and seropositive\/seronegative status. SETTING: UK outpatient rheumatology departments. PARTICIPANTS: Patients aged >= 18 years who were diagnosed with RA and were receiving MTX, but had not responded to two or more conventional synthetic disease-modifying antirheumatic drug therapies and had shown an inadequate treatment response to a first TNFi. INTERVENTIONS: Alternative TNFi, abatacept or rituximab (and continued background MTX). MAIN OUTCOME MEASURES: The primary outcome was absolute reduction in the Disease Activity Score of 28 joints (DAS28) at 24 weeks post randomisation. Secondary outcome measures over 48 weeks were additional measures of disease activity, quality of life, cost-effectiveness, radiographic measures, safety and toxicity. LIMITATIONS: Owing to third-party contractual issues, commissioning challenges delaying centre set-up and thus slower than expected recruitment, the funders terminated the trial early. RESULTS: Between July 2012 and December 2014, 149 patients in 35 centres were registered, of whom 122 were randomised to treatment (alternative TNFi, n = 41; abatacept, n = 41; rituximab, n = 40). The numbers, as specified, were analysed in each group [in line with the intention-to-treat (ITT) principle]. Comparing alternative TNFi with rituximab, the difference in mean reduction in DAS28 at 24 weeks post randomisation was 0.3 [95% confidence interval (CI) -0.45 to 1.05] in the ITT patient population and -0.58 (95% CI -1.72 to 0.55) in the per protocol (PP) population. Corresponding results for the abatacept and rituximab comparison were 0.04 (95% CI -0.72 to 0.79) in the ITT population and -0.15 (95% CI -1.27 to 0.98) in the PP population. General improvement in the Health Assessment Questionnaire Disability Index, Rheumatoid Arthritis Quality of Life and the patients' general health was apparent over time, with no notable differences between treatment groups. There was a marked initial improvement in the patients' global assessment of pain and arthritis at 12 weeks across all three treatment groups. Switching to alternative TNFi may be cost-effective compared with rituximab [incremental cost-effectiveness ratio (ICER) 5332.02 per quality-adjusted life-year gained]; however, switching to abatacept compared with switching to alternative TNFi is unlikely to be cost-effective (ICER 253,967.96), but there was substantial uncertainty in the decisions. The value of information analysis indicated that further research would be highly valuable to the NHS. Ten serious adverse events in nine patients were reported; none were suspected unexpected serious adverse reactions. Two patients died and 10 experienced toxicity. FUTURE WORK: The results will add to the randomised evidence base and could be included in future meta-analyses. CONCLUSIONS: How to manage first-line TNFi treatment failures remains unresolved. Had the trial recruited to target, more credible evidence on whether or not either of the interventions were non-inferior to rituximab may have been provided, although this remains speculative.

        "Abstract":"INTRODUCTION: Few studies report the epidemiological profile of RA patients attending clinics for comprehensive care. We describe the clinical, socio-demographic characteristics and comorbidities of a cohort of patients with RA. METHODS: Cross-sectional study in a cohort of patients according to ACR criteria\/EULAR 2010 classification who have entered to the AR clinic since October 2012 until May 2014, referred from primary care. Frequencies for socio-demographic, comorbidity, state of disease activity, functional status, biomarkers and therapeutic modalities variables are described. RESULTS: In total, 1652 patients were included with a mean age of 58 years and a duration of 9 years. Rheumatoid factor was positive in 80% and anti-citrullinated peptide antibody in 63% of patients. In total, 43.6% of patients had comorbidities: Hypertension (20.4%), osteoporosis (17.3%) and Sjogren's syndrome (10.4%). Fifty percent of the patients had moderate and high disease activity level measured by DAS-28 score, and the mean HAQ score was 0.64 (DS 1.12). Seventy three percent of patients were treated with oral disease modified anti rheumatic treatment and 63.6% of them were with methotrexate. 42.4% of the patients were treated with glucocorticoids (mean dose 6.3mg). CONCLUSIONS: The epidemiological behavior of a group of RA patients is reported. The presence of comorbidities is significant affecting the risk of morbidity and mortality in these patients. The definition of the epidemiological profile of this population will allow the design of research questions to resolve outstanding problems in the clinical context of this pathology.

The aim of this study, therefore was to evaluate the incidence of MTX induced hepatotoxicity and its risk factors among rheumatoid arthritis (RA) patients. METHODS This retrospective study described 286 patients with RA who received >= 7.5 mg MTX weekly in an academic rheumatology clinic over a 15 year period. The results of serial liver function tests, concurrent MTX dose, cumulative dose and use of hepatotoxic drugs were collected and statistically analyzed according to a consecutive elevation in aminotransferases which occurred over at least a two week interval. RESULTS During the study period, 286 patients (84.4% female) with mean age of 46.6+\/-12.7 years (18-84 years) were enrolled. Transaminitis occurred among 23.7% of patients (incidence: 6.9 per 100 person-years) during 40.5+\/-34.6 month's exposure to MTX (989.6 person-years). The time difference between onset of therapy and occurrence of transaminitis was 22.1+\/-22.0 months. The only significant factor related to the occurrence of transaminitis was the duration of MTX therapy. The average duration of treatment among patients with transaminitis (59.6+\/-42.3 months) was greater than those with no transaminitis (p<0.001). The cumulative dose of MTX was significantly related to the occurrence of transaminitis (p<0.001). CONCLUSION MTX hepatotoxicity is a common complication of long-term treatment with MTX. It is associated with mild liver enzyme elevation and related to the duration of therapy.",

        "Published":"2018 10 15",
        "Abstract":"BACKGROUND: We previously identified, in newly diagnosed rheumatoid arthritis (RA) patients, networks of co-expressed genes and proteomic biomarkers associated with achieving sustained drug-free remission (sDFR) after treatment with tocilizumab- or methotrexate-based strategies. The aim of this study was to identify, within the same patients, metabolic pathways important for achieving sDFR and to subsequently study the complex interactions between different components of the biological system and how these interactions might affect the therapeutic response in early RA. METHODS: Serum samples were analyzed of 60 patients who participated in the U-Act-Early trial (ClinicalTrials.gov number NCT01034137) and initiated treatment with methotrexate, tocilizumab, or the combination and who were thereafter able to achieve sDFR (n = 37); as controls, patients were selected who never achieved a drug-free status (n = 23). Metabolomic measurements were performed using mass spectrometry on oxidative stress, amine, and oxylipin platforms covering various compounds. Partial least square discriminant analyses (PLSDA) were performed to identify, per strategy arm, relevant metabolites of which the biological pathways were studied. In addition, integrative analyses were performed correlating the previously identified transcripts and proteins with the relevant metabolites. RESULTS: In the tocilizumab plus methotrexate, tocilizumab, and methotrexate strategy, respectively, 19, 13, and 12 relevant metabolites were found, which were subsequently used for pathway analyses. The most significant pathway in the tocilizumab plus methotrexate strategy was \"histidine metabolism\" (p < 0.001); in the tocilizumab strategy it was \"arachidonic acid metabolism\" (p = 0.018); and in the methotrexate strategy it was \"arginine and proline metabolism\" (p = 0.022). These pathways have treatment-specific drug interactions with metabolites affecting either the signaling of interleukin-6, which is inhibited by tocilizumab, or affecting protein synthesis from amino acids, which is inhibited by methotrexate. CONCLUSION: In early RA patients treated-to-target with a tocilizumab- or methotrexate-based strategy, several metabolites were found to be associated with achieving sDFR. In line with our previous observations, by analyzing relevant transcripts and proteins within the same patients, the metabolic profiles were found to be different between the strategy arms. Our metabolic analysis further supports the hypothesis that achieving sDFR is not only dependent on predisposing biomarkers, but also on the specific treatment that has been initiated.

        "Abstract":"OBJECTIVES: To evaluate the risk of septic arthritis (SA) in patients with rheumatoid arthritis (RA) treated with anti-tumour necrosis factor (TNF) therapy. METHODS: Using data from the British Society for Rheumatology Biologics Register, a prospective observational study, the authors compared the risk of SA between 11 881 anti-TNF-treated and 3673 non-biological disease-modifying antirheumatic drug (nbDMARD)-treated patients. RESULTS: 199 patients had at least one episode of SA (anti-TNF: 179, nbDMARD: 20). Incidence rates were: anti-TNF 4.2\/1000 patient years (pyrs) follow-up (95% CI 3.6 to 4.8), nbDMARD 1.8\/1000 pyrs (95% CI 1.1 to 2.7). The adjusted HR for SA in the anti-TNF cohort was 2.3 (95% CI 1.2 to 4.4). The risk did not differ significantly between the three agents: adalimumab, etanercept and infliximab. The risk was highest in the early months of therapy. The patterns of reported organisms differed in the anti-TNF cohort. Prior joint replacement surgery was a risk factor for SA in all patients. The rate of postoperative joint infection (within 90 days of surgery) was 0.7%. This risk was not significantly influenced by anti-TNF therapy. CONCLUSIONS: Anti-TNF therapy use in RA is associated with a doubling in the risk of SA. Physicians and surgeons assessing the RA patient should be aware of this potentially life-threatening complication.",

        "Published":"2011 Feb 16",
        "Abstract":"BACKGROUND: Biologics are used for the treatment of rheumatoid arthritis and many other conditions. While the efficacy of biologics has been established, there is uncertainty regarding the adverse effects of this treatment. Since serious risks such as tuberculosis (TB) reactivation, serious infections, and lymphomas may be common to the biologics but occur in small numbers across the various indications, we planned to combine the results from biologics used in many conditions to obtain the much needed risk estimates. OBJECTIVES: To compare the adverse effects of tumor necrosis factor blocker (etanercept, adalimumab, infliximab, golimumab, certolizumab), interleukin (IL)-1 antagonist (anakinra), IL-6 antagonist (tocilizumab), anti-CD28 (abatacept), and anti-B cell (rituximab) therapy in patients with any disease condition except human immunodeficiency disease (HIV\/AIDS). METHODS: Randomized controlled trials (RCTs), controlled clinical trials (CCTs) and open-label extension (OLE) studies that studied one of the nine biologics for use in any indication (with the exception of HIV\/AIDS) and that reported our pre-specified adverse outcomes were considered for inclusion. We searched The Cochrane Library, MEDLINE, and EMBASE (to January 2010). Identifying search results and data extraction were performed independently and in duplicate. For the network meta-analysis, we performed mixed-effects logistic regression using an arm-based, random-effects model within an empirical Bayes framework. MAIN RESULTS: We included 163 RCTs with 50,010 participants and 46 extension studies with 11,954 participants. The median duration of RCTs was six months and 13 months for OLEs. Data were limited for tuberculosis (TB) reactivation, lymphoma, and congestive heart failure. Adjusted for dose, biologics as a group were associated with a statistically significant higher rate of total adverse events (odds ratio (OR) 1.19, 95% CI 1.09 to 1.30; number needed to treat to harm (NNTH) = 30, 95% CI 21 to 60) and withdrawals due to adverse events (OR 1.32, 95% CI 1.06 to 1.64; NNTH = 37, 95% CI 19 to 190) and an increased risk of TB reactivation (OR 4.68, 95% CI 1.18 to 18.60; NNTH = 681, 95% CI 143 to 14706) compared to control. The rate of serious adverse events, serious infections, lymphoma, and congestive heart failure were not statistically significantly different between biologics and control treatment. Certolizumab pegol was associated with significantly higher risk of serious infections compared to control treatment (OR 3.51, 95% CI 1.59 to 7.79; NNTH = 17, 95% CI 7 to 68). Infliximab was associated with significantly higher risk of withdrawals due to adverse events compared to control (OR 2.04, 95% CI 1.43 to 2.91; NNTH = 12, 95% CI 8 to 28). Indirect comparisons revealed that abatacept and anakinra were associated with a significantly lower risk of serious adverse events compared to most other biologics. Although the overall numbers are relatively small, certolizumab pegol was associated with significantly higher odds of serious infections compared to etanercept, adalimumab, abatacept, anakinra, golimumab, infliximab, and rituximab; abatacept was significantly less likely than infliximab and tocilizumab to be associated with serious infections. Abatacept, adalimumab, etanercept and golimumab were significantly less likely than infliximab to result in withdrawals due to adverse events. AUTHORS' CONCLUSIONS: Overall, in the short term biologics were associated with significantly higher rates of total adverse events, withdrawals due to adverse events and TB reactivation. Some biologics had a statistically higher association with certain adverse outcomes compared to control, but there was no consistency across the outcomes so caution is needed in interpreting these results. There is an urgent need for more research regarding the long-term safety of biologics and the comparative safety of different biologics. National and international registries and other types of large databases are relevant sources for providing complementary evidence regarding the short- and longer-term safety of biologics.",

        "Abstract":"Disseminated histoplasmosis can have a varied presentation when it affects the skin. Presentation mimicking a cutaneous neoplasm is an uncommon manifestation. We present the case of an 86-year-old man presenting with a cutaneous lesion clinically suspicious for malignancy that was ultimately determined to be his first clinical manifestation of disseminated histoplasmosis after biopsy for histopathologic analysis. Microscopically, the lesion was a nodule with an eroded epidermis overlying a dense dermal inflammatory process. The infiltrate was characterized by numerous epithelioid histiocytes admixed with acute and chronic inflammation. On closer inspection, numerous 2-4 mum intracellular spores surrounded by a clear halo were identified. The organisms were highlighted with periodic acid schiff (PAS) stain. We present this case to highlight a unique presentation of disseminated histoplasmosis. Although this presentation is uncommon, it serves as a reminder that histopathologic confirmation of clinical diagnoses is important before undertaking more invasive procedures such as excision.

        "Abstract":"OBJECTIVES: To examine whether or not earlier therapeutic intervention with methotrexate (MTX) prevents the development of rheumatoid arthritis (RA) in patients with recent-onset undifferentiated arthritis (UA) showing high anti-citrullinated peptide antibody (ACPA) titers. METHODS: The patients were divided into two groups, one was treated with MTX (MTX+ group, n = 29), and the other was treated without MTX (MTX- group, n = 19), and other disease-modifying anti-rheumatic drugs were not permitted in the two groups before the primary endpoint was met. The primary endpoint is the occurrence of definite RA, and it was compared in the two groups after 1 year. RESULTS: The percentage of patients who developed definite RA in the MTX+ group (17.2%) was significantly lower than that in the MTX- group (78.9%) (log-rank test, P < 0.001, n = 48); adjusted hazards ratio: 0.028 [95% confidence interval (CI): 0.003-0.250, P = 0.001, n = 39]. Treatment effectiveness was not decreased by major risk factors of RA onset such as smoking habits and human leukocyte antigen-DRB1 shared epitope (SE) (smoking habit, odds ratio [OR]: 0.041 [95% CI: 0.007-0.246] P < 0.001; SE, OR: 0.022 [95% CI: 0.002-0.204] P < 0.001). The safety issues were comparable between the two groups. CONCLUSIONS: This suggests that early therapeutic intervention with MTX could safely prevent the development of RA in patients with recent-onset UA showing high ACPA titers.",

        "Published":"2008 May",
        "Abstract":"UNLABELLED: The widespread use of TNFalpha antagonists in recent years has led to the recognition of paradoxical adverse effects, defined as the onset or exacerbation of disorders that are usually improved by TNFalpha antagonists. Cutaneous psoriasis is an example, of which several cases have been reported. OBJECTIVE: To identify cases of psoriasis onset or exacerbation during TNFalpha antagonist therapy and to look for potential predictive factors. METHODS: We retrospectively reviewed cases of psoriasis onset or exacerbation during TNFalpha antagonist therapy. For each case we recorded the following data: age, sex, underlying disease, nature of the TNFalpha antagonist, effectiveness in improving the underlying disease, history of psoriasis in the patient or family, time to psoriasis development, type of psoriasis (confirmed by an experienced dermatologist), concomitant treatments, whether the TNFalpha antagonist was stopped or continued, and the outcome of the psoriasis. These data were compared to those in the literature. RESULTS: We identified 12 patients, six men and six women, with a mean age of 45.5 years. The TNFalpha antagonist was adalimumab in four patients, etanercept in six patients, and infliximab in two patients. The underlying disease was ankylosing spondylitis in six cases, rheumatoid arthritis in four, and psoriatic arthritis in two. Mean time from treatment initiation to psoriasis was 4.1 months (range, 1-15 months). A previous history of psoriasis in the patient was noted in six cases, including four of the six patients taking etanercept. TNFalpha antagonist therapy was effective on the underlying disease in 11 of the 12 patients. The drug was discontinued in five patients, of whom four experienced resolution of their psoriasis. In the remaining seven patients, the drug was continued and the skin lesions remained unchanged. Most of the patients had psoriasis vulgaris (plaque psoriasis); palmoplantar pustulosis was a feature in five patients. DISCUSSION: Over 40 cases of psoriasis onset or exacerbation during TNFalpha antagonist therapy have been reported in the literature. The prevalence of this adverse effect has been estimated at 1.5-5% of patients taking TNFalpha antagonists. The findings from our case series are consistent with data in the literature. Psoriasis is a class effect that has been reported with all the currently available TNFalpha antagonists. The skin lesions develop within the first few months of therapy. Patients with a wide range of underlying diseases can be affected. Palmoplantar pustulosis is a common feature. A previous history of psoriasis seems more common in patients who experience psoriasis onset or exacerbation during etanercept therapy (four of six patients in our study and 55% in the literature); thus, previous psoriasis may be a risk factor for psoriasis exacerbation during etanercept therapy.",

        "Published":"1996 Feb",
        "Abstract":"OBJECTIVE: To determine whether the raised total alkaline phosphatase (TAP) found in patients with active rheumatoid arthritis (RA) is derived primarily from an increase of the bone or liver isoenzyme, and to evaluate the treatment effect of steroids and disease modifying antirheumatic drugs (DMARD) on bone alkaline phosphatase (BAP) in serial analyses. METHODS: 58 patients with RA were treated with the DMARD gold sodium thiomalate (n = 22), D-penicillamine (n = 18), or sulfasalazine (n = 18) over a 24 week period with regular assessment of disease activity and measurement of BAP using a newly developed specific double monoclonal radioimmunometric assay. RESULTS: In the RA group as a whole, BAP correlated with TAP at all time points (e.g., Week 0 rs = 0.50, p < 0.0001). In contrast, no correlation was found between the intraindividual change of BAP and TAP between Weeks 4 and 24. TAP was correlated with disease activity (assessed by plasma viscosity rs = 0.33, p < 0.02 for the whole RA group and rs = 0.48, p < 0.0002 for intraindividual change from Weeks 4 to 24). Similarly, gamma-glutamyltranspeptidase was correlated with disease activity (rs = 0.56, p < 0.0001, and rs = 0.50, p < 0.0001, respectively). In contrast, BAP was not correlated with disease activity. Low dose steroids and the 3 DMARD studied had no significant effect on the time course of BAP. CONCLUSION: In the majority of patients with active RA, any increase of TAP is not mirrored by an increase of BAP. This supports the hypothesis that inflammatory reactions result in an increase in the plasma concentration of the membrane bound enzymes of the hepatobiliary system, including gamma-glutamyltranspeptidase and the liver isoenzyme of alkaline phosphatase, which is likely to be responsible, at least in part, for the increase of TAP. Since BAP is not correlated with disease activity, BAP measurements are not useful in monitoring response to treatment.",

        "Abstract":"OBJECTIVES: To establish if using intensive treatment to reduce synovitis and attain remission in active rheumatoid arthritis (RA) improves all aspects of health-related quality of life (HRQoL). METHODS: A secondary analysis of two randomised clinical trials (CARDERA and TACIT) was undertaken. CARDERA randomised 467 patients with early active RA to different disease-modifying antirheumatic drug (DMARD) regimens, including high-dose tapering corticosteroids. TACIT randomised 205 established patients with active RA to combination DMARDs (cDMARDs) or tumour necrosis factor-alpha inhibitors (TNFis). Short-Form 36 (SF-36) measured HRQoL across eight domains, generating physical (PCS) and mental (MCS) component summary scores. Linear regression evaluated 6-month intensive treatment impacts. Mean SF-36 scores, stratified by end point disease activity category, were compared with age\/gender-matched population scores. RESULTS: In CARDERA, intensive corticosteroid treatment gave significantly greater improvements in PCS but not MCS scores relative to placebo. In TACIT, all eight SF-36 domains had improvements from baseline exceeding minimal clinically important differences with cDMARDs and TNFis. Significantly greater improvements with TNFi relative to cDMARDs were reported in PCS only (p=0.034), after adjusting for covariates. Remission provided the best SF-36 profiles, but scores in physical functioning, role physical and general health in both trials remained below normative values. Patient global assessment of disease activity had a greater association with HRQoL than other disease activity score (DAS28) components. CONCLUSIONS: Intensive corticosteroid treatment in early RA improves physical but not mental health, relative to placebo. In established RA, cDMARDs and TNFi provide similar improvements in HRQoL. As remission optimises but fails to normalise HRQoL, a focus on treatment strategies targeting HRQoL is required. TRIAL REGISTRATION NUMBERS: CARDERA was registered as ISRCTN 32484878.

        "Abstract":"OBJECTIVE: The American College of Rheumatology (ACR) hybrid (a modified mean percent response to treatment) was officially recommended by the ACR as a revision to 20%, 50%, and 70% response criteria (ACR20\/50\/70) scores, but has not been tested in clinical trials. We performed a post hoc analysis of a phase III study of certolizumab pegol (Rheumatoid Arthritis Prevention of Structural Damage 1 [RAPID 1]) using the ACR hybrid. METHODS: Patients with active rheumatoid arthritis were randomized to certolizumab pegol (200 mg or 400 mg every other week) plus methotrexate or placebo plus methotrexate. ACR hybrid scores were compared with ACR20\/50\/70 outcomes. RESULTS: Differences between active treatment and placebo were significant throughout the study using the ACR20 and ACR hybrid outcomes. In the certolizumab pegol 200 mg group, the median ACR hybrid score at week 52 (last observation carried forward) was 49.99. A total of 258 (65.8%) of 392 and 172 (43.9%) of 392 patients had ACR20 and ACR50 responses, respectively. An additional 55 patients (14.0%) and 59 patients (15.1%) had mean improvements in ACR core measures of >= 20% and >= 50%, respectively, and therefore had positive ACR hybrid scores, despite lacking ACR20 and ACR50 responses, respectively. In the placebo group, median ACR hybrid scores were <10 at most time points; unlike other measures, the ACR hybrid measure indicated worsening scores for many patients. CONCLUSION: ACR hybrid analysis had greater sensitivity than traditional ACR20\/50\/70 criteria, demonstrating improvements in ACR20 nonresponders treated with certolizumab pegol. Negligible benefit was observed with placebo using ACR hybrid analysis. Copyright © 2011 by the American College of Rheumatology.",

        "Published":"2006 Oct 18",
        "Abstract":"BACKGROUND: Ankylosing spondylitis (AS) is a chronic inflammatory disease of unknown cause, characterised by sacroiliitis and spondylitis. Generally, treatment is limited to the alleviation of symptoms using non-steroidal anti-inflammatory drugs (NSAIDs). Recently, disease-modifying antirheumatic drugs (DMARDs) have been used for patients for whom NSAIDs do not work. Methotrexate (MTX), a widely used DMARD, is effective for rheumatoid arthritis (RA), and so might work for AS too. OBJECTIVES: To evaluate the efficacy and toxicity of MTX for treating AS. SEARCH STRATEGY: We conducted searches in any language in: CENTRAL (The Cochrane Library Issue 4, 2005); MEDLINE (1966 to November 20, 2005); EMBASE (1980 to November 20, 2005); CINAHL (1982 to November 20, 2005), and the reference sections of retrieved articles. SELECTION CRITERIA: Randomised and quasi-randomised trials examining the efficacy of MTX versus placebo, other medication, or no medication, for AS. DATA COLLECTION AND ANALYSIS: Two reviewers independently assessed unblinded trial reports for inclusion, assessed methodological quality and entered trial data into RevMan 4.2 using the double-entry facility. Disagreements were resolved by a third reviewer. In the absence of significant heterogeneity, results for continuous data were combined using weighted mean difference or standardised mean difference. Relative risk was used for dichotomous data. MAIN RESULTS: Three trials, involving 116 patients, were included. One 12-month trial compared naproxen plus MTX with naproxen alone. Two 24-week trials compared different doses of MTX with placebo. No statistically significant differences were found for the primary outcome measures of physical function, pain, spinal mobility, peripheral joints\/entheses pain, swelling and tenderness, changes in spine radiographs and patient and physician global assessment. Only the response rate in one trial showed a statistically significant benefit of 36% in the MTX group compared to the placebo group (RR 3.18, 95% CI 1.03 to 9.79). This response rate was a composite index that included assessments of morning stiffness, physical well-being, Bath ankylosing spondylitis disease activity index (BASDAI), Bath ankylosing spondylitis functional index (BASFI), health assessment questionnaire for spondyloarthropathies (HAQ-S), and physician and patient global assessment. However, no single outcome showed a statistically significant difference between the MTX and placebo groups when endpoint results were compared. Therefore, this benefit of MTX is questionable. No serious side effects were reported in these trials. AUTHORS' CONCLUSIONS: There is not enough evidence to support any benefit of MTX in the treatment of AS. High-quality randomised controlled trials of longer durations and with larger sample sizes are needed to clarify the effect(s) of MTX on AS. [References: 24]",

With the aim of developing therapeutic guidelines using the disease activity score 28 (DAS28) as disease indices, we investigated the usefulness of bucillamine (BUC), one of the most widely used DMARDs in Japan. Eighty-one patients with early RA who had not previously been treated with DMARDs were suitable for BUC therapy as first-choice treatment. After 24 months of treatment, at least moderate improvement was seen in 87.5% of patients using the DAS28 erythrocyte sedimentation rate (ESR). After 24 months of BUC therapy, 7 patients (43.8%) met the remission criterion of DAS28 (ESR) <2.6. The 24-month BUC continuation rate was 60.5% (49\/81, monotherapy + combination therapy), of which 59.2% (29\/49) were on BUC monotherapy. From the efficacy and safety viewpoints alike, BUC was useful as first-choice treatment for early RA.",

        "Published":"2018 Jan - Feb",
        "Abstract":"BACKGROUND: Previous studies have indicated that a pre-travel single dose of hepatitis A vaccine is not sufficient as protection against hepatitis A in immunocompromised travelers. We evaluated if an extra dose of hepatitis A vaccine given shortly prior to traveling ensures seroconversion. METHOD: Patients with rheumatoid arthritis (n = 69, median age = 55 years) treated with Tumor Necrosis Factor inhibitor(TNFi) and\/or Methotrexate (MTX) were immunized with two doses of hepatitis A vaccine, either as double dose or four weeks apart, followed by a booster dose at six months. Furthermore, 48 healthy individuals, median age = 60 years were immunized with two doses, six months apart. Anti-hepatitis A antibodies were measured at 0, 1, 2, 6, 7 and 12 months. RESULTS: Two months after the initial vaccination, 88% of the RA patients had protective antibodies, compared to 85% of the healthy individuals. There was no significant difference between the two vaccine schedules. At twelve months, 99% of RA patients and 100% of healthy individuals had seroprotective antibodies. CONCLUSION: An extra priming dos of hepatitis A vaccine prior to traveling offered an acceptable protection in individuals treated with TNFi and\/or MTX. This constitutes an attractive pre-travel solution to this vulnerable group of patients. Copyright © 2017. Published by Elsevier Ltd.",

        "Abstract":"OBJECTIVE: To evaluate the efficacy and safety of initial combination treatment with adalimumab (ADA) and methotrexate (MTX) versus monotherapy with ADA or MTX during an open-label extension of PREMIER. METHODS: Patients with early rheumatoid arthritis (RA) received blinded ADA plus MTX, ADA alone, or MTX alone for 2 years in PREMIER. At Year 2, patients could enroll in an open-label extension and receive ADA monotherapy; MTX could be added at the investigator's discretion. Longterm efficacy results are presented as observed data. RESULTS: In the open-label period, 497 of the original 799 randomized patients had >= 1 dose of ADA (by original randomization: ADA plus MTX, n = 183; ADA, n = 159; MTX, n = 155). In the completers cohort [patients with available Year-5 ACR responses and modified total Sharp scores (mTSS)], the Year-5 mean change from baseline in mTSS for the ADA+MTX arm (n = 124) was 2.9, compared with 8.7 and 9.7 in the ADA (n = 115) and MTX (n = 115) arms. Comprehensive disease remission, defined as the combination of DAS28 remission, normal function (Health Assessment Questionnaire <= 0.5), and radiographic nonprogression (DELTAmTSS <= 0.5), was achieved by more patients in the initial ADA+MTX arm (35%) than in the ADA (13%) or MTX (14%) arms. CONCLUSION: Initial combination treatment with ADA plus MTX, followed by open-label ADA, led to better longterm clinical, functional, and radiographic outcomes than either initial ADA or MTX monotherapy during 5 years of treatment.",

RA patients were supposed to receive leflunomide (100 mg\/day loading dose for 3 days followed by 20 mg\/day orally for the 12 months). Serum concentrations of RANTES (regulated upon activation, normal T cell expressed and secreted), monocyte chemoattractant protein-1 (MCP-1), and interleukin-8 (IL-8) were assessed by enzyme-linked immunosorbent assay before and after 3, 6, 9, and 12 months of treatment with leflunomide. Three months therapy with leflunomide caused reduction in serum RANTES and MCP-1 (in both cases, p < 0.001) levels. Decrease in the concentration of these chemokines persisted until the end of the study period but was less significant. In the case of IL-8, its serum levels significantly diminished after 6 months of therapy with leflunomide (p < 0.01) and remained stable to the end of the study. Changes in serum chemokine levels were accompanied by significant decrease of disease activity score (DAS; p < 0.001). Prior to the first dose of leflunomide, serum concentrations of studied chemokines correlated with marker of RA activity such as the erythrocyte sedimentation rate and IL-8 level with DAS. Furthermore, we demonstrated significant correlations between serum levels of RANTES, MCP-1, and IL-8. During study period, such associations were far less or not significant. Leflunomide, beside a clinical improvement, reduce serum chemokines concentrations in RA patients. Leflunomide seems to be an effective treatment for RA, alternative to current therapies.",

        "Abstract":"AIMS: Anti-tumour necrosis factor-alpha (anti-TNF) agents represented treatment advances in a number of rheumatologic diseases. However, adverse effects of anti-TNF agents have been identified through both clinical trials and post-marketing surveillance, especially an increased risk of serious infections. This study firstly described the infectious profiles of anti-TNF agents in a Thai population. METHODS: We retrospectively reviewed all infectious incidences from 100 consecutive medical records of patients who were treated with either etanercept or infliximab for any rheumatologic and non-rheumatologic conditions. RESULTS: Indications for anti TNF-alpha agents were mainly rheumatoid arthritis (46%) and spondyloarthropathy (SpA) (41%). Seventy-seven patients were treated with etanercept and 23 with infliximab. For those whose initial treatment was etanercept, there were two events of suspected active pulmonary tuberculosis (TB) and suspected hepatitis-B virus (HBV) reactivation. Two out of 23 patients (8.7%) who were firstly treated with infliximab had herpes zoster skin infection. Incidence of overall infection before anti-TNF treatment were significantly higher in patient who started with etanercept (0.065 vs. 0.019 cases per person-years in etanercept and infliximab respectively, P < 0.0001). Incidence of overall infection post-anti-TNF treatment were 0.122 and 0.201 cases per person-years in patients who started with etanercept and infliximab with no significant difference (P > 0.05). The overall infection rates were significantly increased after infliximab treatment (P < 0.0001). CONCLUSION: Even thought there were two new events of TB and HBV reactivation after etanercept treatment, incidence of overall infection seemed to be increased after infliximab treatment. The infectious screening and monitoring with high index of suspicion as well as the pre-emptive treatment are still important whenever either etanercept or infliximab is started.",

OBJECTIVE: To determine the effects of antirheumatic treatment, including prednisolone (combination) therapy on total and high density lipoprotein (HDL) cholesterol levels in RA, taking disease activity into account. METHODS: HDL cholesterol and total cholesterol levels were determined in:(a) established RA (b) two cohorts with early active RA, (c) a previously conducted 56 week trial among patients with early RA comparing the value of intensive combination therapy (that included glucocorticoids) with sulfasalazine alone (COBRA trial). RESULTS: In established RA total cholesterol levels were only slightly raised, irrespective of disease activity. However, HDL cholesterol was significantly higher in patients in remission than in patients with active disease. In contrast, in active early RA at baseline total cholesterol was low normal: between 4.6 and 5.1 mmol\/l in the different populations. The level of HDL cholesterol was highly dependent on the duration of storage. In both COBRA groups total cholesterol increased by a mean of 0.6 mmol\/l. HDL cholesterol increased by more than 50% after treatment, leading to an improvement of the total cholesterol\/HDL ratio (atherogenic index). This increase (and index improvement) was much more rapid in the group receiving combination treatment. A similar pattern was seen in the 2001 cohort with early RA. In all the groups with active disease HDL and total cholesterol levels correlated inversely with disease activity. CONCLUSION: In established, but especially in early RA, disease activity is accompanied by atherogenic lipid levels. This dyslipidaemia can be rapidly reversed by aggressive antirheumatic treatment including glucocorticoids.",

        "Abstract":"CP-690,550, a selective inhibitor of the Janus kinase family, is being developed as an oral disease-modifying antirheumatic drug for the treatment of rheumatoid arthritis (RA). A semi-mechanistic model was developed to characterize the time course of drug-induced absolute neutrophil count (ANC) reduction in a phase 2a study. Data from 264 RA patients receiving 6-week treatment (placebo, 5, 15, 30 mg bid) followed by a 6-week off-treatment period were analyzed. The model included a progenitor cell pool, a maturation chain comprising transit compartments, a circulation pool, and a feedback mechanism. The model was adequately described by system parameters (BASE(h), ktr(h), gamma, and k(circ)), disease effect parameters (DIS), and drug effect parameters (k(off) and k(D)). The disease manifested as an increase in baseline ANC and reduced maturation time due to increased demand from the inflammation site. The drug restored the perturbed system parameters to their normal values via an indirect mechanism. ANC reduction due to a direct myelosuppressive drug effect was not supported. The final model successfully described the dose- and time-dependent changes in ANC and predicted the incidence of neutropenia at different doses reasonably well.",

Methotrexate remains the most commonly used therapy and has been the recommended standard against which new drugs should be evaluated and, to date, there is limited evidence that monotherapy with other treatments is superior to MTX. The introduction of biologic agents, such as TNFalpha-antagonists, represented an advance in the treatment of RA. However, there are still patients with no or inadequate response, patients in whom responsiveness to treatment is lost over time, and patients in whom safety issues may develop. Thus, patients may benefit from treatment with newer biologic agents with a different mechanism of action.

        "Abstract":"OBJECTIVES: Targeted treatment is effective in the short term in achieving low disease activity or even remission in patients with rheumatoid arthritis (RA). The benefits of long-term targeted treatment are discussed based on the BeSt study results. METHODS: The BeSt study has incorporated 7 years of targeted treatment, aiming at low disease activity (DAS =<2.4), and including both treatment intensification when DAS is high and treatment tapering and discontinuation if DAS is persistently low. Functional ability over time, (drug free) remission percentages, treatment adjustments and radiological outcomes over 7 years are discussed. RESULTS: Targeted treatment resulted in stabilisation of functional ability after initial improvement, minimal radiological damage progression after the first year, and tapering of medication. Drug free remission was achieved in 15% of completers in year 7. Patients who lost drug free remission (46% up to year 5) restarted treatment and mostly regained remission without radiological deterioration. Patients treated with initial combination therapy responded earlier and had less damage progression that remained evident up to five years follow up. CONCLUSIONS: Early and maintained targeted treatment has functional and radiological benefits over the first 7 years of the BeSt study and can include drug tapering and (partial, temporary or permanent) discontinuation.",

        "Abstract":"OBJECTIVE: To incorporate a new trial design to examine clinical response, cytokine expression and joint imaging in patients with rheumatoid arthritis (RA) switching from etanercept to infliximab treatment. METHODS: A randomised, open-label, clinical trial of 28 patients with an inadequate response to etanercept was conducted. Eligible patients received background methotrexate and were randomised 1:1 to discontinue etanercept and receive infliximab 3 mg\/kg at weeks 0, 2, 6, 14 and 22, or to continue etanercept 25 mg twice weekly. Data were analysed for clinical response, serum biomarker levels, radiographic progression, MRI and adverse events. RESULTS: At week 16, 62% of infliximab-treated patients achieved American College of Rheumatology 20% criteria for improvement in RA (ACR20) responses compared with 29% of etanercept-treated patients. A 30.8% decrease from baseline in Disease Activity Score 28 was observed in patients receiving infliximab, compared with a 16.0% decrease in patients receiving etanercept. ACR20 and American College of Rheumatology 50% criteria for improvement in RA responses correlated at least minimally with intracellular adhesion molecule-1 and interleukin 8 in patients receiving infliximab. 38% of patients who were switched to infliximab showed reductions in Health Assessment Questionnaire scores (>0.4), compared with 0% of patients receiving etanercept. MRI analyses were inconclusive. Both drugs were well tolerated; 54% of infliximab-treated patients and 50% of etanercept-treated patients reported adverse events. CONCLUSIONS: In this exploratory, open-label trial (with single-blind evaluator), patients were randomised to continue with etanercept or switch to infliximab. The small sample size of this hypothesis-generating study was underpowered to show statistical differences between groups.

        "Abstract":"In the 1990's there were concerns that methotrexate might increase the risk of post operative complications following elective orthopaedic surgery; as a result many Units initiated policies to discontinue methotrexate prior to elective orthopaedic surgery. In 2001 we carried out a controlled study of complications after elective surgery in rheumatoid arthritis (RA) patients who either continued or discontinued methotrexate prior to surgery. In this study we showed that continuation of methotrexate therapy prior to orthopaedic surgery did not increase the risk of infection or surgical complication occurring in patients with RA within one year of surgery. The limitation of this study was that complications later than one year were not studied. Sixty-five patients have been followed up. Thirty-one were fully assessed in clinic and 34 underwent a structured telephone interview. There were no incidences of deep bone infection in any patient group so that there is no evidence that continued methotrexate therapy in the perioperative period increases the risk of late deep infections. We adhere to our original advice that in the absence of renal failure or sepsis, methotrexate therapy should not be stopped before elective orthopaedic surgery in patients with RA whose disease is controlled by the drug before surgery.",

METHODS: Data on the efficacy of PsA therapies from selected literature, including American and international medical journals and recent abstracts from key rheumatology meetings, were reviewed. RESULTS: Most therapeutic agents used to treat PsA are used on the basis of data from patients with rheumatoid arthritis (RA), and have not been adequately assessed in patients with PsA. However, the progressively destructive nature of the disease demands aggressive treatment with agents tested specifically in PsA. Conventional agents used to treat RA, such as methotrexate and sulfasalazine, have adverse effects that often lead to drug discontinuation and may not always be effective in reducing symptoms or radiographic progression in PsA. Newer medications, such as etanercept and infliximab, specifically inhibit the actions of tumor necrosis factor, which plays a major role in joint destruction. The Food and Drug Administration has recently approved etanercept for treatment of PsA. Current data with infliximab are limited to small open-label trials; however, randomized controlled trials are underway. CONCLUSIONS: PsA and RA are distinct diseases, and the efficacy and safety of an agent in RA cannot necessarily be equated with efficacy and safety in PsA. For most conventional agents, data from controlled clinical trials in PsA are scant. Etanercept is currently the only therapeutic agent with sufficient data from placebo-controlled, randomized trials to receive a Food and Drug Administration indication for the treatment of PsA.

METHODS: 205 patients fulfilling the ACR criteria for rheumatoid arthritis (RA), not treated with disease modifying antirheumatoid drugs previously, with an early (< or = 1 year duration), active (Disease Activity Score (DAS) > 3.0), rheumatoid factor and\/or HLA DR 1\/4 positive disease were randomised between sulphasalazine (SASP) 2000 (maximum 3000) mg daily (n = 68), or methotrexate (MTX) 7.5 (maximum 15) mg weekly (n = 69) or the combination (SASP + MTX) of both (n = 68). RESULTS: The mean changes in the DAS during the one year follow up of the study was -1.15, -0.87, -1.26 in the SASP, MTX, and SASP + MTX group respectively (p = 0.019). However, there was no statistically significant difference in terms of either EULAR good responders 34%, 38%, 38% or ACR criteria responders 59%, 59%, 65% in the SASP, MTX, and SASP + MTX group respectively. Radiological progression evaluated by the modified Sharp score was very modest in the three groups: mean changes in erosion score: +2.4, +2.4, +1.9, in narrowing score: +2.3, +2.1, +1.6 and in total damage score: +4.6, +4.5, +3.5, in the SASP, MTX, and SASP + MTX groups respectively. Adverse events occurred more frequently in the SASP + MTX group 91% versus 75% in the SASP and MTX group (p = 0.025). Nausea was the most frequent side effect: 32%, 23%, 49% in the SASP, MTX, and SASP + MTX groups respectively (p = 0.007). CONCLUSION: This study suggests that an early initiation therapy of disease modifying drug seems to be of benefit. However, this study was unable to demonstrate a clinically relevant superiority of the combination therapy although several outcomes were in favour of this observation. The tolerability of the three treatment modalities seems acceptable.",

RESULTS: Anti-Toxoplasma IgG antibodies were detected among 46\/60 RA patients (76.7%) versus 29\/60 controls (48.3%), (p = 0.001). Anti-Toxoplasma IgG titre was higher among RA group [median, (range) = 232.940 (8.949-653.242) IU\/ml] than among controls [median, (range) = 68.820 (2.450-318.945) IU\/ml], (p < 0.001). No difference was detected among RA patients either on traditional or biologic treatment regarding anti-Toxoplasma IgG antibodies. No positive anti-Toxoplasma IgM was detected. A positive correlation was detected between anti-Toxoplasma IgG titre and disease activity markers. CONCLUSION: Higher seroprevalence of anti-Toxoplasma IgG antibodies among RA patients compared to controls reflects an association between latent Toxoplasma infection and RA. Our findings support previous studies and necessitate future large-scale studies to elucidate the exact role of Toxoplasma whether a trigger of autoimmunity in RA or an effect of immunosuppression.",

METHODS: J-RAPID double-blind patients were entered into an open-label extension (OLE) study. Patients withdrawn due to lack of efficacy at 16 weeks and double-blind completers without a week-24 American College of Rheumatology (ACR) 20 response received CZP 200 mg every other week (Q2W) plus methotrexate. Double-blind completers with week-24 ACR20 responses were randomized to CZP 200 mg Q2W plus methotrexate or CZP 400 mg every 4 weeks plus methotrexate. RESULTS: The ACR20\/ACR50\/ACR70 response rates of double-blind completers (n = 204) were 89.7%\/67.2%\/36.3% at OLE entry and 95.6%\/84.8%\/58.3% at 52 weeks, respectively. Other clinical, functional and radiographic outcomes were sustained with long-term CZP plus methotrexate. Long-term treatment with CZP was well-tolerated with no new unexpected adverse events observed. The efficacy and safety of CZP treatment were similar between the two dosing schedules. CONCLUSIONS: Continued CZP administration with methotrexate maintained efficacy over 52 weeks and was well-tolerated for Japanese RA patients. No obvious differences in clinical efficacy and safety were observed between the two dosing schedules, giving flexibility in maintenance administration schedules.",

METHODS: We investigated 163 patients (66 with severe disease) and 67 healthy blood donor controls. Genotyping was performed by polymerase chain reaction-restriction fragment length polymorphism. RESULTS: Patients with severe RA (all active disease despite disease modifying antirheumatic drug combination therapy) disclosed the -238 GG genotype in 100% of cases versus 92.8% of the mild-moderates and 92.5% of controls (OR 11.7, Cl 0.6-216, p = 0.03). The +489 AA genotype was seen less often in patients than in controls (OR 4.2. CI 0.97-18.4, p = 0.045), and the contribution to this trend appeared predominant in the anti-TNF treated subgroup. CONCLUSION: The -238 AG genotype was absent in severe RA; in contrast, patients with mild-moderate RA disclosed the same frequency as controls. Thus -238 GG homozygosity is associated with severe RA. The +489 AA genotype might instead protect against worse outcome in RA.",

        "Published":"2011 Jul",
        "Abstract":"TNF-alpha antagonist therapy is associated with a risk of severe, extrapulmonary, disseminated tuberculosis, which is fatal in 10% of cases. The risk of tuberculosis is increased four-fold in patients on TNF-alpha antagonist therapy. The main risk factors are a history of untreated or inadequately treated primary tuberculosis, recent contact with a tuberculosis patient, and residence in or travel to a high-endemicity region. Infection surveillance agencies throughout the world have issued recommendations to ensure the detection and treatment of latent tuberculosis before TNF-alpha antagonist initiation. These recommendations have returned the incidence of tuberculosis to the level seen before the introduction of TNF-alpha antagonists. Nevertheless, there is still room for improvement. Recommendations about latent tuberculosis screening include the use of tuberculin skin tests. However, these tests are positive in individuals vaccinated with the BCG vaccine, which leads to overuse of tuberculosis chemoprophylaxis and, therefore, to unnecessary patient exposure to hepatotoxic effects. Furthermore, tuberculin skin tests may be falsely negative in immunosuppressed patients, leading to underuse of tuberculosis prophylaxis. These shortcomings of tuberculin skin tests have generated interest in interferon-gamma release assays (IGRAs). In patients with overt tuberculosis, IGRAs are more sensitive and more specific than tuberculin skin tests. However, the accuracy of IGRAs for diagnosing latent tuberculosis remains unknown, because no reference standard is available. In addition, patients taking immunosuppressant agents to treat systemic disease may exhibit anergia, which complicates the interpretation of IGRAs. Until additional data become available, caution requires that IGRAs be used only when a positive or negative result, as assessed on a case-by-case basis, will help to decide whether tuberculosis chemoprophylaxis is in order.

        "Published":"2003 Jan",
        "Abstract":"OBJECTIVE: (1) To explore patient compliance with prescribed drug regimens in the setting of usual care for outpatients with rheumatoid arthritis (RA), gout, and polymyalgia rheumatica (PMR) by utilizing electronic medication event monitors (MEMS(R)) to register openings of the medication package. (2) To examine the influence of disease, frequency of intake of the drug, and class of drug on compliance. (3) To explore the influence of demographic factors, quality of life measures, coping, health status, and functional ability as potential predictors of patient compliance. METHODS: A total of 127 consenting consecutive patients were enrolled: 81 patients with RA, 33 taking nonsteroidal antiinflammatory drugs (13 diclofenac TID and 20 naproxen BID) and 48 taking disease modifying antirheumatic drugs [25 sulfasalazine (SSZ) BID and 23 methotrexate (MTX) once weekly]; 17 patients with PMR starting with prednisolone QD; and 29 patients with gout starting with colchicine (12, QD) or starting with uric acid lowering agents (17, QD). All patients received first prescriptions and were instructed to take the medication as prescribed. Followup was 6 months (gout 12 mo). All patients were aware of the monitoring capability of the package. At baseline a series of questionnaires was completed. We summarized the dosing histories as \"taking compliance\" (percentage of total prescribed doses taken), \"correct dosing\" (percentage of doses taken as prescribed), and \"timing compliance\" (percentage of doses taken within +\/- 25% of prescribed interdose intervals). RESULTS: A total of 26,685 days (> 73 patient-years) were monitored. Compliance expressed as \"taking compliance,\" mean (95% CI), \"correct dosing,\" mean (95% CI), and \"timing compliance,\" mean (95% CI) are: naproxen: 82% (75-90), 68% (57-80), 48% (34-61); diclofenac: 77% (61-93), 67% (47-87), 39% (21-57); MTX: 107% (98-117), 81% (75-87), 83% (76-90); SSZ: 72% (60-84), 55% (44-67), 25% (18-33); prednisolone: 96% (89-102), 88% (83-92), 82% (74-89); colchicine: 65% (48-81), 44% (26-62), 32% (18-46); and uric acid lowering agents: 84% (76-92), 74% (63-85), 65% (52-79). Missed doses occurred more frequently than taking of extra doses: in RA, on 10% of all monitored days there was no evidence of dosing, while on 3% of all monitored days extra doses were taken. In PMR and gout these data are 10% and 4%, and 15% and 7%, respectively. We observed a decline of compliance over time in all study medication groups. Multiple regression analyses showed that the class of medication (symptom modifying or disease controlling), the dosing frequency, the patient's sex, coping pattern (avoidance, passive reaction pattern, and expression of emotions), and the overall health (total Nottingham Health Profile score) together explained 67% of the variance in taking compliance (adjusted R2) (p = 0.002). CONCLUSION: Studying patient compliance with prescribed drug regimens utilizing electronic medication event monitors in RA, gout, and PMR showed that large differences exist in compliance between the various medication groups. Compliance declines over time. A regression model shows that it is possible to relate differences in patient compliance to a number of medication and patient related factors.",

        "Abstract":"OBJECTIVE: To evaluate the performance of an interferon-gamma release assay (IGRA) versus the standard tuberculin skin test (TST) as a screening tool for latent tuberculosis (TB) infection prior to the initiation of anti-tumor necrosis factor therapy in patients with autoimmune inflammatory diseases. METHODS: This integrated analysis involved screening of patients with rheumatoid arthritis, those with psoriatic arthritis, and those with ankylosing spondylitis from phase III trials of golimumab. The IGRA used to screen for latent TB was the QuantiFERON-TB Gold In-Tube test. RESULTS: In this pooled analysis, 2,282 patients underwent both IGRA and TST screening prior to golimumab treatment. Among these patients, 13.8% had at least one test yielding positive findings for latent TB, including 9.4% with positive results by TST, 7.0% with positive results by IGRA, and 2.6% with positive results on both tests. The rate of indeterminate results for TB on IGRA was 1.8%. Agreement between the TST and IGRA results, measured by the kappa coefficient, was 0.22 (95% confidence interval 0.157-0.279; P=0.021). Among the patients with positive IGRA findings, 36.9% had positive TST findings. Among the patients with positive TST findings, 27.4% had positive IGRA findings. Overall, 781 (34.2%) of the 2,282 patients had previously received the bacillus Calmette-Guerin (BCG) vaccine; among this vaccinated group, the rate of positivity for latent TB by TST was 15.2% (119 of 781), compared to a rate of positivity of 9.1% (71 of 781) by IGRA (P=0.0002). Among patients who had not received the BCG vaccine, the rate of positivity by TST was 5.0% (62 of 1,248) and the rate of positivity by IGRA was 5.8% (72 of 1,248) (P=0.3745). When the IGRA was repeated in patients whose results were initially indeterminate, the rate of indeterminate IGRA findings for latent TB was much lower than has been previously reported. CONCLUSION: In the absence of a true gold standard test for latent TB infection, results of this comparison of IGRA and TST in a large cohort of patients with rheumatic diseases suggest that the IGRA provides greater specificity and possibly greater sensitivity than the TST.

        "Abstract":"BACKGROUND AND OBJECTIVE: Experimental models suggest the use of different therapy protocols in rheumatoid arthritis (RA) as modulators on periodontal condition. This study evaluated the effects of conventional drug treatment and anti-TNF therapy in patients with RA on microbiological and periodontal condition, establishing the association of markers of periodontal infection with indexes of rheumatic activity. MATERIALS AND METHODS: One hundred seventy nine individuals with RA were evaluated (62 with anti-TNF-. and 115 with only DMARDs). The periodontal evaluation included plaque and gingival indexes, bleeding on probing (BOP), clinical attachment loss (CAL), pocket depth (PD) and subgingival plaque samples for microbiological analysis. Rheumatologic evaluations included a clinical examination, rheumatoid factor (RF), antibodies against cyclic-citrullinated peptides (ACPAs), and activity markers (DAS28-ERS), high sensitive C-reactive protein (hs-CRP), erythrocyte sedimentation rate (ESR). RESULTS: Anti-TNF-alpha therapy influenced periodontal microbiota with a higher frequency of T. denticola (p=0.01). Methotrexate combined with leflunomide exhibited a higher extension of CAL (p=0.005), and anti-TNF-alpha therapy with methotrexate was associated with a lower extension of CAL (p=0.05). The use of corticosteroids exerted a protective effect on the number of teeth (p=0.027). The type of DMARD affected P. gingivalis, T. forsythia and E. nodatum presence. Elevated ACPAs titers were associated with the presence of red complex periodontal pathogens (p=0.025). Bleeding on probing was associated with elevated CPR levels (p=0.05), and ESR was associated with a greater PD (p=0.044) and presence of red complex (p=0.030). CONCLUSION: Different pharmacological treatments for RA affect the clinical condition and subgingival microbiota.

        "Abstract":"Recent studies have reported elevated expression levels in active rheumatoid arthritis patients of the cluster of differentiation (CD) 147 on CD14(+) peripheral blood monocytes and as a result, CD147 may be a target for the development of a novel rheumatoid arthritis therapy. This report describes the inhibitory effects of infliximab on CD147 and metalloproteinases (MMP)-3 and MMP-9 overexpression in peripheral blood monocytes obtained from patients with active rheumatoid arthritis. Thirty patients with active rheumatoid arthritis that were refractory to methotrexate therapy were randomized at a 4:1 ratio into groups A and B, respectively. Group A received three to four infusions of infliximab (3mg\/kg) and group B participants received four infusions of placebo. Both groups were also treated with a stable background dose of methotrexate. The CD147 expression levels on CD14(+) peripheral blood monocytes of rheumatoid arthritis patients was detected by flow cytometry. The expression of CD147, MMP-3, and, MMP-9 mRNA in peripheral blood mononuclear cells was assayed by real-time quantitative PCR, and the expression of MMP-3 and MMP-9 in serum was measured by a multiplexed microsphere-based flow assay. Results showed that the expression of CD147 and MMP-9 mRNA in group A decreased compared to group B. Expression of CD147 on CD14(+) monocytes was reduced (P<0.05), and serum MMP-3 and -9 levels in group A were decreased by week 18. These data suggested that infliximab could inhibit CD147 expression on CD14(+) monocytes as well as reduce the levels of MMP-3 and MMP-9 in peripheral blood monocytes. Copyright © 2012 Elsevier B.V.

Clinical trials indicate that denosumab, a RANKL-specific recombinant humanized monoclonal antibody, is effective in suppressing bone resorption, resulting in increase in bone mineral density (BMD) in post-menopausal women with low BMD, and has the potential to prevent progression of erosions in RA and of skeletal-related events in metastatic bone disease. The effects on fracture reduction in postmenopausal osteoporosis are awaited from the recently finished FREEDOM study. In clinical trials with denosumab, overall adverse events were similar to placebo or comparators, indicating a favorable safety profile in these diseases, which until now have been available up to 4 years, but data on long-term safety will be needed.

        "Abstract":"OBJECTIVE: To compare the effectiveness of a third tumor necrosis factor-alpha (TNF-alpha)-blocking agent with rituximab after failure of 2 TNF-blocking agents in patients with rheumatoid arthritis (RA) in daily clinical practice. METHODS: Patients receiving a third TNF-blocking agent or rituximab after failure of 2 TNF-blocking agents were selected from a Dutch biologic registry. The primary outcome was the results from the Disease Activity Score of 28 joints (DAS28) over the first 12 months after start of the third biologic using mixed-model analyses. Secondary outcomes included the course of the Health Assessment Questionnaire (HAQ) and the separate components of the DAS28 over the first 12 months and the change from baseline in DAS28 and HAQ at 3 and 6 months. RESULTS: The overall course of the DAS28 over the first 12 months was significantly better for rituximab (p = 0.0044), as also observed for the HAQ, although the latter results were not statistically significant (p = 0.0537). The erythrocyte sedimentation rates, C-reactive protein, and swollen joint counts showed a better course for rituximab (p = 0.0008, p = 0.0287, p = 0.0547, respectively), but not the tender joint counts or visual analog scale for general health. DAS28 decreased significantly in both groups at 3 and 6 months (p <= 0.024), but the change in HAQ was significant for rituximab only at 3 months (p = 0.009). CONCLUSION: During the first 12 months of therapy, a larger improvement in disease activity and a trend toward a larger decrease in functional disability was observed in patients receiving rituximab. Switching to a biologic with another mechanism of action might be more effective after failure of 2 TNF-blocking agents in RA.",

        "Abstract":"Biological agents such as monoclonal antibodies and soluble cytokine receptors have taken on an expanding role in the treatment of chronic immune mediated diseases. Progressive multifocal leukoencephalopathy (PML) is a rare central neurological disease caused by JC virus infection that has been described in the setting of conditions with severe impairment of immune surveillance, such as haematological malignancies, stem cell or solid organ transplantation and AIDS. This serious demyelinating disease has recently been described in patients receiving monoclonal antibodies for chronic inflammatory diseases such as multiple sclerosis, Crohn's disease, rheumatoid arthritis, systemic lupus erythematosus or psoriasis. We review here the disease of PML, the different biological agents used in chronic inflammatory diseases that are associated with an increased risk of PML (natalizumab, rituximab, efalizumab and alemtuzumab), and the potential mechanisms that may explain the development of PML. Based on current knowledge of the biology of the JC virus and on the mechanisms of action of these biological agents, we discuss currently available tools that may be helpful in evaluating the risk of PML in this patient population.",

        "Abstract":"Recently published studies confirm that the long-term use of biologicals targeting tumor necrosis factor-alpha (TNF-alpha) in therapy for rheumatoid arthritis (RA) gives rise to sustained improvement in symptoms and signs of disease provided the anti-TNF agent is efficacious and of low immunogenicity. The current regimens for infliximab 3 or 10 mg\/kg infusion in combination with weekly oral methotrexate, or of etanercept 25 mg subcutaneously twice per week, appear to fulfill these criteria. D2E7, a \"human\" antibody produced by phage display, has also been used for over a year. It has recently emerged that anti-TNF therapy protects joints from structural damage. The 1-year data for infliximab and methotrexate combination therapy suggest that this regimen reduces disability. In early RA, etanercept acts more rapidly than methotrexate to decrease symptoms and retard the progression of erosions. In conclusion, for patients with established and early RA, anti-TNF therapies set a new standard for symptom control and joint protection. [References: 35]",

        "Published":"2014 Feb",
        "Abstract":"OBJECTIVE: To compare effectiveness, drug survival, and safety between infliximab, adalimumab, and etanercept, in a nationwide cohort of rheumatoid arthritis (RA) patients. METHODS: This study is a prospective cohort study of 1208 active RA patients. Effectiveness, drug survival, and serious adverse events during entire follow-up (median 2.9 years) were monitored. RESULTS: EULAR and CDAI responses were comparable between the three agents (EULAR good\/moderate responses at 12 months ranged 76-79%). At 12 months, 15-23% achieved remission. For adalimumab and etanercept, adjusted hazard rate (HR) for EULAR\/ACR remission (reference: infliximab) was 2.7 and 2.1 (95% confidence interval was 1.7-4.1 and 1.3-3.4, respectively); males (HR 1.6; 1.1-2.4), use of glucocorticoids (HR 2.0; 1.3-3.0), and swollen joint count >7 (HR 0.36; 0.24-0.55) were independent predictors. Five-year drug survival was 31%, 43%, and 49% for infliximab, adalimumab, and etanercept, respectively (p = 0.010). Infliximab was associated with significantly more withdrawals due to adverse events. Disease activity, CRP, and use of glucocorticoids predicted efficacy-related drug survival; age, use of methotrexate, and prior DMARDs failures predicted safety-related survival. Risk for serious infections was lower with adalimumab (odds ratio [OR] 0.62; 0.38-1.00) or etanercept (OR 0.39; 0.21-0.72) than infliximab, independent of the effects of age (OR 1.65; 1.37-2.00 per 10 years), tender joint count >10 (OR 1.86; 1.21-2.86), and glucocorticoids >35mg\/week (OR 1.83; 1.12-2.99). CONCLUSIONS: Response rates were comparable among anti-TNF agents. Overall, 5-year drug survival was below 50%, with infliximab demonstrating increased safety-related discontinuations. Remission rates are low in clinical practice. Strategies to increase effectiveness and long-term survival of anti-TNF agents in RA are needed. Copyright © 2014 Elsevier Inc. All rights reserved.",

        "Abstract":"OBJECTIVE: Adipose tissue macrophages (ATMs) are a potent source of inflammatory cytokines, with profound effects on adipose tissue function, yet their potential role in rheumatoid arthritis (RA) pathobiology is largely unstudied. METHODS: Periumbilical subcutaneous adipose tissue was obtained from 36 RA patients and 22 non-RA controls frequency matched on demographics and body mass index. Samples were stained for the macrophage marker CD68, and the average proportions of ATMs, crown-like structures (periadipocyte aggregates of 3 or more ATMs), and fibrosis were compared between groups. RESULTS: The adjusted proportion of ATMs among all nucleated cells was 76% higher in RA than in non-RA samples (37.7 versus 21.3%, respectively; P < 0.001), and the adjusted average number of crown-like structures was more than 1.5-fold higher in the RA group than in controls (0.58 versus 0.23 crown-like structure\/high-power field, respectively; P = 0.001). ATMs were significantly more abundant in early RA and in those with anti-cyclic citrullinated peptide seropositivity. Users of methotrexate, leflunomide, and tumor necrosis factor inhibitors had a significantly lower proportion of ATMs compared with nonusers. Crown-like structures were significantly higher in patients with rheumatoid factor seropositivity and in those with C-reactive protein levels >=10 mg\/liter, and significantly lower among those treated with statins. Linear ATMs were significantly associated with whole-body insulin resistance, but not with serum lipids. CONCLUSIONS: ATMs and crown-like structures were more abundant in RA patients and were associated with systemic inflammation, autoimmunity, and whole-body insulin resistance, suggesting possible contributions to the RA disease process. Lower levels of ATMs and crown-like structures associated with specific RA treatments suggest that adipose tissue inflammation may be ameliorated by immunomodulation.

        "Abstract":"Weekly low dose methotrexate is an established treatment for rheumatoid arthritis, but its use in elderly people has not been adequately examined. The aim of this study was to evaluate its safety in elderly patients with rheumatoid arthritis. A retrospective review of the clinical records of rheumatoid arthritis patients over the age of 65 attending a rheumatology unit was conducted. Eligible patients were followed for at least two years and treated with methotrexate in a dose of 7.5 mg\/week while being maintained on concurrent treatment. Thirty three patients were studied. Their mean age was 78.8 years; 32 were female and one was male. Treatment was discontinued in four patients, two because of raised serum liver enzymes and two because of gastrointestinal irritation. No serious adverse events were reported. After two years, haemoglobin levels increased from a mean (SD) of 12.4 (1.3) g\/dl to 13.0 (1.1) g\/dl (r = 0.226, p < 0.005). The white blood count was significantly reduced from 7.9 (1.8) x 10(9)\/l to 6.8 (1.7) x 10(9)\/l (r = 0.184, p < 0.05). No episodes of neutropenia or agranulocytosis were observed. There was a non-significant decrease in platelet count. The erythrocyte sedimentation rate decreased from 56.8 (30.8) to 35.2 (24.6) mm\/h (r = 0.246, p < 0.01). In conclusion, low methotrexate treatment in elderly patients appears to be safe. Routine determination of serum liver enzymes and renal function may reduce individual risk.",

        "Abstract":"Objectives: The aim of this study was to identify the factors that play a role for patients with RA when considering dose reduction (i.e. gradual tapering until discontinuation) of biological DMARDs (bDMARDs), and to determine their relative importance. Methods: A mixed methods design was used in which we identified influencing factors by performing semi-structured interviews and ranked these factors using a Maximum Difference Scaling questionnaire. Also, we looked at the influence of several patient characteristics on this ranking. Results: For sub study 1 and 2, 22 and 192 patients with RA were included, respectively, in the analyses. Thirty factors were identified from the interviews-characterized into nine themes-and appraised in the questionnaire. Most respondents had a positive attitude towards bDMARD dose reduction. The study showed that patients are concerned that dose reduction will lead to a disease flare that affects their daily life (pain, function). It is important for them to know that it is possible to increase the dose if (further) reduction fails and that the bDMARD will be effective again. Patients value the opinion of their rheumatologist, and being involved in the decision to start tapering is highly ranked as well. The most important factors were consistent between different groups of patients. Conclusion: The results from this study facilitate implementation of bDMARD dose reduction; they inform care providers on what is important for patients and provide a basis for shared decision making.",

        "Abstract":"The continuous discovery of new T cell subpopulations in human autoimmune diseases is making the immunopathological network more complex. Th17 cells are one such newly identified subset of T cells, characterized by the production of signature cytokine IL-17. In last few years, several studies have strongly established the regulatory role of Th17 cells and its signature cytokine IL-17 in autoimmune diseases including psoriasis, psoriatic arthritis, rheumatoid arthritis, inflammatory bowel disease, systemic lupus erythematosus and multiple sclerosis. Psoriasis and PsA are immune mediated hyperproliferative diseases, affecting skin and joint respectively. Before the discovery of Th17 cells, psoriasis and psoriatic diseases were thought to be chiefly Th1 mediated diseases; later on IL-17 knockout animal studies as well as human experimental data indicate the crucial role of Th17 cells and its signature cytokine IL-17 in the pathogenesis of these diseases. In vitro human studies have shown the abundance of Th17 cells in the psoriatic plaques. Subsequently our research group has extended this observation in psoriatic arthritis and found the abundance of CD4+IL-17+ T cells in the synovial fluid and majority of these T cells are of memory phenotype (CD4RO+CD45RA-CD11a+). In addition, we showed the significant presence of functional IL-17 receptor in synovial fibroblast of psoriatic arthritis patients. Considering the strong association of IL-17 and psoriatic disease, IL-17 targeted therapy have shown promises in preclinical and clinical trials. In this review article, we have discussed the pathogenic role of IL-17 in psoriatic disease and summarized the therapeutic efficacy and safety profile of different anti IL-17 therapy as an anti-psoriatic agent.",

        "Abstract":"OBJECTIVE: To evaluate the efficacy and safety of leflunomide in comparison with methotrexate (MTX) on patients with rheumatoid arthritis (RA) in China. METHODS: Five hundred and sixty-six patients with active rheumatoid arthritis were randomly assigned to receive leflunomide at 20 mg once daily or MTX at 15 mg once weekly in a controlled trial. Five hundred and four patients completed the 12-week treatment and some patients continued the treatment for 24 weeks. RESULTS: Both leflunomide and MTX could improve the symptoms, signs, and joint function, but there were no changes in X-ray observations of patients with rheumatoid arthritis. In the leflunomide group, the overall rates of effectiveness at 12 weeks and 24 weeks were 86.94% and 92.31% respectively; the rates of remarkable improvement were 64.95% and 79.81% respectively. In the MTX group, the overall rates of effectiveness at 12 weeks and 24 weeks were 84.04% and 83.15% respectively; the rates of remarkable improvement were 56.81% and 75.28% respectively. According to intent-to-treat analysis, the ACR 20% response rates at 12 weeks and 24 weeks in the leflunomide group were 62.54% and 67.18% respectively, compared with 60.08% and 61.32% respectively in MTX group. No statistical differences were shown in the efficacy between the two groups (P > 0.05). The adverse events in the leflunomide group were gastrointestinal symptoms, skin rash, alopecia, nervous system symptoms, decreased leukocyte count, and elevation of alanine aminotransferase (ALT). Most of these side effects were mild and transient. The incidence of adverse events in the leflunomide group was 16.84%, significantly lower than that in MTX group (28.17%, P = 0.002). CONCLUSIONS: Leflunomide is effective in the treatment of RA with less adverse events than MTX. Its efficacy is similar to MTX, but the incidence of adverse events and the rate of withdrawal due to adverse events were lower in the leflunomide group than in MTX group.",

Part II, focusing on specific safety aspects of treatment with traditional and biologic DMARD in patients with RA, is reported here. METHODS: Key questions were identified a priori based on results of a national needs-assessment survey. A systematic review of all clinical practice guidelines and consensus statements regarding treatment with traditional and biologic DMARD in patients with RA published between January 2000 and June 2010 was performed in Medline, Embase, and CINAHL databases, and was supplemented with a \"grey literature\" search including relevant public health guidelines. Systematic reviews of postmarketing surveillance and RA registry studies were performed to update included guideline literature reviews as appropriate. Guideline quality was independently assessed by 2 reviewers. Guideline characteristics, recommendations, and supporting evidence from observational studies and randomized trials were synthesized into evidence tables. The working group voted on recommendations using a modified Delphi technique. RESULTS: Thirteen recommendations addressing perioperative care, screening for latent tuberculosis infection prior to the initiation of biologic DMARD, optimal vaccination practices, and treatment of RA patients with active or a history of malignancy were developed for rheumatologists, other primary prescribers of RA drug therapies, and RA patients. CONCLUSION: These recommendations were developed based on a synthesis of international RA and public health guidelines, supporting evidence, and expert consensus in the context of the Canadian health system. They are intended to help promote best practices and improve healthcare delivery for persons with RA.",

        "Abstract":"OBJECTIVE: Previous studies reported that anti-CCP antibody positivity predicts good response to rituximab (RTX) in rheumatoid arthritis (RA). A quantitative approach to such possibility could be a good way to detect the subset of patients most likely to respond. We investigated whether serum anti-CCP antibody titres could predict response to RTX in RA patients. METHODS: We retrospectively investigated RA patients who received RTX. The primary criterion was decrease in DAS28>1.2 at 6months (M6). Secondary efficacy criteria included a good response and remission according to EULAR. Predictors of response were investigated by multivariate logistic regression analysis. RESULTS: We included 114 RA patients (81.6% female, median age 53.5 [IQR 45.7-61.2] years, median disease duration 8.5 [4.0-16.0] years). Anti-CCP antibodies were present in 93 patients (81.6%), with median anti-CCP antibody titres 583 [195-1509] U\/mL. In all, 44 patients (38.6%) showed decreased DAS28>1.2 at M6. On univariate analysis, high anti-CCP titres were associated with response rather than non-response to RTX (median 1122 [355-1755] vs. 386 [149-800] U\/mL, P=0.0191) at M6. On multivariate regression analysis, with a cut-off of 1000 U\/mL, anti-CCP antibody titres>=1000 was associated with a decrease in DAS28>1.2 (OR 5.10 [1.97-13.2], P=0.0002); a EULAR good response (4.26 [1.52-11.95], P=0.0059); and a trend for EULAR remission (2.52 [0.78-8.12], P=0.1207). CONCLUSION: High anti-CCP antibody titres predict response to RTX in RA. This factor, easily assessed in clinical practice, can help with personalized medicine and selecting the best candidates for RTX treatment. Copyright © 2014 Societe francaise de rhumatologie.

        "Abstract":"OBJECTIVES: To observe the long-term effects of hydroxychloroquine sulfate on retinal electrical activity by multifocal electroretinography (mfERG) and to evaluate the regional variation of retinal dysfunction in subjects with hydroxychloroquine retinopathy. METHODS: Multifocal ERG with 103-hexagon stimulation was performed on 19 patients (36 eyes) treated with hydroxychloroquine for systemic lupus erythematosus, rheumatoid arthritis, or localized atypical scleroderma. Visual acuity testing, Amsler grid testing, and Ishihara color vision testing were also performed. In 2 of the patients, hydroxychloroquine was discontinued due to concerns about toxicity. Both of these patients had additional mfERG performed after discontinuation of medication. RESULTS: Twelve patients (19 eyes) had a normal response density in one or both eyes, including 6 patients (12 eyes) with a low lifetime dose (< or =438 g) of hydroxychloroquine who had normal response densities in both eyes. Eleven patients (17 eyes) had abnormal response densities in one or both eyes, and 2 of these patients (4 eyes) had significant attenuation of response densities in almost the whole tested field; 4 patients had a normal mfERG result for one eye but had a slight decrease of response densities for the other eye. There were 4 patterns of abnormal mfERG amplitude change observed: (1) paracentral loss, (2) foveal loss, (3) peripheral loss, and (4) generalized loss. Implicit times were abnormal for pericentral responses in 3 patients. The results of color vision and Amsler grid testing were normal, except for one patient with a generalized loss pattern. In 2 subjects in whom hydroxychloroquine toxicity was suspected, response densities improved after termination of hydroxychloroquine. CONCLUSIONS: Long-term hydroxychloroquine use may be associated with mfERG abnormalities. The mfERG appears to detect retinal physiological change earlier than visual acuity testing, color vision testing, or Amsler grid testing can. The greatest value of the mfERG is in differentiating a retinal cause and, hence, providing important evidence for hydroxychloroquine toxicity, for whatever visual field loss is apparent on perimetry.",

Patients with active RA, with Disease Activity Score-28 joints (DAS-28) >3.2, starting oral MTX, were included. We measured at baseline, 3 and 6 mo: DAS-28, Health Assessment Questionnaire-Disability Index (HAQ-DI), patient's perception of disease severity, morning stiffness and pain, as well as modifications in sTREM-1 levels. A reduction in DAS-28 > 1.2 at 3 or 6 mo was considered adequate response. A significant decrease in DAS-28 was observed at 3 and 6 mo. HAQ-DI also decreased at 3 and 6 mo. No significant changes were observed in sTREM-1 levels at 3 or 6 mo. Using as cut-off a baseline value of sTREM-1 levels > 390 pg\/ml, we obtained low values of sensitivity (61.5%), specificity (59.3%), positive predictive value (59.3%) and negative predictive value (61.5%) for adequate response to MTX at 3 mo. We found no clinical value of sTREM-1 levels in predicting therapeutic response to MTX in RA. Further studies should evaluate if sTREM-1 levels are predictive for other outcomes, including higher structural damage or good response to biologics.",

        "Abstract":"OBJECTIVE: To determine the efficacy and safety of pamapimod (a selective inhibitor of the alpha-isoform of p38 MAP kinase) as monotherapy in comparison with methotrexate (MTX) treatment in adult patients with active rheumatoid arthritis (RA). METHODS: Patients were randomly assigned to 1 of 4 treatment groups and received 12 weeks of double-blind treatment. One group received MTX (7.5 mg\/week with planned escalation to 20 mg\/week), and 3 groups received pamapimod (50, 150, or 300 mg) once daily. The primary efficacy end point was the proportion of patients meeting the American College of Rheumatology 20% improvement criteria (achieving an ACR20 response) at 12 weeks. Secondary end points included ACR50 and ACR70 responses, change from baseline in the Disease Activity Score in 28 joints (DAS28), categorical analyses of DAS28\/European League Against Rheumatism response, and change from baseline in each parameter of the ACR core set of measures. Safety monitoring included recording of adverse events (AEs), laboratory testing, immunology assessments, administration of electrocardiograms, and assessment of vital signs. RESULTS: Patients assigned to receive MTX and pamapimod had similar demographics and baseline characteristics. At week 12, fewer patients taking pamapimod had an ACR20 response (23%, 18%, and 31% in the 50-, 150-, and 300-mg groups, respectively) compared with patients taking MTX (45%). Secondary efficacy end points showed a similar pattern. AEs were typically characterized as mild and included infections, skin disorders, and dizziness. Pamapimod was generally well tolerated, but the 300-mg dose appeared to be more toxic than either the 2 lower doses or MTX. CONCLUSION: The present results showed that pamapimod was not as effective as MTX in the treatment of active RA.",

        "Published":"2010",
        "Abstract":"INTRODUCTION: Rheumatoid arthritis (RA) is associated with changes in body composition and bone mineral density (BMD). The purpose of the present study was to evaluate whether anti-TNF treatment in early RA has an impact on body composition and BMD besides that which could be achieved by intensive disease-modifying anti-rheumatic drug (DMARD) combination therapy. METHODS: Forty patients with early RA who failed treatment with methotrexate up to 20 mg\/week for 3 months were randomised to addition of sulphasalazine and hydroxychloroquine (treatment A) or addition of infliximab (treatment B). At 3, 12 and 24 months, body composition and BMD were assessed by total-body dual-energy X-ray absorptiometry. At the same time points, leptin, adiponectin, apolipoproteins, insulin-like growth factor-1 (IGF-1) and markers of bone remodelling were analysed. Compliance to treatment was considered in the analyses. Data were analysed with a mixed, linear model. RESULTS: Patients treated with anti-TNF had a significant increase in fat mass at 2 years, 3.8 (1.6 to 5.9) kg, in contrast to patients in treatment A, 0.4 (-1.5 to 2.2) kg (P = 0.040), despite similar reduction in disease activity. Both treatment strategies prevented loss of muscle mass and bone. Leptin concentrations increased significantly in both groups at 2 years and adiponectin increased significantly at 2 years in treatment A and at 1 year in treatment B. There were no significant changes in apolipoproteins or IGF-1. The markers of bone resorption decreased at 12 months in both treatment groups with no significant difference between the treatment groups. CONCLUSIONS: Infliximab therapy increased body fat mass, an effect that was not achieved with the combination of DMARDs, despite a similar reduction in disease activity, and thus seemed to be drug specific. The increase of fat mass was not associated with an exacerbated atherogenic lipid profile. Leptin and adiponectin concentrations increased in both treatment groups. The increase of adiponectin may partially explain the reduced frequency of cardiovascular diseases found when disease activity is reduced in RA. TRIAL REGISTRATION: ISRCTN39045408.",

        "Abstract":"OBJECTIVE: To assess the clinical outcome of patients with polymyalgia rheumatica (PMR) and giant cell arteritis (GCA). METHODS: All charts of consecutive patients with a diagnosis of PMR and\/or GCA attending a tertiary referral center from June 1989 to February 1996 were reviewed following a predetermined protocol. Subsequently, the majority of patients (90%) were assessed clinically or by telephone interview. Registered variables included demographic data, disease characteristics, prednisone dosage and duration, comorbidities, and clinical outcomes. RESULTS: There were 149 patients (133 with PMR alone, 7 with GCA alone, 9 with both); 94 (63%) were females; the mean age was 68 +\/- 9 years, and the mean disease duration from the first symptom to the rheumatology consultation was 13 +\/- 12 weeks (1-99). Typical clinical features of PMR were present in patients with PMR. Synovitis was observed in 26 patients. The presenting symptoms for GCA were typical features in 13 patients and blindness in 3 (2%) patients. Mean followup was 3.7 +\/- 2 years. Comorbid conditions were present in 71 patients: 12 patients had hypertension, 13 had fractures, 8 diabetes, 29 cataract, 8 major infection, and 37 had other complications. Cancer was diagnosed in 4 patients and 6 patients had died. Prednisone was prescribed in 148 patients (mean dose 23 +\/- 14 mg) for a mean time of 28 +\/- 29 mo. Nonsteroidal antiinflammatory drugs were prescribed in 51 (34%) patients and methotrexate in 2. Disease remission was achieved in 81 (54%) patients (72 remissions, 9 presumed remissions) in whom steroid therapy had been stopped. Another 54 (36%) patients were still taking prednisone at the time of the interview, all were in clinical remission. Seventeen patients developed rheumatoid arthritis subsequent to the diagnosis of PMR. CONCLUSION: PMR and GCA should not necessarily be considered diseases with favorable outcome. In many of our patients, steroids were required for a prolonged period. Some patients developed significant complications attributable to steroid therapy. A significant number of patients progressed to rheumatoid arthritis.",

        "Abstract":"BACKGROUND: To date, Kaposi sarcoma has not been mentioned among the adverse effects of triptolide\/tripdiolide, ethyl acetate extracts or polyglycosides of the Chinese herbal remedy Tripterygium wilfordii Hook F. CASE REPORT: A patient was diagnosed with rheumatoid arthritis at the age of 29 years. She underwent treatment with corticosteroids, methotrexate and gold sodium thiosulfate, and was chronically taking ketoprofen. At the age of 59 years she started to take a powder (=2 g\/day) from a Chinese physician for treatment of rheumatoid arthritis. This powder was supplied to her regularly for 10 years. At the age of 69 years, multiple soft, violaceous to dark-red patches, plaques, nodules and blisters of varying sizes appeared on a background of severely edematous skin on her legs, and later on her arms. Biopsy specimens of the leg lesions were diagnostic for human herpesvirus 8-associated Kaposi sarcoma. Triptolide (235 microg\/1 g) and tripdiolide were found in the Chinese powder by the use of Liquid Chromatography Electrospray Ionization Mass Spectrometry. Administration of the powder was stopped and medication with paclitaxel was introduced. General condition of the patient improved and skin lesions diminished significantly. CONCLUSIONS: This case indicates a possible association between triptolide\/tripdiolide chronic intake and development of human herpesvirus 8-associated Kaposi sarcoma. Triptolide\/tripdiolide could contribute to development of Kaposi sarcoma by reactivation of latent human herpesvirus 8, permitted by immunosuppression induced by triptolide.",

        "Published":"2016 Mar 11",
        "Abstract":"BACKGROUND: Rheumatoid arthritis (RA) is often characterized by the presence of rheumatoid factor, anti-citrullinated protein antibodies, and bone erosions. Current therapies can compromise immunity, leading to risk of infection. The interleukin-20 receptor (IL-20R) axis comprising IL-19, IL-20, and IL-24 and their shared receptors activates tissue homeostasis processes but not the immune system. Consequently, modulation of the IL-20R axis may not lead to immunosuppression, making it an interesting drug target. We evaluated the role of the IL-20R axis in RA and associations between plasma cytokine levels and clinical disease. METHODS: Plasma IL-19, IL-20, and IL-24 levels were measured in early RA patients during a treat-to-target strategy by enzyme-linked immunosorbent assays. The IL-20R1 and IL-22R1 levels in paired peripheral blood mononuclear cells and synovial fluid mononuclear cells from a different cohort of RA patients were evaluated by flow cytometry and confocal microscopy. Monocytes\/macrophages were stimulated with heat-aggregated human immunoglobulin immune complexes and immune complexes containing citrullinated fibrinogen, and osteoclasts were incubated with IL-19, IL-20, and IL-24. RESULTS: The plasma concentrations of IL-20 and IL-24 (but not IL-19) were increased in early RA patients compared with healthy controls (both P < 0.002) and decreased after 6 months of treatment (both P < 0.0001). The expression of IL-22R1 (but not IL-20R1) was increased on monocytes from RA synovial fluid compared with monocytes from both RA and healthy control peripheral blood. The plasma concentrations of IL-20 and IL-24 were increased in rheumatoid factor and anti-citrullinated protein antibody positive compared with negative early RA patients (all P < 0.0001). Immune complexes stimulated the production of the IL-20R cytokines by monocytes\/macrophages. Increased baseline plasma concentrations of IL-20 and IL-24 were associated with Sharp-van der Heijde score progression after 24 months (Spearman's rho = 0.19 and 0.26, both P < 0.05) in the early RA patients. The IL-22R1 was expressed by osteoclast precursors and in multinucleated osteoclasts. IL-20 and IL-24 increased the secretion of monocyte chemoattractant protein 1 by these cells. CONCLUSIONS: This study suggests that IL-20 and IL-24 link RA-associated autoantibodies with radiographic progression via the IL-22R1. Modulation of this axis holds promise as feasible anti-erosive treatment modalities in seropositive RA.",

        "Abstract":"OBJECTIVE: The presence of certain HLA class II antigens is strongly associated with the progression of joint destruction in rheumatoid arthritis (RA). Such antigens may be more effective than other class II antigens in inducing the formation of autoreactive T cells after presentation of (auto)antigens. We investigated whether early and aggressive treatment with disease-modifying antirheumatic drugs could modify this relationship. METHODS: We analyzed data from 2 studies of patients with early RA treated according to different strategies. The first study consisted of 2 cohorts, one (n = 109; median disease duration before treatment 4 months) was treated according to the pyramid strategy (initial nonsteroidal antiinflammatory drugs, followed by chloroquine [CQ] or sulfasalazine [SSZ] when necessary), and the other (n = 97; median disease duration before treatment 2 weeks) was immediately treated with CQ or SSZ. The second study comprised 155 patients (median disease duration 4 months) from the Combinatietherapie Bij Reumatoide Artritis (COBRA) trial, in which patients were randomly assigned to combination treatment with step-down prednisolone, methotrexate (MTX), and SSZ (n = 76) or with SSZ alone (n = 79). Prednisolone and MTX dosages were tapered and stopped after 28 and 40 weeks, respectively. The extent of joint damage was measured by the modified Sharp method. RESULTS: In the pyramid treatment cohort, the median increase in Sharp score after 2 years was 12 in patients positive for the shared epitope (SE) and 1 in SE- patients. In the immediate treatment cohort, the median increase was 3 in SE+ patients and 2 in SE- patients. In the SSZ group of the COBRA study, the median increase in Sharp score after 1 year was 11 in DR4+ patients and 3 in DR4- patients. In the combination treatment group, the median increase was 4 in DR4+ patients and 2 in DR4- patients. Significance was confirmed by multiple regression using log-transformed scores. CONCLUSION: Early and aggressive antirheumatic drug treatment affects the association of HLA class II alleles with progression of joint damage in RA.",

        "Abstract":"Rheumatoid arthritis (RA) is a multisystem autoimmune disease, of unknown aetiology with high morbidity and significantly increased mortality. Over recent years, the introduction of targeted therapies with biologic agents have made major inroads to the outcomes in RA. The first such agents developed were TNF-alpha inhibitors. However, despite their high efficacy, up to 30% patients fail to respond adequately, or develop adverse reaction to TNF-alpha inhibitors. This suggests that other pathological mechanisms are involved, in addition to those mediated by TNF-alpha. Abnormal T-cell function has long been thought to play a key role in the pathogenesis of RA, stimulating both the production of pro-inflammatory cytokines and recruitment of other inflammatory cells, resulting in joint destruction and systemic disease. Abatacept, the first of a group of T-cell co-stimulation modulators, targeting T-cell activation, has recently been licensed for use in RA and shows promise as a useful drug to treat this major disabling disease.

        "Abstract":"Multidrug resistance-1 (MDR-1) is characterized by overfunction of P-glycoprotein (P-gp), a pump molecule that decreases intracellular drug concentration by effluxing them from the intracellular space. Broad ranges of structurally unrelated compounds are transported by P-gp, including antineoplastic agents, HIV protease inhibitors, prednisone, gold salts, methotrexate, colchicine as well as several antibiotics. In contrast, many other compounds such as calcium channel blockers (verapamil) and immunosupressors (cyclosporine-A) are able to inhibit P-gp function. The P-gp role in therapeutic failures has been extensively studied in cancer; however, there is little information regarding MDR-1 phenotype in autoimmune disorders. It has been reported that an increased number of lymphocytes are able to extrude P-gp substrates in rheumatoid arthritis, immune thrombocytopenic purpura and systemic lupus erythematosus, the patients with poor response to treatment being the ones that exhibit the highest values. This may be due, at least in part, to a simultaneous long-term usage of several drugs that induce P-gp function. Since abnormally activated cell compartments characterize autoimmune diseases, it is possible that those cells are the ones that exhibit drug resistance. The study of drug resistance mechanisms in autoimmunity may be helpful for the optimization of the current therapeutic schemes through their combination with low doses of P-gp inhibitors.

METHODS: We conducted a multicenter randomized, double-blind, placebo-controlled trial of leucovorin administration, 2.5-5.0 mg orally, to be given 24 hours after the single, weekly, oral dose of methotrexate. Every 3 weeks for 52 weeks, patients were evaluated for rheumatic disease activity and side effects. Dosage adjustments for both methotrexate and leucovorin were made as needed, according to a defined protocol. The primary outcome evaluated was the frequency of study withdrawals because of side effects and\/or inefficacy. Secondary outcomes evaluated included the frequency of side effects and the relative efficacy of methotrexate in the leucovorin and placebo treatment groups. RESULTS: Ninety-two evaluable patients were analyzed (44 took leucovorin and 48 placebo).

        "Abstract":"OBJECTIVE: To determine whether there is a quantitative relationship between smoking history and response to therapy with tumor necrosis factor (TNF) antagonists. METHODS: A history of cigarette smoking was obtained from a questionnaire completed by each patient starting therapy with TNF antagonists since 2002 (n=154). A core set of demographic and clinical variables was recorded at baseline and at 3 and 12 months. The extent of smoking was quantified in pack-years (py), with 1 py equivalent to 20 cigarettes per day for 1 year. The association between smoking intensity and response was assessed using contingency tables and logistic regression analysis. Response to therapy was defined according to the European League Against Rheumatism improvement criteria. RESULTS: There was an increasing trend of no response at 3 and 12 months with increasing py history [p (trend)=0.008 and 0.003, respectively]. The change in Disease Activity Score (DAS)28 over the first 3 months was inversely associated with the number of py (r=-0.28, p=0.002). The association of py history with response failure was independent of age, sex, disease duration, baseline disease activity score (DAS28), Health Assessment Questionnaire (HAQ) score, IgM rheumatoid factor, and smoking at baseline. The most significant effect was seen in patients treated with infliximab. CONCLUSION: RA patients with a history of smoking were more likely to show a poor response to TNF antagonists. Response failure was associated with the intensity of previous smoking, irrespective of smoking status at initiation of anti-TNF therapy.",

However, the clinical response to MTX and frequency of adverse effects from the drug exhibit marked interpatient variability. Over the past decade, there has been a quest to identify genetic markers that reliably predict MTX efficacy and toxicity and help optimize MTX therapy in RA; that is, the field of MTX pharmacogenetics. This review will summarize key pharmacogenetic studies examining SNPs in the genes encoding enzymes in the MTX cellular pathway and their association with MTX response in RA. As evident from this review, MTX pharmacogenetics in RA remains a muddled field, mostly due to inconsistent results from several small underpowered studies.",

Researchers used validated outcome assessment instruments to measure endpoints of disability, pain, patient global assessment, medication costs, laboratory costs, and number of physician visits. Patients were studied by strict prospective protocol at 6-month intervals for 3 years. Controls included parallel results with other drugs, and before and after values for the individual patient. Beneficial effects were observed with the \"disease-modifying\" drugs: intramuscular gold, penicillamine, and methotrexate. Of these, gold had the most apparent effect. An average of 9 months of gold therapy resulted in highly significant reductions in disability (P less than 0.005), pain (P less than 0.001), and patient global assessment (P less than 0.005). However, patients receiving gold and methotrexate had nearly twice as many visits to physicians. In addition, drug costs increased strikingly with gold, and laboratory costs tripled. Relatively minor differences among nonsteroidal antiinflammatory agents were difficult to interpret. The outcome assessment techniques used in the study are sensitive measures, which confirm the results of experimental studies and extend observations to new outcomes, including cost and disability.",

        "Abstract":"OBJECTIVE: To evaluate the similarities between LBEC0101 (etanercept biosimilar) and the etanercept reference product (ETN-RP) in terms of efficacy and safety, including immunogenicity, in patients with active rheumatoid arthritis despite methotrexate treatment. METHODS: This phase III, multicentre, randomised, double-blind, parallel-group, 54-week study was conducted in Japan and Korea. The primary efficacy endpoint was the change from baseline in the disease activity score in 28 joints based on erythrocyte sedimentation rate (DAS28-ESR) at week 24. American College of Rheumatology 20% (ACR20) response rate, adverse events (AEs), pharmacokinetics and development of antidrug antibodies (ADAs) were also evaluated. RESULTS: In total, 374 patients were randomised to LBEC0101 (n=187) or ETN-RP (n=187). The least squares mean changes from baseline in DAS28-ESR at week 24 in the per-protocol set were -3.01 (95% CI -3.198 to -2.820) in the LBEC0101 group and -2.86 (95% CI -3.051 to -2.667) in the ETN-RP group. The estimated between-group difference was -0.15 and its 95% CI was -0.377 to 0.078, which was within the prespecified equivalence margin of -0.6 to 0.6. ACR20 response rates at week 24 were similar between the groups (LBEC0101 93.3% vs ETN-RP 86.7%). The incidence of AEs up to week 54 was comparable between the groups (LBEC0101 92.0% vs ETN-RP 92.5%), although fewer patients in the LBEC0101 group (1.6%) than the ETN-RP group (9.6%) developed ADAs. CONCLUSION: The clinical efficacy of LBEC0101 was equivalent to that of ETN-RP. LBEC0101 was well tolerated and had a comparable safety profile to ETN-RP. TRIAL REGISTRATION NUMBER: NCT02357069.

The purpose of this study was to investigate whether disease-modifying anti-rheumatic drugs (DMARDs) and steroids are involved in the regulation of GLS expression. Fibroblast-like synoviocytes (FLSs) obtained from patients with rheumatoid arthritis (RA) were cultured and stimulated by interleukin (IL)-1beta with or without DMARDs and steroids. The expression levels of GLS were determined using the reverse transcription-polymerase chain reaction and an ELISA. In cultured rheumatoid FLSs, the expression of GLS mRNA was significantly increased by stimulation with IL-1beta. By contrast, GLS mRNA levels in IL-1beta-stimulated FLSs were reduced by treatment with aurothioglucose (AuTG) and dexamethasone (DEX). These findings indicate that AuTG and DEX have anti-rheumatic activity, which is mediated via the suppression of GLS production. Neither methotrexate (MTX) nor sulfasalazine (SSZ) had a significant influence on GLS levels in our study.",

METHODS: Adult patients in Japan with inadequate response to TCZ-SC q2w were randomized to either TCZ-SC 162 mg qw monotherapy or TCZ-SC 162 mg q2w monotherapy for 12 weeks (double-blind). The primary endpoint was the change from baseline in adjusted Disease Activity Score 28-erythrocyte sedimentation rate (DAS28-ESR) at week 12. Efficacy, safety and pharmacokinetics were assessed. RESULTS: TCZ-SC qw was superior to TCZ-SC q2w for adjusted mean change in DAS28-ESR from baseline to week 12. The difference in the change in DAS28-ESR between TCZ-SC qw and q2w was -1.21 (95%CI: -2.13, -0.30, p = .0108). A higher proportion of patients receiving TCZ-SC qw achieved DAS28-ESR remission\/low disease activity than TCZ-SC q2w. Adverse events were 71.4% and 66.7% for TCZ-SC qw and q2w, respectively; infection was the most common event with one fatal case with TCZ-SC qw. CONCLUSIONS: In patients with inadequate response to TCZ-SC q2w, shortening the dosing interval to qw improved efficacy with acceptable tolerability.

Early and aggressive treatment with good control of disease activity has improved the prognosis of the disease, however, there is significant variability in the response of patients to different therapeutic agents. Hence it is essential to find the predictors of response to a drug at baseline so that we can avoid the delay in achieving remission and improve the outcome. Here we review the literature on available predictors for treatment response in general and specifically for methotrexate and biological agents. We also look at specific scores or indices that can help predict the response in individual patients. [References: 21]",

        "Abstract":"Objectives: To determine possible differences in serious adverse effects among the 10 currently approved biological and targeted synthetic DMARDs (b\/ts-DMARDs) for RA. Methods: Systematic review in bibliographic databases, trial registries and websites of regulatory agencies identified randomized trials of approved b\/ts-DMARDs for RA. Network meta-analyses using mixed-effects Poisson regression models were conducted to calculate rate ratios for serious adverse events (SAEs) and deaths between each of the 10 drugs and control (i.e. no b\/ts-DMARD treatment), based on subjects experiencing an event in relation to person-years. Confidence in the estimates was assessed by applying the Grading of Recommendations Assessment, Development and Evaluation approach (GRADE). Results: A total of 117 trials (47 615 patients) were included. SAEs were more common with certolizumab compared with abatacept (rate ratio = 1.58, 95% CI: 1.18, 2.14), adalimumab (1.36, 95% CI: 1.02, 1.81), etanercept (1.60, 95% CI: 1.18, 2.17), golimumab (1.45, 95% CI: 1.00, 2.08), rituximab (1.63, 95% CI: 1.16, 2.30), tofacitinib (1.44, 95% CI: 1.03, 2.02) and control (1.45, 95% CI: 1.13, 1.87); and tocilizumab compared with abatacept (1.30, 95% CI: 1.03, 1.65), etanercept (1.31, 95% CI: 1.04, 1.67) and rituximab (1.34, 95% CI: 1.01, 1.78). No other comparisons were statistically significant. Accounting for study duration confirmed our findings for up to 6 months' treatment but not for longer-term treatment (6-24 months). No differences in mortality between b\/ts-DMARDs and control were found. Based on the GRADE approach, confidence in the estimates was low due to lack of head-to-head comparison trials and imprecision in indirect estimates. Conclusion: Despite low confidence in the estimates, our analysis found potential differences in rates of SAEs. Our data suggest caution should be taken when deciding among available drugs.

        "Abstract":"Many patients with rheumatoid arthritis have impaired gastric acid secretion and dysfunction of the lacrimal and salivary glands, conditions which have been proposed to be due to glandular atrophy. The hypothesis that the rheumatoid inflammation by itself has a depressive effect on these secretory functions was tested on 20 patients with active rheumatoid arthritis who underwent 16 weeks of sulphasalazine therapy. The patients responded well to the treatment, with reduction of joint indices and acute phase reactants. The resting and stimulated whole salivary secretion rate increased in 9\/10 and 8\/10 patients, respectively. The maximal gastric acid output increased in those patients who had a moderate reduction in acid output prior to treatment. When estimated by s-pepsinogen I, the gastric secretory capacity increased in all patients but one. In a group of auranofin treated patients, s-pepsinogen I rose only in those who responded to treatment with reduced disease activity. These results support the idea that the impaired secretory functions are at least partially reversible and probably also partly inflammatory mediated.",

        "Abstract":"BACKGROUND: Spontaneous cases of hepatic adverse events have been reported in patients with rheumatoid arthritis who were being treated with leflunomide, one of the newer disease-modifying antirheumatic drugs (DMARDs). We assessed the risk of hepatic events associated with the use of leflunomide and other DMARDs. METHODS: Two cohorts comprising 41,885 patients with rheumatoid arthritis who had been dispensed a DMARD between September 1, 1998, and December 31, 2001, were formed using claims databases. Follow-up was from the first dispensing date to the occurrence of a serious or nonserious hepatic event. A nested case-control approach was used to estimate adjusted rate ratios of hepatic events associated with DMARDs dispensed during the prior year, as compared with methotrexate monotherapy. RESULTS: There were 25 cases of serious hepatic events (rate, 4.9 per 10,000 per year) and 411 nonserious hepatic events (rate, 80.0 per 10,000 per year). There was no increase in the rate of serious hepatic events with either leflunomide (rate ratio [RR] = 0.9; 95% confidence interval [CI]: 0.2 to 4.9) or traditional DMARDs (RR = 2.3; 95% CI: 0.8 to 6.5). However, the rate was increased with biologic DMARDs (RR = 5.5; 95% CI: 1.2 to 24.6). The rate of nonserious hepatic events was also increased with biologic DMARDs (RR = 1.5; 95% CI: 1.0 to 2.3), but not with leflunomide (RR = 0.9; 95% CI: 0.7 to 1.3) and traditional DMARDs (RR = 1.1; 95% CI: 0.8 to 1.4). CONCLUSIONS: We found no evidence of an excess risk of serious or nonserious hepatic events with the use of leflunomide as compared with methotrexate. Still, the increased risk observed with the new biologic DMARDs should be investigated further.",

        "Abstract":"INTRODUCTION: For patients with rheumatoid arthritis (RA) whose treatment with a tumour necrosis factor inhibitor (TNFi) is failing, several biological treatment options are available. Often, another TNFi or a biological with another mode of action is prescribed. The objective of this study was to compare the effectiveness and cost-effectiveness of three biologic treatments with different modes of action in patients with RA whose TNFi therapy is failing. METHODS: We conducted a pragmatic, 1-year randomised trial in a multicentre setting. Patients with active RA despite previous TNFi treatment were randomised to receive abatacept, rituximab or a different TNFi. The primary outcome (Disease Activity Score in 28 joints) and the secondary outcomes (Health Assessment Questionnaire Disability Index and 36-item Short Form Health Survey scores) were analysed using linear mixed models. Cost-effectiveness was analysed on the basis of incremental net monetary benefit, which was based on quality-adjusted life-years (calculated using EQ-5D scores), and all medication expenditures consumed in 1 year. All analyses were also corrected for possible confounders. RESULTS: Of 144 randomised patients, 5 were excluded and 139 started taking abatacept (43 patients), rituximab (46 patients) or a different TNFi (50 patients). There were no significant differences between the three groups with respect to multiple measures of RA outcomes. However, our analysis revealed that rituximab therapy is significantly more cost-effective than both abatacept and TNFi over a willingness-to-pay range of 0 to 80,000 euros. CONCLUSIONS: All three treatment options were similarly effective; however, when costs were factored into the treatment decision, rituximab was the best option available to patients whose first TNFi treatment failed. However, generalization of these costs to other countries should be undertaken carefully. TRIAL REGISTRATION: Netherlands Trial Register number NTR1605. Registered 24 December 2008.",

The mean serum IL-33 levels had decreased significantly at 3 and 6 months after the initial treatment with etanercept. Serum IL-33 levels showed a significant correlation with the number of tender joints, CRP, DAS28-CRP, and the WBC count, and an inverse correlation with the RBC count and Hb level. These findings indicated that the decrease of serum IL-33 levels was a novel function of etanercept, shown for the first time in this study.

METHODS: The Canadian Early Arthritis Cohort (CATCH) is a national, multicenter, observational, prospective cohort of patients with early inflammatory arthritis, receiving usual care, recruited since 2007. Inclusion criteria include age > 16 years; symptom duration 6-52 weeks; swelling of >= 2 joints or >= 1 metacarpophalangeal\/proximal interphalangeal joint; and 1 of rheumatoid factor >= 20 IU, positive anticitrullinated protein antibodies (ACPA), morning stiffness >= 45 min, response to nonsteroidal antiinflammatory drug, or positive metatarsophalangeal joint squeeze test. Data from patients enrolled to March 15, 2011, were analyzed. RESULTS: In total, 1450 patients met the eligibility criteria (1187 were followed). At baseline, mean age was 53 +\/- 15 years, symptom duration was 6.1 +\/- 3.2 months, Disease Activity Score (DAS28) was 4.9 +\/- 1.6, Health Assessment Questionnaire-Disability Index was 1.0 +\/- 0.7. Forty-one percent (n = 450) of patients had moderate (3.2 < DAS28 <= 5.1) and 46% (n = 505) had high (DAS28 > 5.1) disease activity; 28% of those with baseline radiographs (n = 250\/908) had radiographic evidence of erosions. ACPA status was available for 70% (n = 831) of patients; 55% (n = 453) tested positive. Sixty percent (n = 718) of patients were treated with methotrexate (MTX) initially. Of 612 patients without erosions, 63% and 83% fulfilled 1987 and 2010 RA classification criteria, respectively. Seventy-three percent (n = 166) of those who did not fulfill 1987 criteria were newly identified by the 2010 criteria. These patients had less severe disease and more were MTX-naive compared to those satisfying the 1987 criteria. Forty-seven percent of all patients achieved remission at 1 year. CONCLUSION: Patients with early RA present with moderate high disease activity; < 50% achieve remission at 1 year, despite MTX treatment in the majority. The 2010 RA classification criteria identify more patients with RA who would previously have been designated as having undifferentiated disease. However, these patients have lower disease activity at the time of identification.",

Eighty patients who at baseline had active RA (mean tender\/painful joint count 29.4, mean swollen joint count 17.4, mean erythrocyte sedimentation rate 25.1 mm\/hour) despite treatment for >\/=1 month with a stable, maximally tolerated dosage of oral MTX (<\/=20 mg\/week, median dosage 15 mg\/week, range 5-20 mg\/week) were enrolled and received 3 mg\/day tacrolimus as a single oral dose once per day for 6 months while continuing to receive MTX at the existing stable dosage. All other disease-modifying antirheumatic drugs were discontinued; stable dosage of nonsteroidal antiinflammatory drugs and oral corticosteroids (<\/=10 mg\/day prednisone or its equivalent) were allowed. All 80 patients received at least one dose of the study drug and were included in the primary safety and efficacy analyses. Seventy-five patients had at least one postbaseline efficacy assessment, and 63 patients (78.8%) completed the study. The primary clinical response criterion was the American College of Rheumatology definition of 20% improvement (ACR20) at the end of treatment. RESULTS: Seven patients (12.5%) withdrew from the study because of adverse events possibly or probably related to treatment with tacrolimus, and 4 (5.0%) withdrew due to lack of efficacy. One serious adverse event (pancreatitis) was possibly related to tacrolimus treatment. The mean (+\/-SD) creatinine (Cr) level increased from 0.74 +\/- 0.16 mg\/dl at baseline to 0.81 +\/- 0.22 mg\/dl (P < 0.001) at the end of treatment. Twenty-three patients (28.8%) had a >\/=30% maximum increase in the Cr level from baseline during the study, with the Cr level in 3 patients (3.8%) exceeding the range considered normal for their age and sex. The maximum Cr level during the study was 1.8 mg\/dl. The ACR20 clinical response rate at the end of treatment was 52.5% (95% confidence interval 41.6-63.4%).

        "Published":"2005 Oct",
        "Abstract":"OBJECTIVE: The immune system of patients with rheumatoid arthritis (RA) is characterized by the accumulation of CD4+ T cells deficient in CD28 expression and the up-regulation of tumor necrosis factor alpha (TNFalpha). Previous in vitro studies have shown that TNFalpha induces transcriptional silencing of the CD28 gene. Because reduced expression of CD28 in T cells compromises immunocompetence, we examined whether CD28 expression is reduced in patients with RA in vivo and whether the reduction is related to TNFalpha. METHODS: Patients with RA and age-matched individuals were recruited. Peripheral blood mononuclear cells were stained for CD3, CD4, CD8, CD28, TNF receptor I (TNFRI), and TNFRII, and analyzed by quantitative flow cytometry. The number of CD28 and TNFR molecules was monitored in a subgroup of patients with RA undergoing treatment with anti-TNFalpha. RESULTS: In addition to higher frequencies of CD28null T cells, patients with RA had significantly reduced numbers of CD28 and TNFRI molecules on CD4+,CD28+ T cells. Normal expression could be restored in vitro by overnight culture, suggesting that CD28 in patients was modulated by exogenous factors. In contrast, treatment with TNFalpha in vitro resulted in further down-regulation. CD28 expression was normalized in patients undergoing TNFalpha-neutralizing therapy. CONCLUSION: Overproduction of TNFalpha in RA induces a global down-regulation of CD28 in CD4+ T cells and may cause reduced sensitivity to costimulatory signals in T cell responses.",

        "Published":"2011 Jun",
        "Abstract":"OBJECTIVES: The mechanism of action of treatment with tumour necrosis factor (TNF) blockers in rheumatoid arthritis (RA) is still not completely understood. The aim of this study was to test if adalimumab treatment could affect the influx of monocytes into the synovium. METHODS: A novel technique was used to analyse the migration of labelled autologous monocytes before and 14 days after initiation of adalimumab treatment using scintigraphy. CD14 monocytes were isolated from patients with RA, using a positive selection procedure with magnetic-activated cell sorting, and labelled with technetium-99m-hexamethylpropylene-amino-oxime. Scintigraphic scans were made 1, 2 and 3 h after re-infusion. RESULTS: As early as 14 days after the start of treatment with adalimumab a significant decrease in disease activity score evaluated in 28 joints was shown. There was no significant decrease in the influx of monocytes into the joint at this time. CONCLUSIONS: This study indicates that adalimumab treatment does not reduce the influx of monocytes into the synovium early after initiation of treatment. As previous studies showed a rapid decrease in macrophage infiltration after TNF-antibody therapy, which could not be explained by increased cell death, this points to an important role for enhanced efflux of inflammatory cells from the synovium.",

        "Published":"2009 Sep",
        "Abstract":"OBJECTIVE: To review the pharmacology, pharmacokinetics, pharmacodynamics, safety, efficacy, and use of denosumab in osteoporosis, breast cancer, prostate cancer, and multiple myeloma. DATA SOURCES: Studies and abstracts were identified through MEDLINE and International Pharmaceutical Abstracts (1966-July 2009). Key search terms include denosumab, AMG-162, and receptor activator of nuclear factor-kappaB ligand system. Information available in abstract form was retrieved from major oncology and bone metabolism meetings. Additional data were obtained from the manufacturer. STUDY SELECTION AND DATA EXTRACTION: All available studies in humans were included except for studies in rheumatoid arthritis and giant cell tumor of the bone. DATA SYNTHESIS: In patients with osteoporosis, denosumab significantly reduces bone resorption and fractures. Studies of denosumab in the prevention and treatment of osteoporosis have demonstrated significantly increased bone mineral density and reduced bone turnover markers. Studies of denosumab versus placebo in the treatment of osteoporosis have demonstrated reductions in vertebral, hip, and nonvertebral fractures. In oncology, positive results from clinical trials in patients receiving endocrine therapy for breast and prostate cancer demonstrated decreases in bone loss and skeletal-related events. Denosumab seems to be at least as effective in reducing bone turnover markers as intravenous bisphosphonates in the oncology setting. The most common adverse effects in patients with osteoporosis were arthralgia, nasopharyngitis, back pain, and headache. The most common adverse effects in patients with cancer were infection, pain in the extremities, arthralgia, bone pain, fatigue, and pain. Serious adverse effects include infections requiring hospitalization. CONCLUSIONS: Denosumab has documented efficacy and safety in patients with osteoporosis, breast cancer, and prostate cancer. Additional clinical trial data are needed to more completely establish the effectiveness of denosumab in the treatment of osteoporosis and neoplastic disease as well as its cost-effectiveness and long-term safety.

        "Published":"2010 Jan",
        "Abstract":"OBJECTIVE: Dkk-1 is an inhibitory molecule that regulates the Wnt pathway, which controls osteoblastogenesis. This study was undertaken to explore the potential role of Dkk-1 in ankylosing spondylitis (AS), a prototypical bone-forming disease. METHODS: Serum Dkk-1 levels were measured in 45 patients with AS, 45 patients with rheumatoid arthritis (RA), 15 patients with psoriatic arthritis (PsA), and 50 healthy subjects by sandwich enzyme-linked immunosorbent assay (ELISA). A functional ELISA was used to assess the binding of Dkk-1 to its receptor (low-density lipoprotein receptor-related protein 6). Furthermore, we studied the effect of sera from patients with AS and healthy subjects on the activity of the Wnt pathway in the Jurkat T cell model, with and without a neutralizing anti-Dkk-1 monoclonal antibody, by Western immunoblotting. RESULTS: Serum Dkk-1 levels were significantly increased in patients with AS (mean +\/- SEM 2,730 +\/- 135.1 pg\/ml) as compared with normal subjects (P = 0.040), patients with RA (P = 0.020), and patients with PsA (P = 0.049). Patients with AS receiving anti-tumor necrosis factor alpha (anti-TNFalpha) treatment had significantly higher serum Dkk-1 levels than patients with AS not receiving such treatment (P = 0.007). Patients with AS studied serially prior to and following anti-TNFalpha administration exhibited a significant increase in serum Dkk-1 levels (P = 0.020), in contrast to patients with RA, who exhibited a dramatic decrease (P < 0.001). Jurkat cells treated with serum from AS patients exhibited increased Wnt signaling compared with cells treated with control serum. In that system, Dkk-1 blockade significantly enhanced Wnt signaling in control serum-treated, but not AS serum-treated, Jurkat T cells. CONCLUSION: Our findings indicate that in patients with AS, circulating bone formation-promoting factors functionally prevail. This can be at least partially attributed to decreased Dkk-1-mediated inhibition.",

        "Published":"1985 Nov",
        "Abstract":"Pulsed methylprednisolone (PMP) has been shown to produce clinical improvement and reduction in the ESR and acute phase protein concentrations in patients with active rheumatoid arthritis and has been advocated for use either as an alternative to slow-acting antirheumatoid drugs (SAARDs) or in conjunction with SAARDs to accelerate the response to treatment. To test these potential roles for PMP 45 patients with active RA were randomly allocated to treatment with PMP alone, PMP + sulphasalazine (SAS - at a maintenance dose of 2.0 g\/day), or PMP + D-penicillamine (DPA - at a maintenance dose of 500 mg\/day). In each case three 1 g intravenous infusions were given on alternate days during the first week of the trial. Patients were monitored for 24 weeks by standard clinical and laboratory measurements. All three treatment groups showed significant clinical and laboratory improvements at two weeks. With PMP + DPA and PMP + SAS these improvements were sustained and were not significantly different in these two treatment groups. However, in the 'PMP only' group ESR and CRP rose to pretreatment values by eight weeks. Twelve patients withdrew from the study owing to a relapse of the RA. No serious adverse effects were seen in the 'PMP only' group. Both combination regimens were well tolerated; adverse effects seen were attributable to either DPA or SAS. We conclude that PMP alone is insufficient for treatment of RA but can be used successfully in combination with either DPA or SAS. A comparison between these results obtained from two previous groups of 15 patients treated with DPA alone and SAS alone (using the same study design) shows that PMP accelerated the response to therapy by at least six weeks.",

Apart from this, the patient also showed clinical signs of obstructive sleep apnea syndrome that was confirmed by polysomnographic study. After infliximab treatment, additional sleep studies revealed an increase in the number of apneic events and SaO2 dips suggesting that TNFalpha plays an important role in the pathophysiology of sleep apnea. Thus, clinical recognition of sleep disordered breathing should be taken into account when rheumatoid arthritis patients are to be treated with infliximab.",

        "Published":"2014 Aug",
        "Abstract":"OBJECTIVES: To evaluate the efficacy and safety of subcutaneous golimumab as add-on therapy in patients with active rheumatoid arthritis (RA) despite disease-modifying antirheumatic drug (DMARD) treatment. To evaluate an intravenous plus subcutaneous (IV+SC) golimumab strategy in patients who had not attained remission. METHODS: GO-MORE was an open-label, multinational, prospective study in patients with active RA in typical clinical practice settings. In part 1, patients received add-on monthly 50-mg subcutaneous golimumab for 6 months. The percentage of patients with good\/moderate European League Against Rheumatism (EULAR) 28-joint disease activity score (DAS28)-erythrocyte sedimentation rate (ESR) response was compared in patient subgroups with various concurrent or previous DMARD treatments. In part 2, patients with EULAR responses but not remission were randomly assigned to receive IV+SC or subcutaneous golimumab to month 12; DAS28-ESR remission was measured. RESULTS: 3366 patients were enrolled. At baseline of part 1, 3280 efficacy-evaluable patients had mean disease duration of 7.6 years and mean DAS28-ESR of 5.97 (SD=1.095). At month 6, 82.1% achieved good\/moderate EULAR responses and 23.9% attained remission. When EULAR responses were analysed by the number of previously failed DMARD or the concomitant methotrexate dose, DMARD type, or corticosteroid use, no statistically significant differences were observed. Part 2 patients (N=490) who received IV+SC or subcutaneous golimumab achieved similar remission rates (~25%). Adverse events were consistent with previous reports of golimumab and other tumour necrosis antagonists in this population. CONCLUSIONS: Add-on monthly subcutaneous golimumab resulted in good\/moderate EULAR response in most patients; 25% achieved remission after 6 more months of golimumab, but an IV+SC regimen provided no additional efficacy over the subcutaneous regimen.
