        "b": "Risk of bias for this observational study was carried out using The Newcastle-Ottawa Scale (NOS) for assessing the quality of non-randomized studies in meta-analyses. The study received maximum score on all items except one. There is no data on previous hemorrhagic events in the population, and hence no way to ascertain whether patients were not treated due to previous hemorrhagic events. This may introduce bias, since the reason for not anticoagulating may be affected by this. See Supplementary table S4 for further detail.",
