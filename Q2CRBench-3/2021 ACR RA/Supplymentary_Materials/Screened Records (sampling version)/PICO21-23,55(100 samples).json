        "Published":"2009 Apr",
        "Abstract":"Disease-modifying antirheumatic drugs (DMARDs) improve the disability and slow the progression of the joint damage in rheumatoid arthritis (RA). However, a large proportion of patients experience inefficacy by the end of 2 years. This loss of efficacy may be due to expression of multidrug resistance (MDR) proteins on lymphocytes. The objective is to study the expression of MDR protein on the peripheral blood lymphocytes in patients with RA and correlate it with the disease status and response to treatment. Twenty-eight patients were enrolled. Expression of MDR-1 by flow cytometry was carried out on lymphocytes at baseline and after 4 months of therapy. This expression was correlated with disease activity scores (DAS 28). There were 25 females with mean age of 48.13 years and median disease duration of 48 months. Eighteen patients were DMARD naive and ten were refractory to DMARD (methotrexate). The percentage of cells expressing MDR-1 in the DMARD-naive (p<0.O5) and DMARD-refractory (p<0.05) groups were significantly higher than the healthy controls at the baseline. The relative fluorescence intensity was significantly higher in the DMARD-refractory group (p<0.05) as compared to the DMARD-naive group. After 4 months of therapy, there was significant improvement in the D value (p<0.01) in the DMARD-naive group (treated with methotrexate only) and DMARD-refractory group (p<0.05). A significant correlation (r=0.563) between the DAS 28 scores and the D value (p=0.003) was observed. Expression of MDR-1 in RA correlated with disease activity status and improved with DMARD therapy. It is not related to the refractoriness to therapy with methotrexate.",

        "Published":"2014 Apr",
        "Abstract":"OBJECTIVE: Anaemia in rheumatoid arthritis (RA) is prototypical of the chronic disease type and is often neglected in clinical practice. We studied anaemia in relation to disease activity, medications and radiographic progression. METHODS: Data were collected between 1996 and 2007 over a mean follow-up of 2.2 years. Anaemia was defined according to WHO ( haemoglobin<12 g\/dl, : haemoglobin<13 g\/dl), or alternative criteria. Anaemia prevalence was studied in relation to disease parameters and pharmacological therapy. Radiographic progression was analysed in 9731 radiograph sets from 2681 patients in crude longitudinal regression models and after adjusting for potential confounding factors, including the clinical disease activity score with the 28-joint count for tender and swollen joints and erythrocyte sedimentation rate (DAS28ESR) or the clinical disease activity index (cDAI), synthetic antirheumatic drugs and antitumour necrosis factor (TNF) therapy. RESULTS: Anaemia prevalence decreased from more than 24% in years before 2001 to 15% in 2007. Erosions progressed significantly faster in patients with anaemia (p<0.001). Adjusted models showed these effects independently of clinical disease activity and other indicators of disease severity. Radiographic damage progression rates were increasing with severity of anaemia, suggesting a 'dose-response effect'. The effect of anaemia on damage progression was maintained in subgroups of patients treated with TNF blockade or corticosteroids, and without non-selective nonsteroidal anti-inflammatory drugs (NSAIDs). CONCLUSIONS: Anaemia in RA appears to capture disease processes that remain unmeasured by established disease activity measures in patients with or without TNF blockade, and may help to identify patients with more rapid erosive disease.",

        "Published":"2013 Mar",
        "Abstract":"PURPOSE: To determine the impact of the revised academy guidelines on screening for hydroxychloroquine retinopathy. DESIGN: Retrospective, observational cohort study. METHODS: setting: Private practice of 29 doctors. study population: Total of 183 patients for follow-up and 36 patients for baseline screening. observation procedure: Review of charts, 10-2 visual fields (VFs), multifocal electroretinograms (mfERG), and spectral-domain optical coherence tomography (SD-OCT) images before and after the revised guidelines. main outcome measure: Rates of use of ancillary tests and clinical intervention, costs of screening, follow-up schedules, and comparative sensitivity of tests. RESULTS: New hydroxychloroquine toxicity was found in 2 of 183 returning patients (1.1%). Dosing above 6.5 mg\/kg\/d was found in 28 of 219 patients (12.8%), an underestimate because patient height, weight, and daily dose were not determined in 77 (35.1%), 84 (38.4%), and 59 (26.9%), respectively. In 10 of the 28 (35.7%), the dose was reduced, in 2 (7.1%) hydroxychloroquine was stopped, but in 16 (57.1%) no action was taken. The cost of screening rose 40%\/patient after the revised guidelines. Fundus autofluorescence imaging was not used. No toxicity was detected by adding mfERG or SD-OCT. In no case was a 5-year period free of follow-up recommended after baseline screening in a low-risk patient. CONCLUSIONS: Detection of toxic daily dosing is a cost-effective way to reduce hydroxychloroquine toxicity, but height, weight, and daily dose were commonly not checked. The revised guidelines, emphasizing mfERG, SD-OCT, or FAF, raised screening cost without improving case detection. The recommended 5-year screening-free interval for low-risk patients after baseline examination was ignored. Copyright © 2013 Elsevier Inc. All rights reserved.",

        "Published":"2011 Mar",
        "Abstract":"The introduction of antitumor necrosis factor (TNF) agents has improved the outcome for many patients with rheumatoid arthritis (RA). To date, the only replicated genetic predictor of anti-TNF response is the -308 G > A single-nucleotide polymorphism in the TNF promoter region. The presence of the -308 TNF G\/G genotype appears to be a marker of good response to anti-TNF treatment. Anti-citrullinated protein antibodies (ACPA) have been linked with erosive disease, and have been established as the single most reliable prognostic factor in clinical practice. To test the hypothesis that the ACPA status may affect the -308 G\/G patients rate of response to TNF blockade, we prospectively investigated a group of 52 RA patients with the -308 G\/G genotype who were ACPA (+) or ACPA (-). All patients were treated with adalimumab, and the clinical response was studied using the Disease Activity Score in 28 joints (DAS28) at 24 weeks of treatment. Over 85% of patients were DAS28 responders in both groups. No significant differences were found between patients from both groups, according to the DAS28 criteria of response at week 24 (p = 0.79). In conclusion, our findings suggest that the ACPA status does not affect the clinical response to anti-TNF therapy in -308 TNF G\/G patients.",

Cervical and inguinal lymph node biopsies showed the features of severe necrotising lymphadenitis, associated with erythrophagocytosis and prominent eosinophilic infiltrates, without viral inclusion bodies, suggestive of an adverse drug reaction.A week later, fulminant drug-induced hepatitis, associated with the presence of anti-nuclear autoantibodies (but not with other markers of autoimmunity), and accompanied by multi-organ failure and sepsis, supervened. She subsequently died some 5 weeks after the commencement of her drug therapy.Post-mortem examination showed evidence of massive hepatocellular necrosis, acute hypersensitivity myocarditis, focal acute tubulo-interstitial nephritis and extensive bone marrow necrosis, with no evidence of malignancy.

        "Abstract":"Felty's syndrome (FS) comprises a triad of rheumatoid arthritis (RA), neutropenia and splenomegaly, occurring in less than 1% of RA patients. Clinically it is characterized by severe joint destruction contrasting with moderate or absent joint inflammation and severe extra-articular disease, including a high frequency of rheumatoid nodules, lymphadenopathy, hepatopathy, vasculitis, leg ulcers, skin pigmentation etc. Recurrent bacterial infections are mostly due to the severe, otherwise unexplained neutropenia. The cause of neutropenia lies in both decreased granulopoiesis and increased peripheral destruction of granulocytes. Recurrent infections may lead to increased mortality. Spontaneous remission of the syndrome also occurs. Over 95% of FS patients are positive for rheumatoid factor (RF), 47-100% are positive for antinuclear antibody (ANA), and 78% of patients have the HLA-DR4*0401 antigen. Some 30% of FS patients have large granular lymphocyte (LGL) expansion. LGL expansion associated with uncomplicated RA is immunogenetically and phenotypically very similar to but clinically different from FS. Neutropenia of FS can be effectively treated with disease-modifying anti-rheumatic drugs (DMARDs), the widest experience being with methotrexate (MTX). Results of treatment with granulocyte colony-stimulating factor (G-CSF) are encouraging, but there is no experience with other biological agents. Splenectomy results in immediate improvement of neutropenia in 80% of the patients, but the rate of infection decreases to a lesser degree. [References: 97]",

        "Abstract":"BACKGROUND: Effectiveness of anti-tumor necrosis factor (anti-TNF) agents in colchicine-resistant familial Mediterranean fever (FMF) patients has attracted attention in recent years. OBJECTIVE: We analyzed the effect of anti-TNF agents on clinical findings of colchicine-resistant FMF patients with chronic arthritis and\/or sacroiliitis. METHODS: Data from 10 FMF patients (5 male and 5 female patients: mean age, 30.1 [SD, 8.5] years) with chronic arthritis and\/or sacroiliitis who were on anti-TNF agents are reviewed. Frequency of FMF attacks before and after treatment with anti-TNF agents was recorded from hospital files. The effects of the anti-TNF treatment were determined by using the number of tender and\/or swollen joints, serum acute phase reactant levels, and Bath Ankylosing Spondylitis Disease Activity Index scores. Change in urine protein loss was also evaluated in patients with amyloidosis. In 6 patients, FMF attacks had been considered to be unresponsive to colchicine, and 4 patients were partial responders before treatment with anti-TNF agents. RESULTS: Mean attack frequency of the patients in the 3 months' period before anti-TNF agent treatment was 3.8 (SD, 3.1). After anti-TNF treatment, in 3 patients, FMF attack frequency decreased, and in the remaining 7 patients, no attack occurred. Serum acute phase reactant levels were decreased significantly at 3 and 6 months after anti-TNF treatment (P < 0.05 for all). After anti-TNF treatment Bath Ankylosing Spondylitis Disease Activity Index scores were also decreased significantly (6.2 [SD], 1.7 vs. 2.1 [SD], 1.7; P = 0.012). In all 3 patients with amyloidosis, urine protein loss decreased without any increase in serum creatinine levels. CONCLUSION: Anti-TNF treatment can have beneficial effects for controlling FMF attacks in FMF patients with chronic arthritis and\/or sacroiliitis.",

In particular, the structural benefit of therapy, previously shown in Japanese studies, has been confirmed in non-Japanese populations. Additional studies have identified markers, such as high titer rheumatoid factor, that may be associated with greater clinical response to this agent. While registry data with this therapy have not yet become available, more detailed analyses of clinical trial data have helped clarify the risk for certain toxicities, including infection and gastrointestinal perforation. Importantly, data have become available supporting the use of tocilizumab in diseases other than adult RA. Large clinical trials in systemic juvenile inflammatory arthritis have led to the approval of tocilizumab for this indication, and preliminary data suggests benefit in adult onset Still's disease. Finally, there is interest in the potential of IL-6 inhibition in other diseases, although meaningful data has not yet become available.",

        "Abstract":"OBJECTIVE: To evaluate the efficacy, pharmacokinetics, immunogenicity, and safety of multiple infusions of a chimeric monoclonal anti-tumor necrosis factor alpha antibody (cA2) (infliximab; Remicade, Centocor, Malvern, PA) given alone or in combination with low-dose methotrexate (MTX) in rheumatoid arthritis (RA) patients. METHODS: In a 26-week, double-blind, placebo-controlled, multicenter trial, 101 patients with active RA exhibiting an incomplete response or flare of disease activity while receiving low-dose MTX were randomized to 1 of 7 groups of 14-15 patients each. The patients received either intravenous cA2 at 1, 3, or 10 mg\/kg, with or without MTX 7.5 mg\/week, or intravenous placebo plus MTX 7.5 mg\/week at weeks 0, 2, 6, 10, and 14 and were followed up through week 26. RESULTS: Approximately 60% of patients receiving cA2 at 3 or 10 mg\/kg with or without MTX achieved the 20% Paulus criteria for response to treatment, for a median duration of 10.4 to >18.1 weeks (P < 0.001 versus placebo). Patients receiving cA2 at 1 mg\/kg without MTX became unresponsive to repeated infusions of cA2 (median duration 2.6 weeks; P=0.126 versus placebo). However, coadministration of cA2 at 1 mg\/kg with MTX appeared to be synergistic, prolonging the duration of the 20% response in >60% of patients to a median of 16.5 weeks (P < 0.001 versus placebo; P=0.006 versus no MTX) and the 50% response to 12.2 weeks (P < 0.001 versus placebo; P=0.002 versus no MTX). Patients receiving placebo infusions plus suboptimal low-dose MTX continued to have active disease, with a Paulus response lasting a median of 0 weeks. A 70-90% reduction in the swollen joint count, tender joint count, and C-reactive protein level was maintained for the entire 26 weeks in patients receiving 10 mg\/kg of cA2 with MTX. In general, treatment was well tolerated and stable blood levels of cA2 were achieved in all groups, except for the group receiving 1 mg\/kg of cA2 alone, at which dosage antibodies to cA2 were observed in approximately 50% of the patients. CONCLUSION: Multiple infusions of cA2 were effective and well tolerated, with the best results occurring at 3 and 10 mg\/kg either alone or in combination with MTX in approximately 60% of patients with active RA despite therapy with low-dose MTX. When cA2 at 1 mg\/kg was given with low-dose MTX, synergy was observed. The results of the trial provide a strategy for further evaluation of the efficacy and safety of longer-term treatment with cA2.",

        "Abstract":"BACKGROUND: Tofacitinib is an oral Janus kinase inhibitor for the treatment of rheumatoid arthritis. The Oral Rheumatoid Arthritis triaL (ORAL) Strategy aimed to assess the comparative efficacy of tofacitinib monotherapy, tofacitinib plus methotrexate, and adalimumab plus methotrexate for the treatment of rheumatoid arthritis in patients with a previous inadequate response to methotrexate. METHODS: ORAL Strategy was a 1 year, double-blind, phase 3b\/4, head-to-head, non-inferiority, randomised controlled trial in patients aged 18 years or older with active rheumatoid arthritis despite methotrexate therapy. Patients were randomly assigned (1:1:1) to receive oral tofacitinib (5 mg twice daily) monotherapy, oral tofacitinib (5 mg twice daily) plus methotrexate, or subcutaneous adalimumab (40 mg every other week) plus methotrexate at 194 centres in 25 countries. Eligible patients received live zoster vaccine at investigators' discretion. The primary endpoint was the proportion of patients who attained an American College of Rheumatology response of at least 50% (ACR50) at month 6 in the full analysis set (patients who were randomly assigned to a group and received at least one dose of the study treatment). Non-inferiority between groups was shown if the lower bound of the 98.34% CI of the difference between comparators was larger than -13.0%. This trial is registered with ClinicalTrials.gov, number NCT02187055. FINDINGS: 1146 patients received treatment (384 had tofacitinib monotherapy; 376 had tofacitinib and methotrexate; and 386 had adalimumab and methotrexate). At 6 months, ACR50 response was attained in 147 (38%) of 384 patients with tofacitinib monotherapy, 173 (46%) of 376 patients with tofacitinib and methotrexate, and 169 (44%) of 386 patients with adalimumab and methotrexate. Non-inferiority was declared for tofacitinib and methotrexate versus adalimumab and methotrexate (difference 2% [98.34% CI -6 to 11]) but not for tofacitinib monotherapy versus either adalimumab and methotrexate (-6 [-14 to 3]) or tofacitinib and methotrexate (-8 [-16 to 1]). In total, 23 (6%) of 384 patients receiving tofacitinib monotherapy, 26 (7%) of 376 patients receiving tofacitinib plus methotrexate, and 36 (9%) of 386 patients receiving adalimumab plus methotrexate discontinued due to adverse events. Two (1%) of the 384 patients receiving tofacitinib monotherapy died. No new or unexpected safety issues were reported for either treatment in this study for up to 1 year. INTERPRETATION: Tofacitinib and methotrexate combination therapy was non-inferior to adalimumab and methotrexate combination therapy in the treatment of rheumatoid arthritis in patients with an inadequate response to methotrexate in this trial. Tofacitinib monotherapy was not shown to be non-inferior to either combination. FUNDING: Pfizer Inc. Copyright © 2017 Elsevier Ltd. All rights reserved.",

In the EU, abatacept is approved for use in patients with highly active and progressive rheumatoid arthritis (RA) not previously treated with methotrexate. Abatacept is also approved for the treatment of moderate to severe active RA in patients with an inadequate response to previous therapy with at least one conventional DMARD (cDMARD), including methotrexate or a TNF inhibitor. In phase III trials, beneficial effects on RA signs and symptoms, disease activity, structural damage progression and physical function were seen with intravenous (IV) or subcutaneous (SC) abatacept regimens, including abatacept plus methotrexate in methotrexate-naive patients with early RA and poor prognostic factors, and abatacept plus methotrexate or other cDMARDs in patients with inadequate response to methotrexate or TNF inhibitors. Benefits were generally maintained during longer-term follow-up. Absolute drug-free remission rates following withdrawal of all RA treatments were significantly higher with abatacept plus methotrexate than with methotrexate alone. Both IV and SC abatacept were generally well tolerated, with low rates of immunogenicity. Current evidence therefore suggests that abatacept is a useful treatment option for patients with RA.",

Among 527 RA patients treated with TCZ, 63 patients were enrolled who switched TCZ to alternative biologic agents because of moderate or high disease activity assessed by the Clinical Disease Activity Index (CDAI). They were divided into two groups, TNF inhibitors (TNFi) or abatacept (ABT), and compared for clinical effectiveness and adverse events at week 24. Forty-two were switched to TNFi, and 21 to ABT. TNFi included 19 infliximab, 3 adalimumab, 8 etanercept, 9 golimumab, and 3 certolizumab-pegol. Baseline characteristics at the switch were comparable except for the concomitant methotrexate use (TNFi 71.4 vs ABT 28.6 %, P = 0.003). The proportion of patients achieving CDAI <= 10 (remission or low disease activity) at week 24 was significantly higher in TNFi than ABT (64.3 vs 23.8 %, P = 0.003), and the values of the CDAI at week 24 was significantly better in TNFi than ABT (mean, 11.8 vs 16.4, P = 0.021) although the drug retention rate was not different between the two groups (73.8 vs 71.4 %, P = 0.803). No serious adverse event was observed in both groups. TNFi may be more effective than ABT to achieve clinical remission or low disease activity after insufficient response to TCZ in patients with RA, although drug retention rate and safety are comparable.",

        "Abstract":"Methotrexate (MTX), an antifolate drug, is the first-line disease-modifying agent for the treatment of rheumatoid arthritis (RA) worldwide. MTX has excellent long-term efficacy, tolerability and safety. Early initiation of MTX in patients with RA controls joint destruction and slows progression of disease. However, the clinical response to MTX and frequency of adverse effects from the drug exhibit marked interpatient variability. Over the past decade, there has been a quest to identify genetic markers that reliably predict MTX efficacy and toxicity and help optimize MTX therapy in RA; that is, the field of MTX pharmacogenetics. This review will summarize key pharmacogenetic studies examining SNPs in the genes encoding enzymes in the MTX cellular pathway and their association with MTX response in RA. As evident from this review, MTX pharmacogenetics in RA remains a muddled field, mostly due to inconsistent results from several small underpowered studies.",

        "Published":"2016 12",
        "Abstract":"OBJECTIVE: To assess whether the time between the last rituximab infusion and initiation of a different biologic agent influenced infection risk in patients with rheumatoid arthritis (RA). METHODS: Patients with RA who newly initiated rituximab within the Consortium of Rheumatology Researchers of North America registry were included if they switched to a nonrituximab biologic agent and had >=1 followup visit within 12 months of switching. Patients were categorized by duration of time between their last rituximab infusion and initiation of a subsequent biologic agent (<=5 months, 6-11 months, and >=12 months). The primary outcome was time to first infectious event. Adjusted Cox regression models estimated the association between time to starting a subsequent biologic agent and infection. RESULTS: A total of 44 overall infections (7 serious, 37 nonserious) were reported during the 12-month followup in the 215 patients included in this analysis (104 switched at <=5 months, 67 at 6-11 months, and 44 at >=12 months). Median (interquartile range) time to infection was 4 (2-5) months. Infection rates per patient-year in the <=5-month, 6-11-month, and >=12-month groups were 0.34 (95% confidence interval [95% CI] 0.22-0.52), 0.30 (95% CI 0.17-0.52), and 0.41 (95% CI 0.22-0.77), respectively. After adjustment, time to switch to a subsequent biologic agent was not associated with infection, which remained unchanged when number and rate of rituximab retreatments were included in the models. CONCLUSION: In this real-world cohort of patients with RA, infection rates ranged from 0.30 to 0.41 per patient-year, with no significant difference in the rate between patients who initiated a subsequent biologic agent earlier versus later after rituximab treatment.

        "Published":"2016 12 03",
        "Abstract":"BACKGROUND: To prevent debilitating and irreversible joint damage, rheumatoid arthritis (RA) is often treated with tumor necrosis factor inhibitor (TNFi), but many patients do not respond to this costly therapy. Few predictors for response are known, and it has been proposed that genetic factors which influence the development of RA may also influence disease severity and response to therapy. Several previous studies have attempted to confirm this but results remain inconclusive. We expand on previous studies by including more RA risk alleles, and maximize power by combining them into a genetic risk score. METHOD: We linked genotyped RA patients from the Epidemiological Investigation of Rheumatoid Arthritis study to the Swedish Rheumatology Quality Register, identifying patients who started a TNFi as their first biological disease-modifying anti-rheumatic drug, with a return visit within 2-8 months after treatment start (N = 867). We calculated risk scores from 76 established RA risk SNPs, and four HLA-DRB1 amino acid positions, and tested whether risk scores or individual genetic risk factors could predict the European League Against Rheumatism (EULAR) response. RESULTS: We found no association between any of the risk scores or HLA-DRB1 haplotypes and EULAR response, neither overall nor stratified by anti-citrullinated protein\/peptide antibody (ACPA) status. When evaluating each of the 76 SNPs, we found that the number of SNPs presenting significant associations was not higher than expected by chance (5\/76 SNPs had p < 0.05 in ACPA-positive RA, 4\/76 in ACPA-negative RA). CONCLUSION: Overall, known RA risk SNPs do not predict response to TNFi, either individually or when combined into a risk score. This does not support the hypothesis that genes influencing RA onset would also influence its prognosis and treatment response.",

(The response was defined by the presence of Disease Activity Score-28 joint count (DAS28) >or=3.2 or a combination of >or=5 swollen joints, >or=5 painful joints and erythrocyte sedimentation rate >or=10 mm\/h.) METHODS: Patients with active rheumatoid arthritis taking MTX >or=12.5 mg\/week for >or=3 months were included in this 16 week, randomised, open-label study. Patients were randomly assigned to either ETN (25 mg subcutaneous injection twice weekly) added to the baseline dose of MTX or ETN monotherapy. RESULTS: 315 patients were randomised to ETN (n = 160) or ETN plus MTX (n = 155). The primary end point, DAS28 (4) improvement of >1.2 units, was achieved by 72.8% and 75.2% of patients treated with ETN and those treated with ETN plus MTX, respectively, with no significant difference (p = 0.658) between the two groups.

The rates of adverse and serious adverse events were similar between the treatment groups. CONCLUSION: Both the addition of ETN to MTX and the substitution of ETN for MTX in patients with rheumatoid arthritis who had an inadequate response to MTX resulted in substantial improvements in clinical signs and symptoms and were generally well-tolerated treatment strategies for improving clinical signs and symptoms of rheumatoid arthritis.",

        "Published":"2018 10 15",
        "Abstract":"BACKGROUND: We previously identified, in newly diagnosed rheumatoid arthritis (RA) patients, networks of co-expressed genes and proteomic biomarkers associated with achieving sustained drug-free remission (sDFR) after treatment with tocilizumab- or methotrexate-based strategies. The aim of this study was to identify, within the same patients, metabolic pathways important for achieving sDFR and to subsequently study the complex interactions between different components of the biological system and how these interactions might affect the therapeutic response in early RA. METHODS: Serum samples were analyzed of 60 patients who participated in the U-Act-Early trial (ClinicalTrials.gov number NCT01034137) and initiated treatment with methotrexate, tocilizumab, or the combination and who were thereafter able to achieve sDFR (n = 37); as controls, patients were selected who never achieved a drug-free status (n = 23). Metabolomic measurements were performed using mass spectrometry on oxidative stress, amine, and oxylipin platforms covering various compounds. Partial least square discriminant analyses (PLSDA) were performed to identify, per strategy arm, relevant metabolites of which the biological pathways were studied. In addition, integrative analyses were performed correlating the previously identified transcripts and proteins with the relevant metabolites. RESULTS: In the tocilizumab plus methotrexate, tocilizumab, and methotrexate strategy, respectively, 19, 13, and 12 relevant metabolites were found, which were subsequently used for pathway analyses. The most significant pathway in the tocilizumab plus methotrexate strategy was \"histidine metabolism\" (p < 0.001); in the tocilizumab strategy it was \"arachidonic acid metabolism\" (p = 0.018); and in the methotrexate strategy it was \"arginine and proline metabolism\" (p = 0.022). These pathways have treatment-specific drug interactions with metabolites affecting either the signaling of interleukin-6, which is inhibited by tocilizumab, or affecting protein synthesis from amino acids, which is inhibited by methotrexate. CONCLUSION: In early RA patients treated-to-target with a tocilizumab- or methotrexate-based strategy, several metabolites were found to be associated with achieving sDFR. In line with our previous observations, by analyzing relevant transcripts and proteins within the same patients, the metabolic profiles were found to be different between the strategy arms. Our metabolic analysis further supports the hypothesis that achieving sDFR is not only dependent on predisposing biomarkers, but also on the specific treatment that has been initiated.

We aimed to investigate the severity of acute HEV infection and the risk of chronic viral replication in patients with inflammatory arthritides treated with immunosuppressive drugs. All rheumatology and internal medicine practitioners belonging to the Club Rhumatismes et Inflammation in France were sent newsletters asking for reports of HEV infection and inflammatory arthritides. Baseline characteristics of patients and the course of HEV infection were retrospectively assessed by use of a standardized questionnaire. From January 2010 to August 2013, we obtained reports of 23 cases of HEV infection in patients with rheumatoid arthritis (n = 11), axial spondyloarthritis (n = 5), psoriatic arthritis (n = 4), other types of arthritides (n = 3). Patients received methotrexate (n = 16), antitumor necrosis factor alpha agents (n = 10), rituximab (n = 4), abatacept (n = 2), tocilizumab (n = 2), and corticosteroids (n = 10, median dose 6 mg\/d, range 2-20). All had acute hepatitis: median aspartate and alanine aminotransferase levels were 679 and 1300 U\/L, respectively. Eleven patients were asymptomatic, 4 had jaundice. The HEV infection diagnosis relied on positive PCR results for HEV RNA (n = 14 patients) or anti-HEV IgM positivity (n = 9). Median follow-up was 29 months (range 3-55). Treatment included discontinuation of immunosuppressants for 20 patients and ribavirin treatment for 5. Liver enzyme levels normalized and immunosuppressant therapy could be reinitiated in all patients. No chronic infection was observed. Acute HEV infection should be considered in patients with inflammatory rheumatism and elevated liver enzyme values. The outcome of HEV infection seems favorable, with no evolution to chronic hepatitis or fulminant liver failure.",

        "Abstract":"OBJECTIVE: TNF-alpha increases expression of inducible nitric oxide synthase (iNOS) in macrophages and vascular endothelial cells. Under normal conditions, iNOS activity is very low. However, iNOS activity is stimulated during inflammation by cytokines such as TNF-alpha and the amount of NO produced by iNOS may be a 1,000-fold greater than that produced by endothelial NOS. Since functional iNOS gene polymorphisms have been associated with susceptibility to rheumatoid arthritis (RA), drugs blocking TNF-alpha might decrease production of cytotoxic concentrations of NO leading to beneficial effect on RA or its complications. In the present study we investigated whether the infusion of the anti-TNF-alpha-infliximab may yield a short-term effect altering circulating NO oxidation products in patients with severe RA. METHODS: We investigated 33 RA patients on periodical treatment with infliximab. Serum levels of nitrates, nitrites and NOx (nitrites+nitrates) were determined immediately prior to and after infliximab infusion. Correlation with clinical variables, laboratory markers of inflammation, metabolic syndrome features, adipokines and adhesion molecules was also assessed. RESULTS: Upon infliximab administration, serum NOx concentrations (microM) decreased significantly ([mean+\/-SD: 15.0+\/-8.8; median: 11.9; interquartile range: 9.2-18.5] before infliximab-time 0 (baseline) and [12.9+\/-6.3; 10.9; 7.8-17.2] after infliximab infusion-time 120 minutes; p=0.03). It was also the case for nitrates (9.8+\/- 8.3; 7.6; 5.5-10.2] before infliximab and [7.5+\/-4.0; 6.6; 5.2-10.0] after infliximab infusion; p=0.008). There was a positive correlation between basal levels of nitrites and leptin concentration prior to infliximab administration. However, no significant correlations between NO oxidation products and clinical or other laboratory variables were found. CONCLUSIONS: Our results show, for the first time, a short-term effect of anti-TNF-alpha therapy on the levels of nitric oxide production.",

Forced vital capacity (FVC) remained stable in the majority of patients [mean annual change +0.8% (5-95 PC -8.1 to +14.0) of calculated normal value]. In addition, transfer factor using the indicator gas CO (TL,CO) was unaltered in most patients [mean annual change -2.1% (5-95 PC -16.2 to +11.8) of predicted value]. However, there were significant decreases in the forced expiratory volume in 1 s (FEV1) before and after inhalation of 0.2 mg salbutamol [mean annual change -0.8% (5-95 PC -8.4 to +3.2) and -1.3% (5-95 PC -7.8 to +3.9) of the FVC measured, respectively]. In addition, there were significant increases in alveolar-arterial Po2 gradients (P(A-a),O2) at rest and after exercise [mean annual change +1.7 mmHg (5-95 PC -5.2 to +12.2) and +1.8 mmHg (5-95 PC -3.5 to 9.0), respectively]. Nevertheless, the amounts were small in view of the reliability of the methods applied and reflect, at least in part, the normal process of ageing. The annual change in FEV1\/FVC was negatively correlated with FEV1\/FVC at baseline (Rs = -0.46, P < 0.001). The annual change in TL,CO was also negatively correlated with TL,CO at baseline (Rs = -0.31, P = 0.028). No other risk factors for deterioration of lung volumes or gas exchange were found, including mean weekly MTX dose, age, gender, smoking, presence of rheumatoid factor and pulmonary function at baseline. We conclude that MTX has no major effect on pulmonary function in the majority of patients and that there is no evidence that patients with pre-existing pulmonary disease are at increased risk for further deterioration of lung function.",

        "Abstract":"OBJECTIVE: Optimizing therapeutic strategies to induce remission requires an understanding of the initial features predicting remission. Currently no suitable model exists. We aim to develop a remission score using predictors of remission in early rheumatoid arthritis (RA). METHODS: We used a dataset from a UK randomized controlled trial that evaluated intensive treatment with conventional combination therapy, to develop a predictive model for 24-month remission. We studied 378 patients in the trial who received 24 months' treatment. Our model was validated using data from a UK observational cohort (Early RA Network, ERAN). A group of 194 patients was followed for 24 months. Remission was defined as 28-joint Disease Activity Score < 2.6. Logistic regression models were used to estimate the associations between remission and potential baseline predictors. RESULTS: Multivariate logistic regression analyses showed age, sex, and tender joint count (TJC) were independently associated with 24-month remission. The multivariate remission score developed using the trial data correctly classified 80% of patients. These findings were replicated using ERAN. The remission score has high specificity (98%) but low sensitivity (13%). Combining data from the trial and ERAN, we also developed a simplified remission score that showed that younger men with a TJC of 5 or lower were most likely to achieve 24-month remission. Remission was least likely in older women with high TJC. Rheumatoid factor, rheumatoid nodules, and radiographic damage did not predict remission. CONCLUSION: Remission can be predicted using a score based on age, sex, and TJC. The score is relevant in clinical trial and routine practice settings.",

        "Abstract":"We aimed to investigate whether delayed treatment with tumor necrosis factor (TNF) inhibitors in incomplete responders to synthetic disease-modifying anti-rheumatic drugs (DMARDs) was effective among patients with very early rheumatoid arthritis (RA) with poor prognosis factors. We examined 22 patients with very early RA who were positive for anti-cyclic citrullinated peptide antibodies or IgM-rheumatoid factor. The mean disease duration at entry was 14.1 weeks. A treat-to-target strategy, aiming at simplified disease activity index (SDAI) remission, was initiated with synthetic DMARDs. SDAI remission was not achieved in 9 of the 22 patients with synthetic DMARDs alone, and TNF inhibitors were added in these patients. SDAI values in these 9 patients were further examined for the following 6 months. The TNF inhibitors (infliximab 8, etanercept 1) were added at a mean interval of 34.1 weeks after the initiation of synthetic DMARDs. SDAI remission was achieved in 4 of the 9 patients (44.4%) at 3 months and in 8 of the 9 patients (88.9%) at 6 months after the introduction of the TNF inhibitors. Radiographic damage had not progressed in these patients. Delayed treatment with TNF inhibitors is effective and tolerable for patients with very early RA with poor prognosis factors.",

        "Abstract":"BACKGROUND: An open-label study indicated that selective depletion of B cells with the use of rituximab led to sustained clinical improvements for patients with rheumatoid arthritis. To confirm these observations, we conducted a randomized, double-blind, controlled study. METHODS: We randomly assigned 161 patients who had active rheumatoid arthritis despite treatment with methotrexate to receive one of four treatments: oral methotrexate (> or =10 mg per week) (control); rituximab (1000 mg on days 1 and 15); rituximab plus cyclophosphamide (750 mg on days 3 and 17); or rituximab plus methotrexate. Responses defined according to the criteria of the American College of Rheumatology (ACR) and the European League against Rheumatism (EULAR) were assessed at week 24 (primary analyses) and week 48 (exploratory analyses). RESULTS: At week 24, the proportion of patients with 50 percent improvement in disease symptoms according to the ACR criteria, the primary end point, was significantly greater with the rituximab-methotrexate combination (43 percent, P=0.005) and the rituximab-cyclophosphamide combination (41 percent, P=0.005) than with methotrexate alone (13 percent). In all groups treated with rituximab, a significantly higher proportion of patients had a 20 percent improvement in disease symptoms according to the ACR criteria (65 to 76 percent vs. 38 percent, P< or =0.025) or had EULAR responses (83 to 85 percent vs. 50 percent, P< or =0.004). All ACR responses were maintained at week 48 in the rituximab-methotrexate group. The majority of adverse events occurred with the first rituximab infusion: at 24 weeks, serious infections occurred in one patient (2.5 percent) in the control group and in four patients (3.3 percent) in the rituximab groups. Peripheral-blood immunoglobulin concentrations remained within normal ranges. CONCLUSIONS: In patients with active rheumatoid arthritis despite methotrexate treatment, a single course of two infusions of rituximab, alone or in combination with either cyclophosphamide or continued methotrexate, provided significant improvement in disease symptoms at both weeks 24 and 48.

We aimed to contribute to the safety profile of MTX by assessing its cumulative effect on renal filtration. A total of 52 RA adult female patients with normal baseline serum creatinine and GFR at the initial diagnosis of the disease were included. Group 1 (G1) included 30 patients (mean age 40.4 +\/- 4.4 years) on MTX and NSAIDS, while 22 RA patients (mean age 38.5 +\/- 8.2 years) who received NSAIDs only served as control group (G2). Renal function was assessed by GFR measurement using technetium diethylenetriamine-pentaacetic acid (Tc-99 m DTPA) at a point of the study time corresponding to disease duration. Twenty-one out of thirty (70 %) in G1 showed reduced GFR compared to 6\/22 (27.3 %) in G2 (P = 0.007), with 3.3 +\/- 0.5 % annual reduction in GFR. Reduced GFR in G1 showed significant negative correlation with age (r = -0.396, P = 0.005), MTX cumulative dose (r = -0.263, P = 0.049), MTX-intake duration (r = -0.293, P = 0.031) and NSAIDs-intake duration (r = -0.344, P = 0.014). Low-dose MTX has a slow cumulative effect on renal filtration manifested by GFR reduction overtime that could be monitored by Tc-99 m DTPA.",

        "Abstract":"OBJECTIVES: This study aims to examine the effects of tocilizumab therapy on serum levels of interleukin (IL)-33 and IL-6 in rheumatoid arthritis (RA) patients. PATIENTS AND METHODS: Interleukin-33 and IL-6 levels in serum samples from 83 RA patients (10 males, 73 females; mean age 51.9 years; range, 26 to 77 years) and 12 healthy controls (2 males, 10 females; mean age 52.2 years; range, 39 to 62 years) were compared by cross-sectional, case control analysis. Of the RA patients, 40 received 24 weeks of tocilizumab therapy and were assigned to the prospective cohort. These 40 patients were then divided into two subgroups as responders and non-responders according to the American College of Rheumatology (ACR) 20. The remaining 43 RA patients did not receive tocilizumab therapy. Serum cytokine levels were analyzed at baseline and after 24 weeks of tocilizumab therapy in these patients. RESULTS: Interleukin-33 and IL-6 concentrations were significantly higher in RA patients than in healthy controls (p<0.001 for both). Serum IL-33 levels in RA patients showed a significant correlation with rheumatoid factor titer (r=0.660, p<0.001), and IL-6 levels showed a significant correlation with high-sensitivity C-reactive protein levels (Spearman's rank correlation coefficient=0.482, p<0.001). Serum IL-33 levels decreased significantly after 24 weeks of tocilizumab therapy (p<0.001); this was particularly marked in ACR20 responders (p<0.001). However, the decrease in non-responders was not significant (p=0.066). Changes in serum IL-6 levels after 24 weeks of tocilizumab therapy were not significant in either ACR20 responders or non-responders. CONCLUSION: Serum IL-33 levels in RA patients receiving tocilizumab therapy decreased significantly, particularly in ACR20 responders. Thus, IL-33 may be a useful marker for monitoring responses to tocilizumab therapy.",

METHODS: 205 patients fulfilling the ACR criteria for rheumatoid arthritis (RA), not treated with disease modifying antirheumatoid drugs previously, with an early (< or = 1 year duration), active (Disease Activity Score (DAS) > 3.0), rheumatoid factor and\/or HLA DR 1\/4 positive disease were randomised between sulphasalazine (SASP) 2000 (maximum 3000) mg daily (n = 68), or methotrexate (MTX) 7.5 (maximum 15) mg weekly (n = 69) or the combination (SASP + MTX) of both (n = 68). RESULTS: The mean changes in the DAS during the one year follow up of the study was -1.15, -0.87, -1.26 in the SASP, MTX, and SASP + MTX group respectively (p = 0.019). However, there was no statistically significant difference in terms of either EULAR good responders 34%, 38%, 38% or ACR criteria responders 59%, 59%, 65% in the SASP, MTX, and SASP + MTX group respectively. Radiological progression evaluated by the modified Sharp score was very modest in the three groups: mean changes in erosion score: +2.4, +2.4, +1.9, in narrowing score: +2.3, +2.1, +1.6 and in total damage score: +4.6, +4.5, +3.5, in the SASP, MTX, and SASP + MTX groups respectively. Adverse events occurred more frequently in the SASP + MTX group 91% versus 75% in the SASP and MTX group (p = 0.025). Nausea was the most frequent side effect: 32%, 23%, 49% in the SASP, MTX, and SASP + MTX groups respectively (p = 0.007). CONCLUSION: This study suggests that an early initiation therapy of disease modifying drug seems to be of benefit.

        "Abstract":"PURPOSE: To investigate choroidal thickness in patients using hydroxychloroquine (HCQ) and compare choroidal thickness between eyes with and without HCQ retinopathy. DESIGN: Retrospective case series. METHODS: Setting: Institutional. PATIENTS: We included 124 patients with systemic lupus erythematosus or rheumatoid arthritis who were treated with HCQ. The patients were divided into an HCQ retinopathy group and a control group, according to the presence or absence of HCQ retinopathy. OBSERVATION: Total choroidal thickness and choriocapillaris-equivalent thickness were measured manually by 2 independent investigators using swept-source optical coherence tomography (SS-OCT; DRI-OCT, Topcon Inc, Tokyo, Japan). These measurements were made at the fovea and at nasal and temporal locations 0.5, 1.5, and 3 mm from the fovea. Medium-to-large vessel layer thickness was calculated accordingly. The thicknesses were compared between the HCQ retinopathy and control groups. We performed correlation analyses between choroidal thicknesses and details regarding HCQ use. MAIN OUTCOME MEASURES: Total choroidal thickness and choriocapillaris-equivalent thickness. RESULTS: Choroidal thicknesses were significantly decreased (P < .05) in the HCQ retinopathy group compared to the control group, except at the temporal choroid 1.5 mm from the fovea. Choriocapillaris-equivalent thicknesses were significantly different in all choroidal locations between the groups. In contrast, the medium-to-large vessel layer thickness was only significantly different at a few locations. The cumulative dose\/body weight was significantly correlated with subfoveal choroidal and choriocapillaris-equivalent thicknesses (both P = .001). The association between presence of HCQ retinopathy and choroidal thicknesses was also statistically significant after adjusting for age, diagnosis for HCQ use, refractive errors, and duration of HCQ use (P = .001 and P = .003 for subfoveal choroidal and choriocapillaris-equivalent thickness, respectively). CONCLUSIONS: These results all suggest that HCQ retinopathy is associated with choroidal thinning, especially in the choriocapillaris. Our results may suggest choroidal involvement of HCQ toxicity.

        "Abstract":"OBJECTIVE: Ocrelizumab, a humanized anti-CD20 monoclonal antibody, was studied in a first-in-human trial in rheumatoid arthritis (RA) patients receiving concomitant methotrexate (MTX). METHODS: The ACTION trial was a combined phase I\/II study of placebo plus MTX versus ocrelizumab plus MTX in 237 RA patients (intent-to-treat population). During phase I, 45 patients were treated with 1 of 5 escalating doses of study drug (infusions on days 1 and 15, 10-1,000 mg per each infusion). An additional 192 patients were randomized during phase II. Eligible patients had active disease, an inadequate response to treatment with at least MTX, rheumatoid factor positivity, and elevated levels of acute-phase reactants. The total study duration was 72 weeks. B cell pharmacodynamics over time was investigated. RESULTS: Baseline demographics were similar among the treatment groups. Based on the entire 72-week data set, the incidence of serious adverse events in the ocrelizumab-treated patients was 17.9%, as compared with 14.6% in placebo-treated patients. The incidence of serious infections was 2.0% in all ocrelizumab-treated patients and 4.9% in placebo-treated patients. Infusion-associated adverse events were mostly grade 1 or grade 2 and were more frequent around the time of the first infusion. No serious infusion-associated adverse events were reported in the ocrelizumab group. Evidence of clinical activity was observed at all doses evaluated. Peripheral B cell depletion after infusion was rapid at all doses, with earlier repletion of B cells at doses of 10 mg and 50 mg.

Data were analyzed from a double-blind, phase IIa trial in which 161 patients with active rheumatoid arthritis despite continuing methotrexate were randomized to methotrexate alone (10-25 mg\/wk), rituximab alone (single course: 1000 mg administered intravenously on days 1 and 15), rituximab plus cyclophosphamide (750 mg administered intravenously on days 3 and 17), or rituximab plus methotrexate. Serum samples for pharmacokinetic analysis were collected through 24 weeks, and peripheral circulating CD19+ B-cell levels were measured through 48 weeks. All treatments were generally well tolerated, with no clinically relevant excess of adverse events leading to withdrawal among patients who received rituximab compared with those who received methotrexate alone. The proportions of patients who achieved an American College of Rheumatology score of 50 at week 24 were 13% (methotrexate alone), 33% (rituximab alone), 41% (rituximab plus cyclophosphamide), and 43% (rituximab plus methotrexate). Peripheral B-cell depletion occurred by day 15 in all patients treated with rituximab. There was no relationship between B-cell depletion and clinical response. Recovery of peripheral B cells was variable and showed no relationship with return of disease activity in patients who responded to rituximab. The mean terminal half-life of rituximab was 19 to 22 days; pharmacokinetic parameters were similar whether rituximab was administered alone or with methotrexate or cyclophosphamide. Because the level of peripherally circulating B cells does not appear to correlate with a maintained clinical response in patients with rheumatoid arthritis, the timing of rituximab retreatment should be based on clinical symptoms rather than peripheral B-cell levels.",

        "Published":"2016 Feb",
        "Abstract":"INTRODUCTION: The purpose of the present study was to determine whether the abatacept autoinjector can be used by the intended population without patterns of preventable use errors, and is acceptable when assessed against key user needs. METHODS: Two independently conducted simulated-use studies, with no active drug administered, quantified use errors and evaluated the abatacept autoinjector and competitor devices on key attributes (comfort, control, ease of use, confidence of dose) and overall acceptability. Autoinjector preference was also assessed. Participants were patients with rheumatoid arthritis, caregivers, and healthcare professionals (HCPs). Participants were informed that a new rheumatoid arthritis autoinjector was being tested but were blinded to the intended drug and sponsor identity. RESULTS: In the formative (pre-validation) study (n = 54), two high-priority use errors occurred, both of which resulted from protocol non-compliance rather than mental confusion or physical limitations. In the summative (validation) study (n = 99), one high-priority use error occurred; this was deemed a simulated-use study artifact as participant behavior was guided by actual experience associated with the feel of drug delivery into the skin rather than by protocol, so no mitigation steps were considered necessary. Across user groups, average scores were consistently high for the pre-defined key attributes. Overall acceptability scores (7-point scale) were significantly higher for the abatacept versus competitor autoinjectors-formative study: patients 6.7 vs 5.2 (P = 0.0001), caregivers 7.0 vs 4.6 (P = 0.0093), HCPs 6.8 vs 5.1 (P = 0.0020); summative study: patients 6.5 vs 5.9 (P = 0.0404), caregivers 6.8 vs 5.8 (P = 0.0047), HCPs 6.8 vs 5.1 (P = 0.0002). The abatacept autoinjector was preferred to competitor devices: patients 85.7% vs 14.3% (P = 0.00002), caregivers 84.2% vs 15.8% (P = 0.00443), HCPs 95.0% vs 5.0% (P = 0.00004). Positive experiences with the abatacept autoinjector were attributed to the rubberized grip, device size, visualization of dose progression, button ergonomics, and ease of use. CONCLUSION: The abatacept autoinjector demonstrated usability without patterns of preventable use errors, and with high acceptability ratings across all key attributes assessed. Preference over competitor autoinjectors was due to device ergonomics, visualization of dose progression, confidence of dose delivery, and overall ease of use. FUNDING: Bristol-Myers Squibb.",

The histological findings of a cutaneous lesion were consistent with drug-induced vasculitis. The clinical and histological findings, including the temporal relationship between MTX intake and the onset of vasculitis, and the results of withdrawal and rechallenge tests, suggest a causal relationship, and indicate a drug-induced LCV due to MTX.

        "Abstract":"Tumor necrosis factor alpha (TNF-alpha) is a key soluble mediator involved in the inflammatory cascade of many disorders including uveitis. Among the anti-TNF-alpha agents, one of the most used in immune-mediated diseases, such as inflammatory arthropathies, is adalimumab (Humira TM, Abbott Pharmaceutical Inc.), a fully humanized antibody. The purpose of this review is to analyze the main pharmacological and clinical aspects of adalimumab and its efficacy both in systemic and ocular inflammatory disorders. Adalimumab was effective in treating several autoimmune diseases, such as rheumatoid arthritis, ankylosing spondylitis, and psoriatic arthritis. In recent years, adalimumab has been used successfully in refractory cases of intraocular inflammation. Moreover, this biological agent showed good safety and efficacy profiles in ocular use including childhood uveitis. Switching from other anti-TNF-alpha agents to adalimumab may offer several advantages, such as easier administration, better patient compliance, and lower rate of adverse events. Adalimumab is a promising drug for the therapy of uveitis, although further studies are needed on its application in uveitis.",

        "Abstract":"BACKGROUND: Rheumatoid arthritis (RA) is associated with increased cardiovascular morbidity and mortality. In the current prospective study, we addressed the impact of RA on left atrial (LA) function and electrical remodelling. Further, we tried to demonstrate the effects of infliximab, an anti-TNF-alpha agent, on echocardiographical LA abnormality in RA patients with preserved left ventricular (LV) ejection fraction. METHODS: We compared 38 female RA patients without clinical evidence of heart disease and 30 female controls without RA and clinical evidence of heart disease. Further, we compared RA patients receiving infliximab and increasing doses of prednisolone over a three-month period. At baseline and post treatment, this study assessed (1) LA and LV parameters using conventional and speckle tracking echocardiography (STE), and (2) electrocardiographic P-wave changes. RESULTS: The values of C-reactive protein (CRP), isovolumic relaxation time (IVRT), A wave, and deceleration time (DT) were significantly higher in RA patients compared to the control group (p < 0.05), whereas E\/E' and E\/A values were found to be lower (p < 0.05) in RA patients. E\/E' values were lower in prednisolone- compared to infliximab-treated patients (p < 0.05). After three months of infliximab and prednisolone treatment, CRP and disease activity score (DAS 28) values decreased in both groups (p < 0.05), and Duke activity status index (DASI) increased (p < 0.05). Maximal left atrial volume index (LAVImax), pre-contraction left atrial volume index (LAVIpreA) and maximum P wave (Pmax) of the RA patients were higher compared to the control group (p < 0.05), whereas LA global strain was found to be lower (p < 0.05). There was no difference in Pmax values between groups before and after the treatment period. E\/E', LAVImax and LAVIpreA values of infliximab-treated patients decreased and LA global strain increased after three months of therapy compared to baseline (p < 0.05). At baseline in both treatment groups, E\/E' and LA global late diastolic strain rate were lower in prednisolone-compared to infliximab-treated patients (p < 0.05). CONCLUSION: There was echocardiographic LA abnormality in these RA patients. In this patient group there was also a meaningful increase in maximum P wave assessed by electrocardiography. Infliximab therapy for a period of three months improved LA abnormality.",

        "Published":"2001 Feb",
        "Abstract":"Rheumatoid arthritis (RA) is a systemic inflammatory disease. Along with synovial joint inflammation, extra-articular involvement is a common feature of RA. Periarticular and generalized osteoporosis are seen both as an extra-articular feature of the disease itself and due to various medications like glucocorticoids and methotrexate (MTX). In this study, we investigated the effects of oral alendronate in RA patients treated with MTX and prednisolone by comparing the effects of \"alendronate+calcium\" and \"only calcium\" on bone mineral density (BMD). Fifty RA patients classified according to American Rheumatism Association (ARA) criteria were included in the study. The control group consisted of 20 postmenopausal osteoporotic patients. The RA patients were divided randomly into two groups. All patients were started on MTX 7.5 mg\/week, 2.5-mg daily folic acid, and 7.5-mg daily prednisolone. The first group, consisting of 25 female RA patients, was also given 10-mg daily alendronate and 1000-mg daily calcium. The second group also consisted of 25 female patients and was given only 1000-mg calcium per day. The postmenopausal control group was given daily 10-mg alendronate and 1000-mg calcium. Bone mineral densities were measured by dual-energy x-ray absorptiometry (DEXA) and again at the end of the sixth month. At the end of the study, RA patients given only calcium had reduced mean BMD, and patients treated with alendronate and calcium showed increased mean BMD almost in all regions. This increase was significant in the L2 and L1-4 total regions. In postmenopausal osteoporotic patients, we saw statistically significant increases in BMD in all regions. The increase in BMD values in RA patients treated with alendronate was smaller than in those of the control group of postmenopausal osteoporosis patients. In conclusion, RA itself has a risk factor for osteoporosis in addition to the risks of the medications like corticosteroids and MTX. In the prevention and treatment of RA-associated osteoporosis, alendronate and calcium therapy is effective and well tolerated.",

        "Abstract":"OBJECTIVE: To establish the safety and efficacy of repeat infusions of tocilizumab (previously known as MRA), a humanized anti-interleukin-6 (IL-6) receptor antibody, alone and in combination with methotrexate (MTX), for the treatment of rheumatoid arthritis (RA). METHODS: The study group comprised 359 patients with active RA in whom the response to MTX was inadequate. During a stabilization period, these patients received their current dose of MTX for at least 4 weeks. Following stabilization, they were randomized to 1 of 7 treatment arms, as follows: tocilizumab at doses of 2 mg\/kg, 4 mg\/kg, or 8 mg\/kg either as monotherapy or in combination with MTX, or MTX plus placebo. RESULTS: A 20% response (improvement) according to the American College of Rheumatology criteria (ACR20 response) was achieved by 61% and 63% of patients receiving 4 mg\/kg and 8 mg\/kg of tocilizumab as monotherapy, respectively, and by 63% and 74% of patients receiving those doses of tocilizumab plus MTX, respectively, compared with 41% of patients receiving placebo plus MTX. Statistically significant ACR50 and ACR70 responses were observed in patients receiving combination therapy with either 4 mg\/kg or 8 mg\/kg of tocilizumab plus MTX (P < 0.05). A dose-related reduction in the Disease Activity Score in 28 joints was observed from week 4 onward, in all patients except those receiving monotherapy with 2 mg\/kg of tocilizumab. In the majority of patients who received 8 mg\/kg of tocilizumab, the C-reactive protein level\/erythrocyte sedimentation rate normalized, while placebo plus MTX had little effect on these laboratory parameters. Tocilizumab was mostly well tolerated, with a safety profile similar to that of other biologic and immunosuppressive therapies. Alanine transaminase and aspartate transaminase levels followed a sawtooth pattern (rising and falling between infusions). There were moderate but reversible increases in the nonfasting total cholesterol and triglyceride levels and reversible reductions in the high-density lipoprotein cholesterol and neutrophil levels. There were 2 cases of sepsis, both of which occurred in patients who were receiving combination therapy with 8 mg\/kg of tocilizumab plus MTX. CONCLUSION: These results indicate that targeted blockade of IL-6 signaling is a highly efficacious and promising means of decreasing disease activity in RA.",

        "Abstract":"Over the last decade, the use of tumor necrosis factor (TNF) inhibitors has improved the prognosis of patients with rheumatoid arthritis. Although these agents are more efficacious than traditional DMARDs, a substantial proportion of patients discontinue anti-TNF therapy because of adverse effects or lack of efficacy. Therapeutic options for these patients include dose increases, switching to an alternative TNF antagonist, or switching to a biologic of a different class, such as rituximab or abatacept. The recently published results of the RADIATE study by Emery et al. suggest that the interleukin-6 inhibitor tocilizumab is a safe and effective alternative for patients who fail to respond to anti-TNF therapy. Randomized controlled trials and the study of biomarkers are needed to help clinicians select the most suitable of these options for their patients.",

        "Abstract":"INTRODUCTION: Disease-modifying anti-rheumatic drugs (DMARDs) currently form the mainstay of treatment of rheumatoid arthritis (RA). We aimed to evaluate the retention rates of \"therapeutic segments\" of DMARDs in patients with RA. METHODS: This was a cross-sectional study of RA patients with at least one year of follow-up. A therapeutic segment is said to begin when one DMARD combination is instituted and it ends with a subsequent change. The disability index for each patient was calculated using a modified health assessment questionnaire. Retention rates were calculated using the Kaplan Meier survival analysis. RESULTS: 375 DMARD courses in 102 patients were analysed. 99 courses were being continued at the time of the study and hence were censored for the purposes of analysis. The respective median (interquartile range [IQR]) retention period for segments containing methotrexate (MTX), sulfasalazine, hydroxychloroquine and leflunomide was 28 (15-45), 12 (3-20), 18 (9-24), 15 (4-32) months. The log-rank statistical test indicated that MTX was retained longer singly (median [IQR] 43 [32-70] months) than in combination (median [IQR] 19 [10-24] months) (p-value is 0.001). The commonest reason for the discontinuation of the DMARD segment was the disease \"slipping out\" of control (51.1 percent) followed by adverse effects (24.3 percent). Treatment termination on account of disease control was encountered in 16.3 percent of courses only. As many as 63 percent of single DMARD segments were changed because of disease \"slip out\" as compared to 41 percent of combination DMARD segments. Adverse effects were a more frequent cause of termination of the combination segments (32 vs. 15 percent). CONCLUSION: MTX, used singly, had the highest retention rates among all the DMARDs used in RA patients. Disease \"slip out\" and adverse effects frequently required a change of the therapeutic segment.",

        "Abstract":"OBJECTIVES: To analyse the effect of a dose increase in patients with severe rheumatoid arthritis (RA) with insufficient clinical response to 3 mg\/kg infliximab every 8 weeks. METHODS: Patients suffering from active refractory RA despite methotrexate, were treated with i.v. infusions of infliximab (3 mg\/kg) on week 0, 2, 6 and every 8 weeks thereafter. Based on the clinical judgement at week 22, patients received a dose increase of 100 mg from week 30 on. The American College of Rheumatology (ACR) core set for disease activity measures was regularly assessed. RESULTS: Five hundred and eleven RA patients were included. At week 22, 61.4, 34 and 14.1% of all patients met ACR 20, ACR 50 and ACR 70 criteria, respectively, and 6.1% of patients were in remission. A low swollen joint count at baseline was correlated with improvement at week 22 for ACR 20 (P < 0.06), ACR 50 (P < 0.06) and ACR 70 (P < 0.005). The change in HAQ score between weeks 0 and 22 was predictive for response at week 54 (P < 0.01). The dose of infliximab was increased by 100 mg in 22% of the patients. Most baseline values of patients requiring dose increase were higher (P < or = 0.001) than the baseline values of the remaining patients. Increasing the dose of infliximab by one vial from week 30 on could circumvent the partial loss of response in these patients. CONCLUSION: Infliximab use in this large out-patient cohort resulted in a significant clinical improvement. A subgroup that partially lost response during the first 22 weeks could regain response by adding 100 mg of infliximab to the subsequent doses. Due to the current study design, however, a regression to the mean like effect could not be ruled out.",

        "Abstract":"OBJECTIVE: To evaluate the changes in anti-cyclic citrullinated peptide antibodies (anti-CCP) and rheumatoid factor (RF) following etanercept treatment in patients with rheumatoid arthritis. METHODS: The study included 90 patients with rheumatoid arthritis who failed treatment with disease modifying antirheumatic drugs (DMARDs). All patients were allowed to continue treatment with DMARDs; 52 of them received etanercept as a twice weekly 25 mg subcutaneous injection for three months, and the others did not. Serum samples were collected at baseline and one month intervals during the treatment course. The serum levels of anti-CCP and RF were tested by enzyme linked immunosorbent assay and nephelometry, respectively. RESULTS: At baseline, 45 of the 52 etanercept treated patients (86.5%) and 32 of the 38 controls (84.2%) were positive for anti-CCP. Tests for RF were positive in 78.9% and 84.2% of patients with or without etanercept treatment, respectively. The serum levels of anti-CCP and RF decreased significantly after a three month etanercept treatment (p = 0.007 and p = 0.006, respectively). The average decrease from baseline calculated for each individual patient in the etanercept treated group was 31.3% for anti-CCP and 36% for RF. The variation in anti-CCP was positively correlated with the variation in disease activity, swollen and tender joint counts, RF, and C reactive protein. CONCLUSIONS: Etanercept combined with DMARDs leads to a much greater decrease than DMARDs alone in the serum levels of anti-CCP and RF in rheumatoid arthritis, compatible with a reduction in clinical disease activity.",

        "Abstract":"The use of B-cell targeted therapies for the treatment of systemic lupus erythematosus (SLE) has generated great interest owing to the multiple pathogenic roles carried out by B cells in this disease. Strong support for targeting B cells is provided by genetic, immunological and clinical observations that place these cells at the center of SLE pathogenesis, as initiating, amplifying and effector cells. Interest in targeting B cells has also been fostered by the successful use of similar interventions to treat other autoimmune diseases such as rheumatoid arthritis, and by the initial promise shown by B-cell depletion to treat SLE in early studies. Although the initial high enthusiasm has been tempered by negative results from phase III trials of the B-cell-depleting agent rituximab in SLE, renewed vigor should be instilled in the field by the convergence of the latest results using agents that inhibit B-cell-activating factor (BAFF, also known as BLyS and tumor necrosis factor ligand superfamily, member 13b), further analysis of data from trials using rituximab and greatly improved understanding of B-cell biology. Combined, the available information identifies several new avenues for the therapeutic targeting of B cells in SLE. [References: 106]",

        "Abstract":"OBJECTIVE: To investigate the accumulation of methotrexate (MTX) in circulating erythrocytes and the association with pharmacokinetic variables, weekly dose, and clinical efficacy in 2 cohorts of patients with chronic active rheumatoid arthritis (RA) undergoing MTX monotherapy. METHODS: Seventy-six patients with RA were included in this open prospective study: 40 were included before initiation of MTX therapy. Laboratory analyses, intracellular MTX concentrations in erythrocytes (Ery-MTX), and clinical examinations including toxicity data were performed prospectively for 52 weeks. Plasma concentrations of MTX were measured and area under the plasma concentration versus time curve (AUC) was estimated along with other pharmacokinetic variables in a population based software model. RESULTS: Ery-MTX rose after initiation of therapy and reached a steady state after 6-8 weeks. The correlation between steady-state Ery-MTX and dose was poor (r(2) = 0.16), whereas steady-state Ery-MTX levels correlated strongly with the estimated AUC (r(2) = 0.51, log-transformed variables). Both steady-state Ery-MTX levels and estimated AUC were significantly higher in patients responding to MTX therapy than in patients classified as nonresponders according to American College of Rheumatology core criteria and were similar to patients on longterm MTX therapy. CONCLUSION: Our results indicate that clinical efficacy and Ery-MTX may have a causal relation and that measurement of Ery-MTX or estimation of AUC in a software model provides useful guidelines to the clinician when starting MTX therapy in patients with RA. The latter can be performed immediately after initiation of therapy.",

        "Abstract":"We report observations of a 47-year-old seropositive woman with rheumatoid arthritis (RA) suffering from mesangial immunoglobulin (Ig)A glomerulonephritis (GN) after initiation of abatacept, a selective T-cell co-stimulation modulator cytotoxic T-lymphocyte antigen 4 (CTLA4)-Ig. She was initially treated by corticosteroids, followed by methotrexate associated with a TNF inhibitor (adalimumab then switched to etanercept), finally switched to abatacept monotherapy, after secondary failure of these two forms of TNF inhibitors. Due to a progressively increased hematuria and proteinuria after abatacept therapy initiation, a renal biopsy was performed highlighting GN with mesangial IgA deposits, with necrosis and extracapillary crescent formations. IgA GN as a possible adverse event to abatacept was considered. Abatacept was stopped and a treatment by corticosteroids was initiated. Proteinuria decreased a couple of months after abatacept interruption. The short term between abatacept induction and IgA GN onset, as well as GN improvement since abatacept discontinuation, lend weight to the argument that CTLA4-Ig may play a crucial role in IgA GN pathogenesis. The possibility of a drug postponed adverse event justifies a long-term renal surveillance in RA patients treated by abatacept. Copyright © 2013 Societe francaise de rhumatologie.

Recent evidence based on spontaneous reporting shows an association with active tuberculosis (TB). We undertook this study to determine and describe the long-term safety of 2 of these agents, infliximab and etanercept, in rheumatic diseases based on a national active-surveillance system following the commercialization of the drugs. METHODS: We analyzed the safety data actively collected in the BIOBADASER (Base de Datos de Productos Biologicos de la Sociedad Espanola de Reumatologia) database, which was launched in February 2000 by the Spanish Society of Rheumatology. For the estimation of TB risk, the annual incidence rate in patients treated with these agents was compared with the background rate and with the rate in a cohort of patients with rheumatoid arthritis (RA) assembled before the era of anti-TNF treatment. RESULTS: Seventy-one participating centers sent data on 1,578 treatments with infliximab (86%) or etanercept (14%) in 1,540 patients. Drug survival rates (reported as the cumulative percentage of patients still receiving medication) for infliximab and etanercept pooled together were 85% and 81% at 1 year and 2 years, respectively. Instances of discontinuation were essentially due to adverse events. Seventeen cases of TB were found in patients treated with infliximab. The estimated incidence of TB associated with infliximab in RA patients was 1,893 per 100,000 in the year 2000 and 1,113 per 100,000 in the year 2001. These findings represent a significant increased risk compared with background rates. In the first 5 months of 2002, after official guidelines were established for TB prevention in patients treated with biologics, only 1 new TB case was registered (in January). CONCLUSION: Therapy with infliximab is associated with an increased risk of active TB. Proper measures are needed to prevent and manage this adverse event.",

        "Abstract":"OBJECTIVE: To determine the efficacy and safety of etanercept and etanercept plus sulfasalazine versus sulfasalazine in patients with rheumatoid arthritis (RA) despite sulfasalazine therapy. METHODS: Patients were randomly assigned to etanercept (25 mg twice weekly; sulfasalazine was discontinued at baseline), etanercept plus sulfasalazine (unchanged regimen of 2-3 g\/day) or sulfasalazine in a double-blind, randomised, 2-year study in adult patients with active RA despite sulfasalazine therapy. Efficacy was assessed using the American College of Rheumatology criteria, disease activity scores (DAS) and patient-reported outcomes (PRO). RESULTS: Demographic variables and baseline disease characteristics were comparable among treatment groups; mean DAS 5.1, 5.2 and 5.1 for etanercept (n = 103), etanercept plus sulfasalazine (n = 101) and sulfasalazine (n = 50), respectively. Withdrawal due to lack of efficacy was highest with sulfasalazine (26 (52%) vs 6 (6%) for either etanercept group, p<0.001). Patients receiving etanercept or etanercept plus sulfasalazine had a more rapid initial response, which was sustained at 2 years, than those receiving sulfasalazine: mean DAS 2.8, 2.5 versus 4.5, respectively (p<0.05); ACR 20 response was achieved by 67%, 77% versus 34% of patients, respectively (p<0.01) Overall, PRO followed a similar pattern; a clinically significant improvement in health assessment questionnaire was achieved by 76%, 78% versus 40% of patients, respectively (p<0.01). Commonly reported adverse events occurring in the etanercept groups were injection site reactions and pharyngitis\/laryngitis (p<0.01). CONCLUSION: Etanercept and etanercept plus sulfasalazine are efficacious for the long-term management of patients with RA. The addition of etanercept or substitution with etanercept should be considered as treatment options for patients not adequately responding to sulfasalazine.",

        "Abstract":"AIMS: Hydroxychloroquine (HCQ) is used widely in the treatment of chronic inflammatory diseases such as rheumatoid arthritis. Since there is great interindividual variability in the pharmacokinetics of HCQ and chloroquine is a potent inhibitor of CYP2D6-catalysed pathways in vitro, we wished to study the interaction of HCQ with CYP2D6-mediated metabolism of other drugs in vivo. METHODS: Metoprolol and dextromethorphan (DM) were selected as probe drugs because they are well-studied and widely used test substrates of CYP2D6. In this randomized, double-blind crossover study, seven healthy volunteers with extensive metabolizer phenotype for CYP2D6 ingested either 400 mg hydroxychloroquine or placebo daily for 8 days after which single oral dose pharmacokinetics of metoprolol were investigated. Dextromethorphan metabolic ratio (DM-MR) was also determined at baseline and after the ingestion of HCQ or placebo. RESULTS: Concomitant administration of HCQ increased the bioavailability of metoprolol, as indicated by significant increases in the area under the plasma concentration-time curve (65 +\/- 4.6%) and maximal plasma concentrations (72 +\/- 6.9%) of metoprolol. While the DM-MR values were not significantly changed, the phenotypic classification of one individual, who was heterozygous for a mutant CYP2D6 allele, was converted to a poor metabolizer by HCQ administration. CONCLUSIONS: HCQ inhibits metoprolol metabolism most probably by inhibiting its biotransformation by CYP2D6. The inhibitory effect of HCQ on dextromethorphan metabolism was not apparent when DM-MR was used as an indicator, except in an individual with limited CYP2D6 capacity.",

Before receiving biologic therapy, 97 RA patients were divided into two groups based on their chest computed tomography (CT) findings: the TB past infection group (n = 48), with old inflammatory changes due to prior pulmonary TB; and the non-TB infection group (n = 49), without such findings. The QFT-2G was not affected by methotrexate or prednisolone. Indeterminate results with a positive control had a low incidence (5.2%). A positive QFT-2G for the TB past infection group at cutoffs of 0.35 and 0.1 IU\/ml (intermediate range) was seen in 5.8% and 20.8%, respectively. A TST >20 mm was significantly higher in the non-TB infection group (31%) than in the TB past infection group (13%). The correlation between the QFT-2G and TST was poor among all patients. Disagreement between these tests in the non-TB infection group was caused by the false-positive TST induced by previous Bacillus Calmette-Guerin (BCG) vaccination. Only 12 (12.4%) of 97 patients had a positive QFT-2G (>=0.1 IU\/ml) and a negative TST (<20 mm), but in this subgroup, a high incidence (10, 83.3%) was detected in the TB past infection group. QFT-2G may be a good alternative to the TST to evaluate previous TB infection when it is necessary to determine whether isoniazid (INH) prophylaxis is needed before biologic therapy is begun.",

METHODS: Patients with active RA ((DAS28) >3.2) who were enrolled in the first open label phase of the RELIEF study received leflunomide for 24 weeks. Inadequate responders then entered the double blind phase and received a further 24 weeks' treatment with leflunomide (20 mg once daily) plus sulfasalazine (final dose 2 g once daily), or placebo plus sulfasalazine (dose as above). The primary efficacy variable was the DAS28 response rate, and secondary efficacy outcomes were ACR 20%, 50%, and 70% response rates.

        "Abstract":"BACKGROUND: Treatment with tumor necrosis factor inhibitors for rheumatoid arthritis has been associated with a decreased risk of cardiovascular disease in observational studies. There are conflicting data on the influence of tumor necrosis factor inhibitors on lipid levels. OBJECTIVES: To evaluate the effect of treatment with adalimumab on blood lipid levels, lipoproteins, and atherosclerosis of the carotid artery. METHODS: Fourteen patients with active rheumatoid arthritis (11 women and 3 men; mean age 63.7 years; median disease duration 9.0 years; and 78% rheumatoid factor positive) were treated with adalimumab 40 mg subcutaneously every 2 weeks and followed for 3 months. The patients had not been treated with adalimumab previously and had not received other tumor necrosis factor inhibitors within the past 3 months or moderate\/high dose corticosteroids within the past 2 weeks. The intima-media thickness of the common carotid artery was assessed using B mode ultrasonography. Triglycerides, total cholesterol, LDL cholesterol, and HDL cholesterol levels were analyzed in fresh fasting blood samples, whereas apolipoprotein B and apolipoprotein A1 (apoA1) levels were determined in thawed plasma samples using standard turbidimetric immunoassays. RESULTS: Total cholesterol (mean=5.36 vs 5.96 mmol\/L; P=0.005), LDL cholesterol (mean=3.33 vs 3.77 mmol\/L; P=.005), HDL cholesterol (mean=1.43 vs 1.55 mmol\/L; P=0.048), apolipoprotein B (mean=1.04 vs 1.13 g\/L; P=.012), and apoA1 (mean=1.42 vs 1.58 g\/L; P=0.005) all increased, but there were no major changes in the LDL to HDL cholesterol ratio (median=2.56 vs 2.35; P=0.27) or the apolipoprotein B to apoA1 ratio (mean=0.76 vs 0.74; P=0.46). There was no change in triglyceride levels (P=0.55). Disease activity decreased significantly from baseline to the 3-month evaluation (disease activity score based on 28 joints mean=5.6 vs 4.1; P=0.007). An increase in apoA1 correlated with decreases in the patient global assessment of disease severity (r=0.79; P=0.001) and C-reactive protein level (r=0.74; P=0.003). Changes in the apoliprotein B to apoA1 ratio correlated with changes in erythrocyte sedimentation rate (r=0.54; P=0.046). There was no major change in the common carotid artery intima-media thickness (mean=0.78 vs 0.80 mm; P=0.48). CONCLUSIONS: Although these results suggest that control of inflammation could have a beneficial effect on the lipid profile through an increase in HDL cholesterol levels, the observed protective effect on cardiovascular disease events by tumor necrosis factor blockers is likely to be explained by other mechanisms than changes in lipid levels or short-term effects on atherosclerosis of the carotid artery.",

        "Published":"2007 Feb",
        "Abstract":"BACKGROUND: Optimal use of disease-modifying antirheumatic drugs (DMARDs) in rheumatoid arthritis is vital if progression of disease is to be reduced. Methotrexate (MTX) and sulfasalazine (SASP) are widely used inexpensive DMARDs, recently often combined despite no firm evidence of benefit from previous studies. AIM: To establish whether a combination of SASP and MTX is superior to either drug alone in patients with rheumatoid arthritis with a suboptimal response to 6 months of SASP. METHODS: A randomised controlled study of step-up DMARD treatment in early rheumatoid arthritis. In phase I, 687 patients received SASP for 6 months. Those with a disease activity score (DAS) > or =2.4 were offered additional treatment in phase II (SASP alone, MTX alone or a combination of the two). The primary outcome measure was change in DAS. RESULTS: At 6 months, 191 (28%) patients had a DAS <2.4, 123 (18%) were eligible but did not wish to enter phase II, 130 (19%) stopped SASP because of reversible adverse events and 165 (24%) entered phase II. DAS at 18 months was significantly lower in those who received combination treatment compared with those who received either SASP or MTX: monotherapy arms did not differ. Improvement in European League Against Rheumatism and American College of Rheumatology 20, 50 and 70 scores favoured combination therapy. CONCLUSIONS: In this \"true-to-life\" study, an inexpensive combination of DMARDs proved more effective than monotherapy in patients with rheumatoid arthritis with a suboptimal response to SASP. There was no increase in toxicity. These results provide an evidence base for the use of this combination as a component of tight control strategies.",

        "Abstract":"BACKGROUND: Graft-versus-host disease (GVHD) is a rare, serious, fatal disease that occurs after orthotopic liver transplantation (OLT). CASE REPORT: We treated a 60-year-old man who underwent OLT owing to familial amyloidosis. The patient developed fever on postoperative day 16. The fever was persistent and did not respond to antibiotic therapy. Cultures and radiologic studies were done and excluded infection as a potential cause. On postoperative day 26, a skin rash appeared on his chest, accompanied by diarrhea and persistent fever. The rash spread all over the trunk, neck, and arms, but spared the palms of his hands and soles of his feet. In the meantime, his blood cell count revealed pancytopenia. Skin biopsy was done and showed interface lymphocytic infiltrate that are largely centered on the dermal-epidermal junction, is consistent with GVHD (this pattern of rash distribution is unique and different from the rash of GVHD after hematopoietic stem cell transplant, which is confined to palms of the hands and soles of the feet; Fig 1). The diagnosis was confirmed by colonoscopy and multiple forceps biopsies, which revealed extensive crypt loss. After hematology consultation, the patient was treated by withdrawal of all immunosuppressive therapy coupled with abatacept infusion. Abatacept is a chimeric protein that inhibits T-lymphocytes and is approved by the US Food and Drug Administration for the treatment of rheumatoid arthritis. Interestingly, after second dose of abatacept the patient showed marked clinical and laboratory improvement. The patient was discharged after 47 days in a stable condition. CONCLUSION: Because of the lack of a consensus for treatment of these patients, we report our experience with a male patient who had post-OLT GVHD and showed a marked improvement in response to abatacept.

        "Abstract":"OBJECTIVE: To determine that concomitant use of methotrexate (MTX) is required to achieve adequate suppression of bone destruction in treating rheumatoid arthritis (RA) with tumor necrosis factor-alpha (TNF-alpha)-inhibiting biologic therapy. We quantitatively compared the suppressive effects of treatment with a combination of infliximab and MTX and treatment with each of these 2 agents alone on bone destruction in SCID-HuRAg-pit mice. METHODS: Tissue derived from human RA pannus was implanted with a slice of dentin subcutaneously in the backs of SCID mice (SCID-HuRAg-pit model). Infliximab was administered daily to SCID-HuRAg-pit mice using an osmotic pump for 2 weeks with or without oral administration of MTX. Histological changes in tissue and the pits formed on the dentin slice were examined 8 weeks after transplant. Serum concentrations of TNF-alpha and interleukin 6 (IL-6) were also measured. RESULTS: Treatment with a combination of infliximab and MTX suppressed pit formation significantly, while treatment with neither infliximab alone nor MTX alone had a significant effect on pit formation. Synovial inflammation and serum TNF-alpha and IL-6 levels were suppressed by infliximab with or without MTX. CONCLUSION: This is the first evidence in an animal model of arthritis that concomitant use of MTX is required to achieve adequate suppression of bone destruction when treating RA with a TNF-alpha-inhibiting biologic. Our findings suggest that infliximab suppresses bone destruction through a mechanism of action different from that mediating its antiinflammatory effects in the treatment of RA.",

        "Published":"2012 Mar 12",
        "Abstract":"INTRODUCTION: B-cell depletion has become a common treatment strategy in anti-TNF-refractory rheumatoid arthritis (RA). Although the exact mechanism of how B-cell depletion leads to clinical amelioration in RA remains to be elucidated, repetitive treatment with B-cell-depleting agents leading to long-term B-cell depletion has been reported to be beneficial. The latter has led to the hypothesis that the beneficial effects of B-cell depletion might act through their influence on pathogenic autoreactive plasma cells. METHODS: In this study, we investigated the effects of a fixed retreatment regimen with anti-CD20 mAbs on the humoral (auto)immune system in a cohort of therapy-refractory RA patients. RESULTS: Fixed retreatment led to long-term B-cell depletion in peripheral blood, bone marrow and, to a lesser extent, synovium. Also, pathologic autoantibody secretion (that is, anticitrullinated peptide antibodies (ACPAs)) was more profoundly affected by long-term depletion than by physiological protective antibody secretion (that is, against measles, mumps and rubella). This was further illustrated by a significantly shorter estimated life span of ACPA-IgG secretion compared to total IgG secretion as well as protective antibody secretion. CONCLUSION: By studying plasma cell function during an extensive 2-year period of B-cell depletion, autoantibody secretion was significantly shorter-lived than physiologically protective antibody secretion. This suggests that the longevity of autoreactive plasma cells is different from protective long-lived plasma cells and might indicate a therapeutic window for therapies that target plasma cells.",

Patients with RA (n = 40, M\/F: 3\/37) who received aTNFs at least 6 months with good response (group I; n = 20) or discontinued at least one aTNFs because of the ineffectiveness and subsequently received RTX at least one course (group II; n = 20) were retrospectively evaluated. IgM-, IgA-, IgG-rheumatoid factor (RF) and anti-cyclic citrullinated peptide (anti-CCP) levels were measured by ELISA technique. Extraarticular manifestations and radiological scores were also recorded. The mean (SD) age was 51.7 +\/- 6.5 years in group I and 52.1 +\/- 6.1 years in group II patients (p > 0.05). The median disease durations were higher in group II than group I [8.0 (2-30) vs. 13 (3-35) years, respectively, p = 0.04]. Presence of RF [13(61.9 %) vs. 20(100 %) p = 0.001] and extraarticular involvement [5(25 %) vs. 13(65 %) p = 0.01] were higher in group II patients. When Ig-RF subgroups analyzed, all subgroup (IgA, IgM, IgG) levels were higher in group II (p = 0.001, p = 0.05, p = 0.001). IgA-RF levels were significantly high in patients with extraarticular involvement (p = 0.04). Association between high RF levels and having extraarticular manifestations in RA patients may largely be attributed to the IgA isotype.",

Hepatic histology was reported in 182 cases. All available microscopic liver slides from cases in which the autopsy report described portal tract inflammation, fibrosis, cirrhosis, tumour, amyloid, vasculitis, or infections involving the liver were examined and graded by a hepatic pathologist blinded to the original diagnosis, along with a representative sample of cases with reports describing fatty change or no hepatic pathologic abnormalities. Ninety normal and abnormal cases were reviewed from the 182 for which hepatic histology was available. Fifteen cases of diffuse fibrosis were identified upon blinded review. Two cases were graded as severe fibrosis (grades 3 or 4 on a scale of 0-4) without an identifiable pathologic cause, in both of which the liver disease was suspected premortem (alcohol abuse and viral hepatitis). Although the incidence of fibrosis in this series is slightly higher than that previously described, serious fibrotic liver disease was rare. These results support the current practice of limiting pre-treatment liver biopsies prior to methotrexate therapy to patients with suspected liver disease.",

        "Abstract":"It is still unknown whether there is an association between the use of certolizumab pegol (CZP) in rheumatic patients and the onset of cardiac arrhythmias. We describe the cases of two patients with rheumatoid arthritis (RA) treated with CZP as the first-line biological drug and methotrexate (MTX), who developed an arrhythmic event. The first was a 60-year-old, hypertensive male smoker, the second a 66-year-old dyslipidemic female non-smoker. Both were diagnosed as having RA in 2010, and started treatment with MTX plus CZP. The first patient developed undatable atrial fibrillation, which was resistant to pharmacological treatment and electrical cardioversion. The second patient developed an atrial flutter, which was treated with a betablocker. In both cases, we set a cautious interval between two consecutive administrations of CZP and, in the first case, also reduced the dose of MTX without any worsening of RA activity. Although many studies have shown that tumor necrosis factor (TNF)-alpha plays a pathogenetic role in inducing an arrhythmogenic substrate that is apparently rescued by anti-TNF drugs, there is still a lack of conclusive data. We suggest caution in any patient developing a cardiac event (including rhythm disorders) during treatment with a conventional or biological disease-modifying anti-rheumatic drug.",

        "Abstract":"This study aimed to compare the long-term safety of biologics by initiation year of treatment in patients with rheumatoid arthritis (RA) in Japan. RA patients who started their first biologics including infliximab, etanercept, adalimumab, and tocilizumab between 2003 and 2008 were identified in the Tsurumai Biologics Communication Registry (TBCR), multicenter observational cohort, and followed for 2 years or until discontinuation of the drugs. We identified baseline predictors for adverse events (AEs) resulting in discontinuation of the first TNFI using Cox proportional hazards regression analysis. A total of 874 cases (1,340 person-years) were observed. During the observation period, 96 AEs (4.7 events\/100 person-years) occurred. From 2003 to 2008, there were significant changes in disease duration, Steinbrocker stage, and disease activity in those aged <=64 years with no increase of incidence of AEs, whereas those aged >64 years had no significant changes in these variables. In the later initiation year of treatment with biologics, the fewer AEs were observed (log-rank, p = 0.017, 2008 vs. 2003-2005). Multivariate analysis showed that the initiation year significantly impacted the incidence of AEs 6 months into the observation period [initiation at 2008 (vs. 2003-2005): OR: 0.30, 95 % CI: (0.14-0.68)] after adjusting for variables at baseline. The decrease of AEs in the later initiation year was evident in those aged >64 years. The safety of biologic therapy improved over the course of the 8 years from its implementation in Japan.",

        "Abstract":"OBJECTIVE: To define the synovial characteristics of patients with rheumatoid arthritis (RA) and psoriatic arthritis (PsA) in clinical and ultrasound remission achieved by combination therapy with methotrexate (MTX) and tumour necrosis factor (TNF) blockers. METHODS: Patients with RA in remission (n=25) (disease activity score (DAS)<1.6 for at least 6 months), patients with RA in low disease activity (LDA) (n=10) (1.6<DAS<2.4 for at least 6 months) and patients with PsA in remission (n=18) (DAS<1.6 and Psoriasis Area Severity Index (PASI)=0 for at least 6 months) achieved by MTX+anti-TNF (adalimumab 40 mg or etanercept 50 mg) with power Doppler (PDUS)-negative synovial hypertrophy underwent synovial tissue biopsy. Patients with RA with high\/moderate disease naive to treatment (n=50) were included as a comparison group. Immunostaining for cluster designation (CD)68, CD21, CD20, CD3, CD31 and collagen was performed. RESULTS: PDUS-negative patients with RA in remission showed lower histological scores for synovial CD68+, CD20+, CD3+ cells and CD31+ vessels and collagen deposition (p<0.05 for both lining and sublining) compared with PDUS-positive patients with RA with high\/moderate disease. In addition, there was no significant difference in terms of lining and sublining CD68+, CD20+, CD3+, CD31+ cells and collagen comparing PDUS-negative patients with RA in remission and in LDA, respectively. On the contrary, PDUS-negative patients with PsA in remission showed higher histological scores for sublining CD68+ (p=0.02) and CD3+ cells (p=0.04) as well as CD31+ vessels (p<0.001) than PDUS-negative patients with RA in remission. CONCLUSIONS: PDUS-negative patients with RA in remission have comparable synovial histological features than PDUS-negative patients with RA in LDA. However, patients with PsA in remission are characterised by a higher degree of residual synovial inflammation than patients with RA in remission, despite PDUS negativity under TNF inhibition.

METHODS: In across-sectional study, 39 RA-ILD patients confirmed by high-resolution computed tomography (HRCT) were compared with 42 RA without lung involvement (RA only). Characteristics related to RA-ILD were assessed in all of the patients and serum anti-CCP2 titers quantified. RESULTS: Higher anti-CCP2 titers were found in RA-ILD compared with RA only (medians 77.9 versus 30.2 U\/mL, P < 0.001). In the logistic regression analysis after adjustment for age, disease duration (DD), smoke exposure, disease activity, functioning, erythrocyte sedimentation rate, and methotrexate (MTX) treatment duration, the characteristics associated with RA-ILD were higher anti-CCP2 titers (P = 0.003) and + RF (P = 0.002). In multivariate linear regression, the variables associated with severity of ground-glass score were anti-CCP2 titers (P = 0.02) and with fibrosis score DD (P = 0.01), anti-CCP2 titers (P < 0.001), and MTX treatment duration (P < 0.001). CONCLUSIONS: Anti-CCP2 antibodies are markers of severity and extent of RA-ILD in HRCT.

METHODS: A nested case-control study was conducted using data from Truven's MarketScan commercial and Medicare claims database for patients with early RA who started treatment with either a TNFi or a nonbiologic DMARD between January 1, 2008, and December 31, 2010. Date of CV event diagnosis for cases was defined as the event date, and 12 age-matched and sex-matched controls were sampled using incidence density sampling. Drug exposure was defined into the following mutually exclusive categories hierarchically: (1) current use of TNFi (with or without nonbiologics), (2) past use of TNFi (with or without nonbiologics), (3) current use of nonbiologics only, and (4) past use of nonbiologics only. Current use was defined as any use in the period 90 days prior to the event date. Conditional logistic regression models were used to derive incidence rate ratios (IRR). RESULTS: From the cohort of patients with early RA, 279 cases of incident CV events and 3348 matched controls were identified. The adjusted risk of CV events was not significantly different between current TNFi users and current nonbiologic users (IRR 0.92, 95% CI 0.59-1.44). However, past users of nonbiologics showed significantly higher risk compared to current nonbiologic users (IRR 1.47, 95% CI 1.04-2.08).

The clinical efficacy of tocilizumab (TCZ), a humanized anti-IL6-receptor mAb, confirmed the value of IL-6 blockade in this disease. A number of new anti-IL-6 biologics are currently in Phase I - III of clinical development for RA. AREAS COVERED: This article reviews the available results from Phase II trials of investigational anti-IL-6 agents in RA. The authors discuss the potential relevance of alternative IL-6-blocking agents, with regard to their specific molecular targets in IL-6 signaling pathways and to the main open questions in the clinical research agenda for anti-IL-6 biologics. EXPERT OPINION: The results of Phase II trials of new anti-IL-6 biologics show promising results in terms of efficacy. The most frequently reported adverse events were not unexpected based on previous experience with TCZ. Further evidence is needed to appraise whether the difference in molecular structure or in the specific target of new anti-IL-6 biologics might result in added therapeutic value over TCZ. New data from Phase III trials that provides a head-to-head comparison against TCZ and anti-TNF agents with or without methotrexate background treatment are expected in the future.",

Part 1 is reported here. METHODS: The CRA Therapeutics Committee assembled a national working group of RA clinical experts, researchers, patient consumers, and a general practitioner. Treatment questions were developed a priori based on results of a national needs assessment survey. A systematic review of all clinical practice guidelines and consensus statements regarding treatment with traditional and biologic DMARD in patients with RA published between January 2000 and June 2010 was performed in Medline, Embase, and CINAHL databases, and the grey literature. Guideline quality was assessed by 2 independent reviewers, and guideline characteristics, recommendations, and supporting evidence from observational studies and randomized controlled trials were synthesized into evidence tables. The full working group reviewed the evidence tables and developed recommendations using a modified Delphi technique. RESULTS: Five overarching principles and 26 recommendations addressing general RA management strategies and treatment with glucocorticoids and traditional and biologic DMARD were developed for rheumatologists, other primary prescribers of RA drug therapies, and patients with RA. CONCLUSION: These recommendations were developed based on a synthesis of international guidelines, supporting evidence, and expert consensus considering the Canadian healthcare context with the intention of promoting best practices and improving healthcare delivery for persons with RA.",

        "Abstract":"OBJECTIVE: Sulfasalazine (SSZ) is an anti-rheumatic drug that has been used to treat chronic arthritis. In many reports, the use of SSZ in children with systemic onset juvenile rheumatoid arthritis (JRA) revealed frequent side effects which required discontinuation of the drug. We examined whether there were frequent side effects of SSZ in patients with adult-onset Still's Disease (AOSD). METHODS: From July 1990 to April 1998, we followed 41 AOSD patients. Ten were given SSZ for the treatment of arthritis and the side effects were studied. We also studied 109 consecutive patients with RA who had been given SSZ, as a control group. In addition, we retrospectively studied the side effects and efficacy of SSZ in both groups through their medical records. RESULTS: Six patients (60%, p < 0.01) with AOSD experienced side effects ranging from mild ones like abdominal pain, nausea and vomiting, urticaria, and facial flushing to severe ones such as high fever, hypotension, and severe myelosuppression as well as fulminant hepatitis, which led to the death of one patient. However, 16 patients (14.7%) with RA stopped using SSZ due to mild side effects such as rash, urticaria, gastrointestinal troubles, mild leukopenia, and fever. Three AOSD patients (30%, p = 0.053) and 15 RA patients (13.8%) stopped using SSZ due to its inefficacy. CONCLUSION: We conclude that SSZ appears to have frequent severe side effects in AOSD, as in systemic onset JRA. These potential adverse effects of SSZ should be considered when it is used to treat chronic arthritides with systemic symptoms. Further study of SSZ in the treatment of AOSD in a multi-center, placebo-controlled environment is needed.",

At six months, tacrolimus was continued at 1-2 mg\/day in 27 of 32 patients, but was discontinued in five cases who showed no or inadequate response. Of the 32 patients, 47% were evaluated as having a moderate or good response at one month of tacrolimus therapy, and 72% at six months. No serious adverse events were observed.

METHODS: This multicenter, prospective, observational, postmarketing surveillance study was conducted between February 2013 and April 2015 at 84 centers in Japan. Patients with RA at risk of progressive structural joint damage were enrolled and initiated treatment with adalimumab and MTX. Adverse events were recorded up to week 28. Effectiveness\/disease activity was assessed using the Disease Activity Score based on a 28-joint count with erythrocyte sedimentation rate and C-reactive protein (DAS28-4ESR and DAS28-4CRP), Clinical Disease Activity Index, and Simplified Disease Activity Index at 0, 4, 12, and 24 weeks. DAS28-4CRP response was evaluated in the low-dose (<8 mg\/week) and high-dose (>=8 mg to <=16 mg\/week) MTX groups at week 24. RESULTS: One hundred fifty-seven of 163 patients comprised the safety cohort: mean (SD) age, 56.5 (13.9) years; females, 65.6%; rheumatoid factor positive, 73.2%; anti-cyclic citrullinated peptide antibody positive, 66.9%; bone erosions, 51.6%; mean disease duration, 9.5 months. The majority of patients (>=80%) had moderate or high disease activity at baseline, and >=50% with available data achieved remission or low disease activity at week 24 (DAS28-4CRP <3.2). Five serious adverse drug reactions occurred in four patients, including pyelonephritis, Pneumocystis jiroveci pneumonia, interstitial lung disease, pleurisy, and pericarditis; the outcomes were either recovered or recovering. Significant improvements\/reductions in disease activity over 24 weeks were noted in all effectiveness measures (P < 0.0001). Most of the population achieved DAS28-4CRP remission (<2.6) at week 24 regardless of the MTX dose. CONCLUSION: Adalimumab in combination with MTX could be a beneficial treatment option for DMARD- and biologic-naive Japanese patients with RA at risk of progressive structural joint damage.

        "Published":"2017 03",
        "Abstract":"Neutrophils are implicated in the pathology of rheumatoid arthritis (RA), but the mechanisms regulating their activation are largely unknown. RA is a heterogeneous disease, and whereas many patients show clinical improvement during TNF inhibitor (TNFi) therapy, a significant proportion fails to respond. In vitro activation of neutrophils with agents, including TNF, results in rapid and selective changes in gene expression, but how neutrophils contribute to TNF signaling in RA and whether TNFi sensitivity involves differential neutrophil responses are unknown. With the use of RNA sequencing (RNA-Seq), we analyzed blood neutrophils from 20 RA patients, pre-TNFi therapy, to identify biomarkers of response, measured by a decrease in disease activity score based on 28 joint count (DAS28), 12 wk post-therapy. Biomarkers were validated by quantitative PCR (qPCR) of blood neutrophils from 2 further independent cohorts of RA patients: 16 pre-TNFi and 16 predisease-modifying anti-rheumatic drugs (DMARDs). Twenty-three neutrophil transcripts predicted a 12-wk response to TNFi: 10 (IFN-regulated) genes predicting a European League against Rheumatism (EULAR) good response and 13 different genes [neutrophil granule protein (NGP) genes] predicting a nonresponse. Statistical analysis indicated a predictive sensitivity and specificity of each gene in the panel of >80%, with some 100% specific. A combination of 3 genes [cytidine monophosphate kinase 2 (CMPK2), IFN-induced protein with tetratricopeptide repeats 1B (IFIT1B), and RNASE3] had the greatest predictive power [area under the curve (AUC) 0.94]. No correlation was found for a response to DMARDs. We conclude that this panel of genes is selective for predicting a response to TNFi and is not a surrogate marker for disease improvement. We also show that in RA, there is great plasticity in neutrophil phenotype, with circulating cells expressing genes normally only expressed in more immature cells.

        "Published":"2016 Dec",
        "Abstract":"PURPOSE: Tofacitinib is an oral Janus kinase inhibitor for the treatment of rheumatoid arthritis (RA). This analysis compared the efficacy and safety of tofacitinib with biologic disease-modifying antirheumatic drugs in patients with RA and a prior inadequate response (IR) to tumor necrosis factor inhibitors (TNFi). METHODS: A systematic literature review identified 5 randomized placebo-controlled trials that evaluated tofacitinib or biologic disease-modifying antirheumatic drugs (bDMARDs) against placebo in patient populations with RA with a prior IR to TNFi. The definition of TNFi-IR varied across studies, and included patients with an IR or who had failed treatment with TNFi for any reason. A network meta-analysis was conducted comparing study data with regard to American College of Rheumatology response rates and Health Assessment Questionnaire-Disability Index improvement at weeks 12 and 24, rates of treatment withdrawal due to all causes; adverse events (AEs) and lack of efficacy; and rates of AEs, serious AEs, and serious infections. FINDINGS: The 5 trials included a total of 2136 patients. Tofacitinib 5 mg twice daily combined with methotrexate was found to have relative risk estimates of American College of Rheumatology responses and change from baseline in Health Assessment Questionnaire-Disability Index score comparable with abatacept, golimumab, rituximab, and tocilizumab combined with conventional synthetic disease-modifying antirheumatic drugs. Withdrawal rates from trials due to all causes and AEs were comparable between treatments, and tofacitinib had a lower rate of withdrawals due to lack of efficacy. Rates of AEs and HAQ-DI were comparable between tofacitinib, other active treatments, and placebo. No serious infections were reported with tofacitinib during the placebo-controlled period (up to week 12) in this study population; rates of serious infection with other active treatments were generally low and similar to placebo. IMPLICATIONS: During a 24-week period, tofacitinib had efficacy and rates of AEs comparable with currently available bDMARDs in the treatment of patients with RA who had a prior IR to TNFi.

        "Published":"2016 Oct",
        "Abstract":"OBJECTIVES: The aim of this study was to compare three measurement methods for non-adherence to DMARDs in early arthritis patients: the Compliance Questionnaire Rheumatology (CQR), the intracellular uptake of MTX in the form of MTX-polyglutamates (MTX-PGs) and electronic measurement with Medication Event Monitoring Systems (MEMS). METHODS: DMARD naive early arthritis patients were included in an ongoing cohort study. MEMS were used to measure adherence continuously, while every 3 months MTX-PGs were collected together with the CQR. The associations between the measures were estimated with Spearman rank correlations. Sensitivity and specificity of the CQR against a MEMS cut-off was compared at 3, 6, 9 and 12 months. The same applied to MTX-PGs against a MEMS cut-off and MTX-PGs against a CQR cut-off. For the association between MEMS, the CQR and MTX-PGs, a multilevel linear regression model was performed with age, gender, weeks of treatment and MTX dosage as covariates. RESULTS: We included 206 patients. Non-adherence measured with MEMS varied over time and between DMARDs. The CQR score was not associated with MEMS non-adherence at 3, 9 and 12 months. At 9 months, MTX-PGs was associated with MEMS non-adherence, as well as with the CQR. All correlations were below 0.30. CONCLUSION: Associations between the three measures are weak. Explanations are individual differences in the uptake of MTX, and little variance in adherence between patients. Moreover, the measurement domains differ: perceptions (CQR), behaviour (MEMS) and pharmacokinetics (MTX). Copyright © The Author 2016.

These individuals were receiving weekly intramuscular methotrexate (MTX) but were about to discontinue because of side effects. While there was considerable improvement in nausea during the study, the effect of folinic acid could not be differentiated from that of placebo. There was no adverse effect on control of disease activity. It therefore seems likely that polyglutamated tissue stores of MTX do not contribute to drug efficacy and in this format folinic acid could not be shown to be more useful than placebo in reducing drug induced nausea.",

        "Published":"2016 Nov",
        "Abstract":"OBJECTIVE: To compare the efficacy and safety between tocilizumab added to methotrexate and tocilizumab switched from methotrexate in patients with active rheumatoid arthritis (RA). METHODS: This is a 2-year randomised, controlled study. RA patients with moderate or high disease activity despite methotrexate were randomly assigned either to tocilizumab added to methotrexate (add-on) or tocilizumab switched from methotrexate (switch). The primary endpoint was the DAS28 remission rate at week 24. Secondary objectives included other clinical efficacy indices, radiological outcomes assessed with the van der Heijde-modified total Sharp scoring system (mTSS), and safety. RESULTS: Of 223 randomised patients, 83% completed 52 weeks. DAS28 remission rates at week 24 were 70% for add-on and 55% for switch (p=0.02), but they became comparable at week 52 (72% vs 70%, p=0.86). Structural remission rates (mTSS<=0.5) at week 52 were not different (66% vs 64%, p=0.92). However, clinically relevant radiographic progression rates (CRRP; mTSS>=3) tended to be higher with the switch than with the add-on (15% vs 7%, p=0.07). Radiographic progression in the CRRP patients was larger with the switch than with the add-on (9.0\/year vs 5.0\/year, p=0.04). The difference in the mean C-reactive protein of the CRRP patients was significant for the first 24 weeks (1.56 vs 0.49, p=0.001) but not for the following 28 weeks (0.10 vs 0.04, p=0.1). Overall safety was preferable in the switch group. CONCLUSIONS: In RA patients with inadequate response to methotrexate, tocilizumab added to methotrexate more rapidly suppressed inflammation than tocilizumab switched from methotrexate, leading to superior clinical efficacy and prevention of joint destruction.

        "Published":"2017 08 11",
        "Abstract":"BACKGROUND: Currently, although several categories of biological disease-modifying antirheumatic drugs (bDMARDs) are available, there are few data informing selection of initial treatment for individual patients with rheumatoid arthritis (RA). Therefore, tumor necrosis factor inhibitor (TNF-i) and tocilizumab (TCZ) are treated as equivalent treatments in the recent disease management recommendations. We focused on two anticytokine therapies, TCZ and TNF-i, and aimed to develop a scoring system that predicts a better treatment for each RA patient before starting an IL-6 or a TNF-i. METHODS: The expression of IL-6 and TNF-alpha mRNA in peripheral blood from 45 newly diagnosed RA patients was measured by DNA microarrays to evaluate cytokine activation. Next, laboratory indices immediately before commencing treatment and disease activity score improvement ratio after 6 months in 98 patients treated with TCZ or TNF-i were retrospectively analyzed. Some indices correlated with TCZ efficacy were selected and their cutoff values were defined by receiver operating characteristic (ROC) analysis to develop a scoring system to discriminate between individuals more likely to respond to TCZ or TNF-i. The validity of the scoring system was verified in these 98 patients and an additional 228 patients. RESULTS: There was significant inverse correlation between the expression of IL-6 and TNF-alpha mRNA in newly diagnosed RA patients. The analysis of 98 patients revealed significant correlation between TCZ efficacy and platelet counts, hemoglobin, aspartate aminotransferase, and alanine aminotransferase; in contrast, there was no similar correlation in the TNF-i group. The cutoff values were defined by ROC analysis to develop a scoring system (1 point\/item, maximum of 4 points). A good TCZ response was predicted if the score was >=2; in contrast, TNF-i seemed to be preferable if the score was <=1. Similar results were obtained in a validation study of an additional 228 patients. If the case scored >=3, the good responder rates of TCZ\/TNF-i were 75.0%\/37.9% (p < 0.01) and the non-responder rates were 3.1%\/27.6% (p < 0.01), respectively. CONCLUSIONS: The score is easily calculated from common laboratory results. It appears useful for identifying a better treatment at the time of selecting either an IL-6 or a TNF inhibitor.",

METHODS: The Stockholm TNF follow-up registry (STURE) was used. Treatment results at 6 months were analysed by (i) the biologic used, (ii) the type of anti-TNF switch, and (iii) the reason for discontinuation (inefficacy or intolerance). RESULTS: A total of 328 patients who failed an anti-TNF switched to an alternative biologic, 69 to RTX, 161 to an anti-TNF monoclonal antibody (mAb), and 98 to etanercept (ETA). Significant reductions in the 28-joint Disease Activity Score (DAS28) at 6 months were observed for all groups. The mean +\/- SD reduction in DAS28 was 1.70 +\/- 1.18 for RTX, 1.40 +\/- 1.51 for ETA, and 0.67 +\/- 1.36 for mAb, the difference being statistically significant between RTX and mAb (p < 0.0001). For patients who had failed ETA, RTX led to significantly greater DAS28 reductions than mAb (p = 0.01). When the reason for discontinuation of the previous anti-TNF was intolerance or secondary inefficacy, RTX led to significantly greater DAS28 reduction compared to mAb and ETA (p = 0.01 and p = 0.03, respectively). CONCLUSIONS: In this observational cohort, patients who failed one anti-TNF had better overall results when treated with RTX than with a subsequent anti-TNF mAb. Having failed ETA, RTX yielded greater DAS28 reductions and European League Against Rheumatism (EULAR) responses than mAb. The advantage of RTX was most clearly seen in patients who had failed anti-TNF because of intolerance or secondary inefficacy.",

METHODS: ACT-RAY was a double-blind, 3-year trial. Adults with active rheumatoid arthritis despite methotrexate were randomised to add tocilizumab to ongoing methotrexate (add-on strategy) or to switch to tocilizumab plus placebo (switch strategy). Tocilizumab 8 mg\/kg was administered every 4 weeks.

Co-administration of atorvastatin resulted in a significant reduction of LDL-cholesterol versus placebo (primary endpoint; p<0.0001); from week 6 to week 12 the least squares mean reduction was 35.3% with atorvastatin, versus 5.8% increase with placebo. ACR responses were observed with tofacitinib; numerically greater rates were seen with atorvastatin versus placebo. Adverse events were consistent with phase 3 studies. CONCLUSIONS: Tofacitinib-associated elevated total and LDL-cholesterol and triglycerides were rapidly and significantly reduced by atorvastatin. Further investigation is required to explore the significance of reductions in RA disease activity in patients receiving tofacitinib and atorvastatin. (Pfizer protocol A3921109).",

        "Abstract":"The aim of this study was to define the ultrasonographic factors that indicate clinical remission in patients with RA. We enrolled a cohort of patients with RA in whom the disease had been in remission for at least 6 months. Musculoskeletal ultrasound (US) examination was used to evaluate the status of active synovitis, power Doppler (PD) signalling, and synovitis in the bilateral metacarpophalangeal; proximal interphalangeal; and radiocarpal, ulnocarpal, and intercarpal, compartments of the wrist. A total of 64 RA patients with a mean disease duration of 79.97 months were studied. Of all patients, 36% had ultrasonographic synovitis and 29% an increased PD signal from at least one joint. Delay in diagnosis was highly correlated with synovitis and PD synovitis (r = 0.55, p = 0.000; and r = 0.51, p = 0.001, respectively). A weak negative correlation was evident between synovitis, PD synovitis, tenosynovitis, PD tenosynovitis, and duration of clinical remission (respectively, r = -0.426, p = 0.000; r = -0.333, p = 0.007; r = -0.243, p = 0.050; and r = -0.247, p = 0.049). Upon multivariate logistic regression analysis, the duration of clinical remission and delay in diagnosis were the factors that most influenced ultrasonographic remission (OR 3.46, p = 0.046; OR 3.27, p = 0.016, respectively). Synovial inflammation may persist in RA patients exhibiting clinical remission. We found that US detected subclinical synovitis. The most important factors preventing ultrasonographic remission were a short duration of clinical remission and delay in diagnosis.",

        "Published":"2015 May",
        "Abstract":"BACKGROUND: Rheumatoid arthritis (RA) is a progressive autoimmune disorder of joints that is associated with high health care costs, yet guidance is lacking on how early to initiate biologic disease-modifying antirheumatic drugs (DMARDs), a class of medications that is the major cost driver in RA management. Few studies have examined the factors associated with the transition from nonbiologic DMARDs, the first-line therapy for RA, to biologic DMARDs in RA patients. OBJECTIVE: To examine patient sociodemographics, medication use patterns, and clinical characteristics associated with initiation of biologic DMARDs. METHODS: This was a retrospective study using the Texas Medicaid prescription and medical claims database from July 1, 2003-December 31, 2010. Adults (aged 18-63 years) with an RA diagnosis (ICD-9-CM code 714.xx), no nonbiologic DMARD or biologic DMARD use during the 6-month pre-index period, and a minimum of 2 prescription claims for the same nonbiologic DMARD during the post-index period were included in the study. The index date was defined as the date when the first nonbiologic DMARD claim was made. Predictors of initiation of biologic DMARDs were age, gender, race, adherence (proportion of days covered), persistence to nonbiologic DMARDs, comorbidity (Charlson Comorbidity Index [CCI]), pain medication use, glucocorticoid use, and rheumatologist visit. Logistic regression was used to examine the factors associated with the initiation of biologic DMARDs. RESULTS: A total of 2,714 patients were included. After controlling for patient characteristics, logistic regression showed, that compared with methotrexate (MTX) users, sulfasalazine (SSZ) and hydroxychloroquine (HCQ) users were less likely to initiate biologic DMARDs by 69.0% (OR = 0.310, 95% CI = 0.221-0.434, P less than 0.0001) and 79.9% (OR = 0.201, 95% CI = 0.152-0.265, P less than 0.0001), respectively. Nonbiologic DMARD dual therapy users were 39.1% less likely to initiate biologic DMARDs compared with nonbiologic DMARD monotherapy users (OR = 0.609, 95% CI = 0.463-0.803, P = 0.0004). With each year increase in age, patients were 1.6% less likely to start biologic DMARDs (OR = 0.984, 95% CI = 0.975-0.993, P = 0.0006). Compared with glucocorticoid users, glucocorticoid nonusers were 53.8% less likely to start on biologic DMARDs (OR = 0.462, 95% CI = 0.372-0.573, P less than 0.0001). Patients with CCI scores of >= 3 were approximately 1.6 times more likely to initiate biologic DMARDs than those with CCI scores of 1 (OR = 1.618, 95% CI = 1.228-2.132, P = 0.0006). CONCLUSIONS: Younger age, CCI scores >=3, glucocorticoid use, MTX users (vs. SSZ and HCQ users), and nonbiologic DMARD monotherapy users (vs. dual therapy users) were significantly associated with higher likelihood to initiate biologic DMARDs. Recognizing these potential factors that drive the initiation of biologic DMARDs in this patient population, health care providers and Texas Medicaid should take measures to achieve optimal therapy for RA patients through thorough RA medication evaluation, well-structured RA monitoring programs, and patient education.",

        "Published":"2016 Feb",
        "Abstract":"OBJECTIVE: To determine the relationship between changes in antibody levels towards citrullinated peptides derived from different candidate autoantigens and therapeutic outcome in early rheumatoid arthritis (RA). METHODS: Baseline and 3-month serum samples from 316 patients with early RA enrolled in the Swedish Farmacotherapy (SWEFOT) trial were analysed for antibodies against cyclic citrullinated peptides (CCP) and citrullinated peptides derived from vimentin (cVim), fibrinogen (cFib) and alpha-enolase (CEP-1). At 3-month follow-up, methotrexate monotherapy-inadequate responders were randomised to add-on therapy with sulfasalazine and hydroxychloroquine or infliximab. In these patients, anticitrullinated peptide antibodies (ACPA) were also assessed at 12 and 24 months. The proportion of antibody-positive patients and relative changes in antibody levels were compared across ACPA specificities and related to therapeutic response and radiographic progression. RESULTS: During the 2-year follow-up, the proportion of patients testing positive declined significantly regarding antibodies to cVim, cFib and CEP-1, while anti-CCP antibody occurrence remained stable over time. Turning anti-cVim antibody negative was most common, and anti-cVim antibody seroreversion during the first three months associated with significantly less 2-year radiographic progression compared with patients who remained positive. Median antibody levels of all tested ACPAs declined uniformly during initial methotrexate therapy and following response to add-on therapy, with no significant relation to treatment regimen or radiographic progression. CONCLUSIONS: The influence of early antirheumatic therapy on ACPA seroreversions was markedly different across specificities, and early disappearance of anti-cVim antibodies associated with better radiological outcome. Thus, these data suggest that the disappearance of particular ACPA reactivities may be beneficial in early RA.

        "Published":"2009 Dec",
        "Abstract":"OBJECTIVE: To assess the efficacy, safety, pharmacokinetics, and pharmacodynamics of the CC chemokine receptor CCR1 antagonist MLN3897 in patients with rheumatoid arthritis (RA) receiving methotrexate (MTX). METHODS: In this phase IIa, proof-of-concept study, patients meeting the American College of Rheumatology (ACR) criteria for RA who had been taking MTX for >or=6 months with evidence of active disease were randomly assigned to receive either 10 mg oral MLN3897 or matching placebo once daily for 12 weeks (days 1-83) while continuing to receive MTX once a week. Clinical assessments, safety monitoring, and sampling for pharmacokinetic and pharmacodynamic analyses were performed throughout the study. The primary efficacy end point was the difference in the percentage of patients meeting the ACR 20% improvement criteria (achieving an ACR20 response) on day 84 in the MLN3897-treated group compared with that in the placebo-treated group. RESULTS: MLN3897 was well tolerated, with no evidence of systemic immunosuppression. In the intent-to-treat population, there was no significant difference in day 84 ACR20 response rates between MLN3897-treated patients and placebo-treated patients (35% versus 33%, respectively; P=0.72). Results were similar for the per-protocol population. Pharmacokinetic analyses demonstrated no interactions between MLN3897 and MTX. MLN3897 was associated with a high degree of CCR1 occupancy (>or=90% on days 28, 56, and 84 in 82% of patients, by macrophage inflammatory protein 1alpha internalization assay). CONCLUSION: MLN3897 at a concentration of 10 mg once daily had no discernible activity in patients with RA who were also receiving MTX. The results suggest that CCR1 antagonism is unlikely to be a viable strategy for the treatment of RA when used in isolation at the receptor occupancy levels reached in this study.",

        "Abstract":"Tumor necrosis factor-alpha (TNFalpha)-blocking agents are immunomodulating agents introduced for treatment of a variety of chronic inflammatory disease conditions. Adverse effects include an increased incidence of infections. Clinically, these infections often have atypical presentations that may hamper prompt diagnosis. In our report of a patient on etanercept therapy for rheumatoid arthritis, the correct diagnosis was delayed because disseminated herpes zoster was clinically mimicking vasculitis. Initially assuming rheumatoid vasculitis, immunosuppression was increased, resulting in worsening of skin lesions. Only an extended work-up, including a skin biopsy and viral cultures, established the correct diagnosis. Management of varicella zoster virus (VZV) infection primarily focuses on early initiation of antiviral therapy to control VZV replication. Therapy with intravenous acyclovir followed by oral valacyclovir allowed complete resolution of acute skin changes. In immunosuppressed patients, the possibility of infection with atypical presentation must always be kept in mind, and that this might mimic other disease conditions. Broad differential diagnosis and an extended diagnostic workup help in establishing the correct diagnosis. Copyright 2009 S. Karger AG, Basel.",

        "Abstract":"OBJECTIVES: Although treatment of rheumatoid arthritis (RA) has progressed by the use of biologics, amyloid A (AA) amyloidosis is still an intractable complication in patients with RA. In the present study, safety and efficacy of 1-year treatment with an anti-IL-6 receptor antibody tocilizumab (TCZ) on RA and AA amyloidosis were estimated. METHODS: TCZ (8 mg\/kg every 4 weeks) was administered to five RA patients complicated with AA amyloidosis. The primary end point was improvement in renal dysfunction and the secondary end point was CDAI at 1 year after the treatment. RESULTS: An improvement in the renal dysfunction, including urinary protein secretion, was found, in four patients including two patients who were refractory to etanercept, with a remarkable decrease of SAA concentration, and the progression of organ dysfunction was prevented at 1 year in all patients treated with TCZ. The mean clinical disease activity index decreased from 33.9 to 4.7 (p = 0.012) in five patients treated with TCZ for 1 year. Three non-serious adverse events were observed in two patients. CONCLUSIONS: TCZ ameliorates renal dysfunction in RA patients complicated with AA amyloidosis who are refractory to conventional therapies, thereby suggesting that TCZ has a potential to regulate AA amyloidosis.",

        "Published":"1996 Mar",
        "Abstract":"Although factors that appear to predict long-term outcomes of rheumatoid arthritis have been identified, there is no consensus about the treatment early in the disease. To determine how French office- and hospital-based rheumatologists treat early rheumatoid arthritis, we created three clinical vignettes corresponding to different levels of severity of early rheumatoid arthritis (less than six months' disease duration). Cases 1 and 2 were relatively young patients (35 and 50 years), and Case 1 had numerous poor prognosis factors. Case 3 was 80 years of age. Rheumatologists were asked to indicate which medications they would use at presentation and after one year of a favorable or unfavorable course. The study was conducted by questionnaire (response rate, 58%). Of the 185 rheumatologists who completed the questionnaire, 81% were male and 19% female; mean age was 42 +\/- 8 years. In Cases 1 and 2, nonsteroidal antiinflammatory drugs were given by 99% of respondents; second-line drugs were prescribed at presentation by 93% of respondents in Case 1 and 86% in Case 2, and methotrexate was more likely to be used in the presence of poor prognosis factors (23% in case 1 and 7% in Case 2). In the event of an unfavorable course after one year, a larger proportion of rheumatologists prescribed glucocorticoid therapy (65% in Case 1 and 20% in Case 2), and there was a shift from \"conventional\" to \"modern\" second-line drugs, with more widespread use of methotrexate (65% in case 1 and 18% in case 2). In the 80-year-old patient, glucocorticoid therapy was used more often than nonsteroidal antiinflammatory drugs and second-line drugs (gold salts, hydroxychloroquine, sulfasalazine) were prescribed by 40% of rheumatologists at presentation and by 67% after one year of an unfavorable course; in the latter situation, methotrexate was selected in 24% of cases. In contrast to conventional recommendations, many French office- or hospital-based rheumatologists use second-line drugs very early and base their choice of medications on the estimated risk of severe disease and on the age of the patient.",

        "Published":"2018 Sep",
        "Abstract":"AIM: To examine the efficacy of abatacept in patients with rheumatoid arthritis (RA) using magnetic resonance imaging (MRI) of bilateral hands. METHOD: This prospective study included 35 RA patients. MRI of bilateral hands was performed at baseline and after 12 months of treatment with intravenous abatacept. MRI images were scored for synovitis, osteitis, erosion and joint space narrowing (JSN) according to the RA MRI Scoring System (RAMRIS). The primary endpoint was the change in RAMRIS score from baseline. Repair of erosion was defined as a negative change in the erosion score that was greater than the smallest detectable changes (SDCs). RESULTS: Thirty-one patients completed the study. Median synovitis and osteitis scores showed statistically significant reductions at Month 12 when compared to baseline (synovitis score, -5.5 [P < 0.0001]; osteitis score, -0.5 [P = 0.03]). However, median erosion and JSN scores did not significantly change. At Month 12, 83% of patients showed no progression of erosion scores and repair of erosion was observed in 11% of patients. All patients with repair of erosion achieved functional remission (Health Assessment Questionnaire-Disability Index <= 0.5). The Simplified Disease Activity Index response rate at Month 1 was identified as an independent factor predicting changes in the erosion scores at Month 12. CONCLUSION: Abatacept treatment reduced synovitis and osteitis scores and did not worsen erosion and JSN scores at Month 12. Over 10% of patients experienced repair of erosion.
