        "a": "One of the included trials had a high risk of bias.",
        "b": "There was a total of 15 events among the 285 participants enrolled in the two trials. The total number of events is lower than the number needed to reach the optimal information size (i.e., 300).",
        "c": "I-squared was greater than 50%.",
        "d": "There was a total of 2 events among the 234 participants enrolled in the two trials. The total number of events is lower than the number needed to reach the optimal information size (i.e., 300).",
        "e": "One of the included trials had a high risk of bias and another had some concerns with risk of bias.",
        "f": "There was a total of 2 events among the 201 participants enrolled in the three trials. The total number of events is lower than the number needed to reach the optimal information size (i.e., 300)."
