        "Abstract":"BACKGROUND: On-pump valve surgeries are associated with high morbidity and mortality. The present study aimed to reliably predict a composite outcome of postoperative complications using a minimum of easily accessible clinical parameters.\nMETHODS: A total of 7,441 patients who underwent valve surgery were retrospectively analyzed. Data for 6,220 patients at West China Hospital of Sichuan University were used to develop a predictive model, which was validated using data from 1,221 patients at the Second Affiliated Hospital of Zhejiang University School of Medicine. The primary outcome was a composite of major complications: all-cause death in hospital, stroke, myocardial infarction, and severe acute kidney injury. The predictive model was constructed using the least absolute shrinkage and selection operator as well as multivariable logistic regression. The model was assessed in terms of the areas under receiver operating characteristic curves, calibration, and decision curve analysis.\nRESULTS: The primary outcome occurred in 129 patients (2.1%) in the development cohort and 71 (5.8%) in the validation cohort. Six variables were retained in the predictive model: New York Heart Association class, diabetes, glucose, blood urea nitrogen, operation time, and red blood cell transfusion during surgery. The C-statistics were 0.735 (95% CI, 0.686-0.784) in the development cohort and 0.761 (95% CI, 0.694-0.828) in the validation cohort. For both cohorts, calibration plots showed good agreement between predicted and actual observations, and ecision curve analysis showed clinical usefulness. In contrast, the well-established SinoSCORE did not accurately predict the primary outcome in either cohort.\nCONCLUSIONS: This predictive nomogram based on six easily accessible variables may serve as an \"early warning\" system to identify patients at high risk of major complications after valve surgery.\nCLINICAL TRIAL REGISTRATION: [www.ClinicalTrials.gov], identifier [NCT04476134].",

        "Abstract":"BACKGROUND: Dyslipidemia is a risk factor for the development of atherosclerosis and ischemic heart disease. Statins are safe drugs that are part of the routine treatment in patients with Acute Myocardial Infarction (AMI), however, rhabdomyolysis associated with severe myonecrosis due to statins can occur and associated complications such as acute kidney injury increase mortality. The main objective of this article is to report the case of a critically ill patient with AMI who presented severe statin-associated rhabdomyolysis documented with muscle biopsy.\nDESCRIPTION OF THE CASE: A 54-year-old man who presented with AMI, cardiogenic shock, and cardiorespiratory arrest requiring cardiopulmonary resuscitation, fibrinolysis, and successful salvage coronary angiography. However, he presented severe rhabdomyolysis associated with atorvastatin that required suspension of the drug and multi-organ support in a Coronary Care Unit.\nCONCLUSIONS: The prevalence of statin-associated rhabdomyolysis is low, however, the late elevation of CPK above 10 times its upper normal value in those patients with successful percutaneous coronary angiography should promptly draw attention, generate a diagnostic approach towards non-traumatic acquired causes of rhabdomyolysis and assess the suspension of statins.",

        "Published":"2023-02-11",
        "Abstract":"INTRODUCTION: Acute kidney injury (AKI) is a common complication in cardiac surgery patients and prevention is needed to improve clinical outcomes. Alpha-1-microglobulin (A1M) is a physiological antioxidant with strong tissue-protective and cell-protective properties that has demonstrated renoprotective effects. RMC-035, a recombinant variant of endogenous human A1M, is being developed for the prevention of AKI in cardiac surgery patients.\nMETHODS: In this phase 1b, randomized, double-blind, and parallel group clinical study, 12 cardiac surgery patients undergoing elective, open-chest, on-pump coronary artery bypass graft and\/or valve surgery with additional predisposing AKI risk factors were enrolled to receive in total 5 intravenous doses of either RMC-035 or placebo. The primary objective was to evaluate the safety and tolerability of RMC-035. The secondary objective was to evaluate its pharmacokinetic properties.\nRESULTS: RMC-035 was well tolerated. The nature and frequency of adverse events (AEs) were consistent with the expected background rates in the underlying patient population with no AEs reported as related to study drug. No clinically relevant changes were observed for vital signs or laboratory parameters except for renal biomarkers. Several established AKI urine biomarkers were reduced at 4 hours after first dose administration in the treatment group, indicating a reduced perioperative tubular cell injury following RMC-035 treatment.\nCONCLUSION: Multiple intravenous doses of RMC-035 were well tolerated in patients undergoing cardiac surgery. Observed RMC-035 plasma exposures were safe and in the range of expected pharmacological activity. Furthermore, urine biomarkers suggest reduced perioperative kidney cell injury, warranting further investigation of RMC-035 as a potential renoprotective treatment.",

        "Abstract":"This experiment aimed to study the risk factors of carbapenem-resistant Gram-negative bacteria pneumonia and death. For this aim, a total of 181 patients with Gram-negative bacterial pneumonia treated from March 2020 to March 2022 were retrospectively selected and divided into the drug-resistance group (n = 96) and the non-drug resistance group (n = 85) according to the carbapenem resistance. According to the prognosis, the drug resistance group was divided into the survival group (n = 82) and the non-survival group (n = 14), respectively. The risk factors of single and multi-factor carbapenem-resistant Gram-negative bacteria pneumonia and death were studied. Results showed that univariate analysis showed that the rates of recent surgery, respiratory failure, shock, indwelling catheterization and disturbance of consciousness were significantly higher in the drug-resistant group than in the non-drug-resistant group. The univariate analysis also showed that the rates of coronary heart disease, diabetes, shock, renal insufficiency, deep venous catheterization and respiratory failure were significantly higher in the non-survival group than in the survival group. Multivariate analysis showed an increased risk of carbapenem-resistant gram-negative pneumonia in patients who had used carbapenem-resistant antibiotics, hypertension, coronary heart disease, and malignancy in the previous 90 days. Patients with carbapenem-resistant gram-negative pneumonia who had coronary heart disease, diabetes mellitus, shock, renal insufficiency, deep venous catheterization, and respiratory failure were at increased risk of death. In conclusion, recent surgery, respiratory failure, shock, indwelling catheterization, and disturbance of consciousness are risk factors for carbapenem-resistant Gram-negative bacteria pneumonia. Coronary heart disease, diabetes mellitus, shock, renal insufficiency, deep venous catheterization and respiratory failure are risk factors for death from carbapenem-resistant gram-negative bacteria pneumonia.",

        "Abstract":"p\nCurrent guidelines recommend delaying noncardiac surgery for 6 months after drug eluting stent implantation. However, this recommendation is largely based on limited evidence and various event definitions. Whether early surgery within 6 months of coronary stent implantation increases myocardial injury in patients with normal preoperative high-sensitivity cardiac troponin I (hs-cTnI) has not yet been investigated. This retrospective study assessed patients who received coronary stent implantation and underwent noncardiac surgery (vascular, abdominal, or thoracic) between 2010 and 2017 with normal preoperative hs-cTnI (n = 186). Patients were divided into early (within 6 months of PCI) and late (after 6 months of PCI) groups. The primary endpoint was the incidence of myocardial injury as diagnosed by hs-cTnI within 3 days post-operation. The secondary outcomes were myocardial infarction, stent thrombosis, emergent coronary revascularization, major bleeding (bleeding requiring transfusion or intracranial bleeding), stroke, renal failure, heart failure, or death within 30 days post-operation. Inverse probability treatment weighting (IPTW) was carried out to adjust for the intergroup baseline differences. Myocardial injury occurred in 28.6% (8\/28) and 27.8% (44\/158) of the early and late groups, respectively, with no difference between groups (odds ratio [OR] 1.067, 95% confidence interval [CI] 0.404, 2.482;  = 0.886). Secondary outcomes did not differ between the groups. IPTW analysis also showed no differences in myocardial injury and secondary outcomes between the groups. In conclusion, early surgery within 6 months after coronary stent implantation did not increase the incidence of myocardial injury in patients with normal preoperative hs-cTnI.",

        "Abstract":"2\nThe relation between chronic kidney disease (CKD) and outcomes in patients receiving percutaneous coronary intervention (PCI) is thought to be bidirectional; these patients are at a higher risk of ischemic and bleeding events. From a Japanese nationwide PCI registry, ischemic (cardiovascular death, nonfatal myocardial infarction, or nonfatal ischemic stroke) and bleeding events (fatal or nonfatal major bleeding) 1 year after discharge among patients who had second- or newer-generation drug-eluting stent implantation were analyzed. Patients on oral anticoagulants were excluded. Patients were stratified according to their preprocedural renal function: CKD stages 1 to 2 (estimated glomerular filtration rate [eGFR] ≥60 ml\/min\/1.73 m), 3 (eGFR 30 to 59), or 4 to 5 (eGFR <30), or those receiving dialysis. Overall, 23,349 patients, including 2,798 patients with CKD 3 to 5 (12.0%) and 1,464 patients on dialysis (6.3%), were investigated. One-year ischemic events were observed in 1.5%, 5.2%, 9.7%, and 5.3% in the CKD stages 1-to-2, 3, 4-to-5, and dialysis groups, respectively; patients with CKD stages 3 or 4 to 5 and those receiving dialysis were associated with higher risks of ischemic events after adjustment of covariates than were patients without CKD. Compared with ischemic events, 1-year bleeding events were low, with incidence rates of 1.5%, 2.0%, 3.4%, and 2.3%, respectively. Furthermore, the presence of CKD or dialysis was not associated with a higher risk of bleeding events after adjustment of covariates. In conclusion, in the contemporary nationwide PCI registry, the presence of CKD and dialysis was independently associated with a higher risk of ischemic events but not with bleeding events, and this suggests a need to alter the models of care delivery in these patients.",

        "Published":"2023-03-28",
        "Abstract":"PURPOSE: This study investigated the long-term outcomes of patients treated with fenestrated and branched endovascular aneurysm repair (F-BEVAR) or open surgical repair (OSR) for complex abdominal aortic aneurysms (c-AAAs). Complex abdominal aortic aneurysms are defined as aneurysms that involve the renal or mesenteric arteries and extend up to the level of the celiac axis or diaphragmatic hiatus but do not extend into the thoracic aorta. This study compares with a propensity-score matching the outcome of these procedures from 2 high-volume aortic centers.\nMATERIALS AND METHODS: All patients with c-AAAs undergoing repair at 2 centers between January 2010 and June 2016 were included. The long-term imaging follow-up consisted in a yearly computed tomography angiography (CTA) in the F-BEVAR group. Yearly abdominal ultrasound examination and 5-year CTA were performed in the OSR group. The primary endpoints were long-term mortality, aneurysm-related mortality, and chronic renal decline (CRD), defined as estimated glomerular filtration rate reduction to <60 mL\/min\/1.73 m or >20%\/de novo dependence on permanent dialysis in patients with normal or abnormal preoperative renal function, respectively. Secondary endpoints included aortic-related reinterventions, target vessel occlusion, proximal aorta degeneration, access-related complications, graft infection, and the composite endpoint of clinical failure during follow-up.\nRESULTS: After 1:1 propensity matching, 102 consecutive patients who underwent F-BEVAR and OSR, respectively, were included. The median follow-up was 67 months. There was no significant difference in long-term overall mortality (40.2% vs 36.3%; p=0.40) and aneurysm-related mortality (6.8% vs 5.8%; p=0.30), in the F-BEVAR and OSR groups, respectively. During follow-up, late renal function decline occurred in 27 (27.8%) versus 46 patients (47.4%) in the F-BEVAR and OSR groups, respectively (p<0.01). During follow-up, 23 reinterventions (23.5%) were performed in the F-BEVAR group, and 5 (5.1%) in the OSR group (p<0.01).\nCONCLUSIONS: No differences in overall and aneurysm-related mortality were observed. Chronic renal decline was significantly higher after OSR, while the reintervention rate was higher in the F-BEVAR group. These long-term results reflect the outcomes of a complex procedure performed by a single experienced operator in 2 high-volume centers, and followed with a strict surveillance imaging follow-up.\nCLINICAL IMPACT: Nowadays, F-BEVAR and OSR are considered two established techniques for the treatment of c-AAA. However, long-term comparative outcomes are not well studied, and concerns may rise in terms of durability of the repair, risk of reinterventions and late chronic renal decline. The present study showed, with a median follow-up > 5 years, no differences in overall and aneurysm-related mortality. Chronic renal decline was significantly higher after OSR, while the reintervention rate was higher in the endovascular group. To achieve the best possible long-term outcomes, both techniques should be performed in high volume aortic centres, tailored to the patient, and with an adequate surveillance imaging.",

        "Abstract":"IMPORTANCE: In a porcine model of liver transplant, a combined drug approach that targeted the donor graft and graft recipient reduced ischemia-reperfusion injury, a major hurdle to the success of liver transplant.\nOBJECTIVE: To assess the effect of a clinical form of a perioperative combined drug approach delivered immediately before implantation to the procured liver and to the liver recipient on the degree of ischemia-reperfusion injury.\nDESIGN, SETTING, AND PARTICIPANTS: This unicentric, investigator-driven, open-label randomized clinical trial with 2 parallel arms was conducted in Belgium from September 2013 through February 2018, with 1-year follow-up. Adults wait-listed for a first solitary full-size liver transplant were screened for eligibility. Exclusion criteria were acute liver failure, kidney failure, contraindication to treatment, participation in another trial, refusal, technical issues, and death while awaiting transplant. Included patients were enrolled and randomized at the time of liver offer. Data were analyzed from May 20, 2019, to May 27, 2020.\nINTERVENTIONS: Participants were randomized to a combined drug approach with standard of care (static cold storage) or standard of care only (control group). In the combined drug approach group, following static cold preservation, donor livers were infused with epoprostenol (ex situ, portal vein); recipients were given oral α-tocopherol and melatonin prior to anesthesia and intravenous antithrombin III, infliximab, apotransferrin, recombinant erythropoietin-β, C1-inhibitor, and glutathione during the anhepatic and reperfusion phase.\nMAIN OUTCOMES AND MEASURES: The primary outcome was the posttransplant peak serum aspartate aminotransferase (AST) level within the first 72 hours. Secondary end points were the frequencies of postreperfusion syndrome, ischemia-reperfusion injury score, early allograft dysfunction, surgical complications, ischemic cholangiopathy, acute kidney injury, acute cellular rejection, and graft and patient survival.\nRESULTS: Of 93 randomized patients, 21 were excluded, resulting in 72 patients (36 per study arm) in the per protocol analysis (median recipient age, 60 years [IQR, 51.7-66.2 years]; 52 [72.2%] men). Peak AST serum levels were not different in the combined drug approach and control groups (geometric mean, 1262.9 U\/L [95% CI, 946.3-1685.4 U\/L] vs 1451.2 U\/L [95% CI, 1087.4-1936.7 U\/L]; geometric mean ratio, 0.87 [95% CI, 0.58-1.31]; P = .49) (to convert AST to μkat\/L, multiply by 0.0167). There also were no significant differences in the secondary end points between the groups.\nCONCLUSIONS AND RELEVANCE: In this randomized clinical trial, the combined drug approach targeting the post-cold storage graft and the recipient did not decrease ischemic-reperfusion injury. The findings suggest that in addition to a downstream strategy that targets the preimplantation liver graft and the graft recipient, a clinically effective combined drug approach may need to include an upstream strategy that targets the donor graft during preservation. Dynamic preservation strategies may provide an appropriate delivery platform.\nTRIAL REGISTRATION: ClinicalTrials.gov Identifier: NCT02251041.",

However, TAT is not extensively used because of the risk of bleeding. This study aimed to determine the utilization and influencing factors of TAT using real-world data in the non-vitamin K antagonist oral anticoagulants (NOACs) era.\nMETHODS: We analyzed National Inpatient Sample data compiled by the Health Insurance Review & Assessment Service (HIRA-NIS) from 2011 to 2020. Patients with AF who underwent PCI with stent implantation and with an increased stroke risk were selected as candidates for TAT therapy. Demographic and clinical factors associated with TAT use were investigated using the chi-squared test and the Student t-test, and influencing factors were identified using multiple logistic regression.\nRESULTS: The TAT utilization rate steadily increased from 30.3% in 2011 to 65.4% in 2020 (Cochran-Armitage trend test: p < 0.001) with an average of 45.9%. Positive influencing factors for TAT use were identified as congestive heart failure, history of previous stroke\/transient ischemic attack\/thromboembolism, valvular heart disease, and year. Negative influencing factors included insurance type (medical aid or Patriots & Veterans Insurance), type of medical institution (general hospitals or primary medical institutions), and comorbidities such as renal disease, liver disease, and history of the previous hemorrhage.\nCONCLUSIONS: The utilization of TAT following PCI among high-stroke risk AF patients steadily increased from 2011 to 2020, reaching 65.4% by the end of the study period.

        "Abstract":"BACKGROUND: For patients with ST-elevation myocardial infarction (STEMI), early reperfusion with primary percutaneous coronary intervention (PPCI) or thrombolytic treatment is essential to prevent major adverse cardiac events. The aim of the study is to compare the current status of managing STEMI patients at **** with European Society of Cardiology guidelines recommendations. Prospective cohort of all patients presenting with ST-elevation myocardial infarction (STEMI) between March 2020 and February 2021 in Alexandria University hospitals. Reporting patterns, causes of delay, and reperfusion status for all STEMI patients were noted. MACE: (Mortality, Re-infarction, Stroke, or Heart failure) was reported and compared among different management strategies.\nRESULTS: The study was conducted over one year on 436 patients, 280 (64.2%) of them underwent PPCI, 32 (7.3%) received thrombolysis, and 124 (28.5%) had a conservative strategy. Patients' mean age was 55.2 years, 72.2% were smokers and 80.9% were men. Family history was positive in 14.2% of patients, 33.5% had diabetes, 7.3% had renal impairment, and 41.5% had hypertension. The median pre-hospital waiting time was 360 min; the mean pre-hospital waiting time was 629.0 ± 796.7 min. The median Emergency Room waiting time was 48.24 ± 89.30 min. The median time from CCU admission to wire crossing was 40.0 min with a mean value 53.86 ± 49.0 min. The mean ischemia duration was 408 min, while the total ischemic time was 372 min. All patients who presented within 12 h received reperfusion therapy either a PPCI or thrombolysis at a rate of 71.5%, with 35.0% of those patients achieving prompt reperfusion in accordance with ESC guidelines. The PPCI group mortality rate was 2.9%, in comparison to 12.9% in the conservative group, which was statistically significant (P < 0.001). Overall in-hospital mortality was 5.5%, and total MACE was 27.3%. A statistically significant difference was observed between the three management groups as regards MACE rate, being 15%, 28.1%, and 54.8% in PPCI, thrombolysis, and conservative groups, respectively.\nCONCLUSIONS: Despite financial and technical constraints, appropriate, timely reperfusion was near to achieving the ESC guidelines for the management of STEMI. The most common reperfusion strategy was PPCI, with an in-hospital death rate of less than 5% in the PPCI group. There was a concern about the increase in the total ischemia time due to some financial and technical constraints.",

        "Abstract":"BACKGROUND: Diabetes mellitus (DM) is a critical risk factor for the pathogenesis and progression of coronary artery disease, with a higher prevalence of complex coronary artery disease, including bifurcation lesions. This study aimed to elucidate the optimal stenting strategy for coronary bifurcation lesions in patients with DM.\nMETHODS: A total of 905 patients with DM and bifurcation lesions treated with second-generation drug-eluting stents (DES) from a multicenter retrospective patient cohort were analyzed. The primary outcome was the 5-year incidence of target lesion failure (TLF), which was defined as a composite of cardiac death, target vessel myocardial infarction, and target lesion revascularization.\nRESULTS: Among all patients with DM with significant bifurcation lesions, 729 (80.6%) and 176 (19.4%) were treated with one- and two-stent strategies, respectively. TLF incidence differed according to the stenting strategy during the mean follow-up of 42 ± 20 months. Among the stent strategies, T- and V-stents were associated with a higher TLF incidence than one-stent strategy (24.0 vs. 7.3%,  < 0.001), whereas no difference was observed in TLF between the one-stent strategy and crush or culotte technique (7.3 vs. 5.9%,  = 0.645). The T- or V-stent technique was an independent predictor of TLF in multivariate analysis (hazard ratio, 3.592; 95% confidence interval, 2.117-6.095;  < 0.001). Chronic kidney disease, reduced left ventricular ejection fraction, and left main bifurcation were independent predictors of TLF in patients with DM.\nCONCLUSION: T- or V-stenting in patients with DM resulted in increased cardiovascular events after second-generation DES implantation.\nCLINICAL TRIAL REGISTRATION: https:\/\/clinicaltrials.gov\/ct2\/show\/NCT03068494?term=03068494&draw=2&rank=1, identifier: NCT03068494.",

        "Published":"2022-12-08",
        "Abstract":"BACKGROUND: Left ventricular thrombus (LVT) is a well-recognized complication of myocardial infarction (MI) in patients with diabetes. An embolic complication caused by LVT is a key clinical problem and is associated with worsened long-term survival.\nCASE PRESENTATION: A 45-year-old man with persistent left abdominal pain for 1 week and left leg fatigue was admitted to the emergency department. The cause of abdominal pain was embolism of the renal artery, the splenic artery, and the superior mesenteric artery caused by cardiogenic thrombosis, which further led to splenic infarction and renal infarction. It was unclear when MI occurred because the patient had no typical critical chest pain, which may have been related to diabetic complications, such as diabetic peripheral neuropathy. Diabetes plays a pivotal role in MI and LVT formation. Because coronary angiography suggested triple vessel disease, percutaneous transluminal coronary angioplasty (PTCA) was conducted, and two drug-eluting stents were placed in the left anterior descending coronary artery (LAD). Due to a lack of randomized clinical control trials, the therapy of LVT and associated embolization has been actively debated. According to the present guidelines, this patient was treated with low-molecular-weight heparin and warfarin (oral anticoagulants) for 3 months in addition to aspirin (100 mg\/day) and clopidogrel (75 mg\/day) for 1 year. No serious bleeding complications were noted, and a follow-up examination showed no thrombus in the left ventricle or further peripheral thrombotic events.\nCONCLUSION: Peripheral embolization of LVT caused by MI leading to multiple organ embolization remains a rare occurrence. Diabetes plays a pivotal role in MI and LVT formation. Successful revascularization of the infarct-related coronary artery and anticoagulation therapy is important to minimize myocardial damage and prevent LVT. The present case will help clinicians recognize and manage LVT in patients with diabetes and related peripheral arterial thrombotic events with anticoagulation.",

A retrospective analysis of a large national data set from the Taiwan Cancer Registry Database was conducted. At least two claims for patients with a principal diagnosis of sarcopenia within the 12-month preoperative period were defined as the criteria for sarcopenia diagnosis (ICD-10-CM code M62.84). Sarcopenia was diagnosed through the measurement of low muscle strength and low muscle mass by any one of the patient's attending orthopaedic physician, rehabilitation physician, family medicine specialist or geriatrician. A multivariate logistic regression model was used to calculate the perioperative, and postoperative major complications.\nRESULTS: Our final cohort included 16 293 patients with OCSCC (10 862 and 5 431 in the sarcopenia and nonsarcopenia groups, respectively) who were eligible for further analysis. The sarcopenia group was 10.40% female and 89.60% male, and the nonsarcopenia group was 9.74% female and 90.26% male. The mean age ± standard deviation (SD) were 56.44 ± 11.14 and 56.22 ± 11.29 for sarcopenia and nonsarcopenia groups.

Fourteen updated consensus statements integrate recent trial data and other evidence, with a focus on high bleeding risk. Guideline recommendations, when present, are highlighted, as well as gaps in evidence. Key consensus points include efforts to improve medical adherence through deprescribing and polypill use; adoption of universal risk definitions for bleeding, myocardial infarction, stroke and cause-specific death; multiple bleeding-avoidance strategies, ranging from gastroprotection with aspirin use to selection of antithrombotic-drug composition, dosing and duration tailored to multiple variables (setting, history, overall risk, age, weight, renal function, comedications, procedures) that need special consideration when managing older adults.",

        "Published":"2022-11-29",
        "Abstract":"PURPOSE: Chronic kidney disease (CKD) is a risk factor for ischemic and bleeding events with dual antiplatelet therapy after percutaneous coronary intervention (PCI). Whether the presence of CYP2C19 loss of function (LOF) alleles modifies this risk, and whether a genotype-guided (GG) escalation of P2Y inhibitor therapy post PCI is safe in this population is unclear.\nMETHODS: This was a post hoc analysis of randomized patients in TAILOR PCI. Patients were divided into two groups based on estimated glomerular filtration rate (eGFR) threshold of < 60 ml\/min\/1.73 m for CKD (n = 539) and non-CKD (n = 4276). The aggregate of cardiovascular death, stroke, myocardial infarction, stent thrombosis, and severe recurrent coronary ischemia at 12-months post-PCI was assessed as the primary endpoint. Secondary endpoint was major or minor bleeding.\nRESULTS: Mean (standard deviation) eGFR among patients with CKD was 49.5 (8.4) ml\/min\/1.72 m. Among all patients, there was no significant interaction between randomized strategy and CKD status for any endpoint. Among LOF carriers, the interaction between randomized strategy and CKD status on composite ischemic outcome was not significant (p = 0.2). GG strategy was not associated with an increased risk of bleeding in either CKD group.\nCONCLUSIONS: In this exploratory analysis, escalation of P2Y inhibitor therapy following a GG strategy did not reduce the primary outcome in CKD. However, P2Y inhibitor escalation following a GG strategy was not associated with increased bleeding risk in CKD.

        "Abstract":"BACKGROUND: Diabetes is one of the most common chronic diseases in the world. End-stage renal disease (ESRD) caused by diabetes is the most serious long-term complication. The main cause of death in patients with simultaneous pancreas-kidney transplantation (SPKT) is cardiovascular disease. Although dexmedetomidine (Dex) has unique advantages in heart protection against ischaemic\/reperfusion injury, few clinical studies have been conducted on its cardioprotective effect in SPKT. This study aimed to explore the influence of Dex on myocardial injury in patients undergoing SPKT and to analyze its possible mechanism.\nMETHODS: A randomized controlled trial (RCT) was performed from July 1, 2018 to December 1, 2020. Eighty patients, regardless of gender, scheduled for SPKT were randomly allocated into a Dex group (D group) receiving Dex at a rate of 1 g\/kg for 10 minutes before anaesthesia induction and then continuous infusion at 0.5 g\/kg\/hour until the end of surgery and control group (C group) receiving equivalent capacity of saline. Serum cardiac troponin I (cTnI), creatine kinase isoenzyme (CK-MB), tumour necrosis factor- (TNF-), and interleukin-6 (IL-6) were recorded at 5 minutes after anaesthesia induction (baseline,T0), 5 minutes before renal arteriovenous opening (T1), 30 minutes after renal arteriovenous opening (T2), 30 minutes after pancreatic related arteriovenous opening (T3), immediately after surgery (T4), 4 hours after surgery (T5), and 24 hours after surgery (T6). Adverse cardiovascular events were recorded during the perioperative period. Changes in ECG S-T segments and  waves were monitored at T0-T6. Myocardial infarction and percutaneous coronary intervention were recorded with an average follow-up of one year.\nRESULTS: Compared with T0, TNF- and IL-6 concentrations significantly increased at T1-T6 in the C and D groups ( < 0.05). IL-6 concentration increased significantly after renal artery opening and reached the peak after the opening of pancreatic blood vessels. Compared with the C group, TNF-, and IL-6 concentrations were significantly reduced in group D at T2-T6 ( < 0.05). Compared with T0, cTnI and CK-MB concentrations were significantly increased at T3-T6 in the C and D groups ( < 0.05). cTnI and CK-MB concentrations increased significantly after the opening of renal artery, and reached the peak after the opening of pancreatic blood vessels. Compared with the C group, cTnI and CK-MB concentrations were significantly reduced in the D group at T3-T6 ( < 0.05). There was no significant difference in patient characteristics amongst groups, including the proportion of intraoperative vasoactive drug use and adverse cardiovascular events during the follow-up period. Heart rate, mean blood pressure, central venous pressure, and cardiac output were not remarkably different between the two groups at any time point.\nCONCLUSIONS: Perioperative reperfusion could aggravate myocardial injury in SPKT. Dex may be considered a way to reduce myocardial injury caused by inflammatory action by decreasing the release of inflammatory factors.

        "Published":"2022-10-28",
        "Abstract":"INTRODUCTION: Non-valvular atrial fibrillation (NVAF) is a high-risk factor for ischaemic stroke. The 2016 European Society of Cardiology Atrial Fibrillation Management guidelines recommend oral anticoagulants (OACs) to prevent stroke in men with CHADS-VASc scores ≥2 and women ≥3. However, in patients with a high risk of stroke and a high risk of bleeding (HAS-BLED (Hypertension, Abnormal renal\/liver function, Stroke, Bleeding history or predisposition, Labile international normalized ratio, Elderly (> 65 years), Drugs\/alcohol concomitantly) score≥3), OAC had a higher risk of bleeding. Left atrial appendage closure (LAAC) is non-inferior to OAC as a means of preventing stroke in several studies. As a minimally invasive intervention to prevent stroke, transthoracic LAAC (TS-LAAC) has a high successful closure rate, but there is a lack of literature reports directly comparing it with OAC. Our research compares TS-LAAC with novel oral anticoagulants (NOACs) and provides an appropriate programme for stroke prevention in a specific population.\nMETHODS AND ANALYSIS: This is a non-randomised controlled trial study protocol, and we will conduct this study from April 2022 to April 2025. The study included 186 patients with confirmed NVAF, 93 of whom completed thoracoscopic LAAC, and the control group treated with NOACs. The primary outcome was the incidence of stroke and systemic embolism, as well as the composite endpoint events (stroke, systemic embolism, myocardial infarction, bleeding, cardiovascular death, etc). Secondary outcomes were ischaemic stroke, haemorrhagic stroke, any bleeding events, death from cardiovascular causes, death from all causes, residual root rate in the surgery group, device-related thrombosis in the surgery group, changes in blood pressure, cardiac chamber size changes, etc. Each subject completed at least 1 year of follow-up.\nETHICS AND DISSEMINATION: The study has been approved by the Medical Ethics Committee of Beijing Tiantan Hospital, Capital Medical University, China (approval number: KY2022-013-02).

        "Abstract":"PURPOSE: We investigated the influence of impaired renal function on fundus characteristics, pars-plana vitrectomy (PPV) details, and outcomes in patients with proliferative diabetic retinopathy (PDR).\nDESIGN: A retrospective cohort study.\nMETHODS: We investigated a consecutive series of PDR patients who underwent PPV. The diabetic complications, previous photocoagulation, intravitreal injections before PPV, ocular findings during PPV, surgical details, short-term visual outcome and post-PPV complications were recorded and compared between patients with and without impaired renal function.\nRESULTS: 149 patients had normal renal function (67.7%), and 71 (32.3%) patients had impaired renal function; 85.4% of patients were identified with chronic kidney disease (CKD) during the preoperative assessment. Impaired renal function was related to hypertension (3.40[1.58-7.29], p = 0.002), incomplete pan-retinal photocoagulation (PRP) (3.18[1.50-6.72], p = 0.002), severe fibrovascular membrane (8.19[3.43-19.54], p<0.001), and extensive retinal vascular closure (3.40[1.54-7.52], p = 0.002). There was a more frequent occurrence of severe intraoperative bleeding (56.3%, 32.2%, p = 0.001) and a higher percentage of intraocular subretinal fluid drainage (45.1%, 22.1%, p = 0.008) in patients with impaired renal function. The percentage of patients whose visual acuity (VA) increased was similar between the two groups (42.3%, 54.4%, p = 0.34).\nCONCLUSIONS: In PDR patients, screening for CKD was required before PPV. PDR patients with impaired renal function tended to have more severe ischemic retinal conditions. Comparable PPV outcomes could be obtained in patients with and without impaired renal damage.",

We aimed to compare postapproval outcomes and costs of Impella versus IABP support for high-risk PCI in real-world practice across hospitals in the United States. We identified patients from the Premier Healthcare Database undergoing nonemergent Impella- or IABP-supported high-risk PCI. We used propensity adjustment to control baseline, procedure, and post-PCI medical treatment differences between treatment groups. We included patients undergoing nonemergent single-PCI procedures with either Impella or IABP support and excluded patients presenting with acute ST-elevation myocardial infarction or cardiogenic shock or requiring >1 mechanical support devices during index hospitalization. Outcomes included in-hospital survival, myocardial infarction (MI), cardiogenic shock, stroke, bleeding requiring transfusion, acute kidney injury, index hospitalization length of stay, and costs. From April 2016 to June 2019, a total of 48,179 patients were treated with Impella or IABP mechanical circulatory support at 304 hospitals in the United States. Among these, we identified 2,156 patients undergoing nonemergent high-risk PCI treated with Impella (n = 1,447) or IABP (n = 709). After propensity adjustment, Impella use was associated with improved survival (odds ratio [OR] 1.55, 95% confidence interval [CI] 1.02 to 2.36) and less MI (OR 0.29, 95% CI 0.18 to 0.46) and cardiogenic shock (OR 0.54, 95% CI 0.39 to 0.74). Stroke, bleeding requiring transfusion, and acute kidney injury were similar between groups. In conclusion, this Premier Healthcare Database propensity-adjusted analysis, Impella use during nonemergent high-risk PCI was associated with improved survival and reduced in-hospital MI and cardiogenic shock compared with IABP.",

        "Published":"2022-09-15",
        "Abstract":"OBJECTIVE: Statins are considered standard-of-care medical therapy for patients undergoing lower extremity bypass (LEB) procedures for chronic limb-threatening ischemia (CLTI). It is unclear, however, whether up-titrating and maintaining patients on higher-intensity statin medications following LEB improves limb salvage outcomes. This study was designed to evaluate whether high-intensity statin therapy impacts the risk of amputation and reintervention following LEB for patients with CLTI.\nMETHODS: The IBM MarketScan database was used to identify adult patients (18-99 years old) who underwent a LEB for CLTI between 2008 and 2017. Patients lacking insurance covering drug reimbursement or those who already had undergone amputation before time of bypass were excluded. Using pharmacy claims and national drug codes to define statin intensity, patients were stratified into three groups: high-intensity, low-intensity, and limited statin therapy. The association between intensity of statin therapy and need for reintervention and\/or major amputation after LEB was analyzed using Kaplan-Meier curves and risk-adjusted Cox proportional hazard models.\nRESULTS: A total of 25,907 patients who underwent LEB for CLTI were identified, of which 6696 (26%) were maintained on high-dose statins, 9297 (36%) were on low-dose statins, and 9914 (38%) had inconsistent pharmacy claims for statin therapy after surgery. Patients on high-intensity statins were, on average, younger and more likely to be male with comorbid disease (diabetes, hypertension, hyperlipidemia, obesity, renal insufficiency, ischemic heart disease, cerebrovascular disease, and tobacco abuse) than patients on low-intensity statins or limited statin therapy (P < .001 for all comparisons). Following LEB, 6649 patients (25.6%) required a reintervention, and 2550 patients (9.8%) went on to have a major amputation during follow-up. Patients maintained on high-intensity statins after LEB had a significantly lower likelihood of requiring a reintervention (hazard ratio [HR], 0.48; 95% confidence interval [CI], 0.45-0.51; P < .001) or amputation (HR, 0.27; 95% CI, 0.24-0.30; P < .001) as compared with patients on limited statin therapy. Further, there was a dose-dependent effect for these outcomes relative to patients on low-intensity statins in risk-adjusted models, and it was independent of whether an autologous vein graft was used for the LEB. Finally, among patients who underwent a reintervention, high-dose statin therapy also significantly reduced the HR for subsequent amputation (HR, 0.21; 95% CI, 0.18-0.25; P < .001).\nCONCLUSIONS: Patients with CLTI on high-intensity therapy following LEB had a significantly lower risk of requiring subsequent reintervention and amputation when compared with patients on low-intensity statins or with limited statin use. These data suggest that patients with CLTI should be up-titrated and\/or maintained on high-intensity statins following revascularization whenever possible.",

A total of 103 patients with ASC II A-C femoropopliteal ASO, who received treatment in our hospital from March 2020 to March 2021, were retrospectively selected and divided into the DCB group ( = 56) and BMS group ( = 47), according to treatment methods. The general clinical data and surgical results were compared between the two groups. The patients were followed up, and the primary patency rate, restenosis rate, freedom from target lesion revascularization (f-TLR), and limb preservation rate were recorded. The liver and kidney functions before and after operation and the occurrence of major postoperative adverse events were recorded. The operation was successful in both groups. The minimum diameter of the DCB group was smaller than that of the BMS group after treatment ( < 0.05). At 6 and 12 months after operation, the Rutherford classification decreased and ABI index increased in both groups ( < 0.05), but there was no significant difference ( > 0.05). At 6 and 12 months after surgery, f-TLR was significantly higher in the DCB group than in the BMS group ( < 0.05); at 12 months after surgery, the restenosis rate was lower in the DCB group than in the BMS group ( < 0.05). There was no significant difference in the primary patency rate and limb preservation rate at 6 and 12 months after operation between the two groups ( > 0.05). Before and after operation, there was no significant difference in liver and kidney function between the two groups ( > 0.05). Within 12 months after surgery, 1 patient in the DCB group developed puncture site hematoma 3 days after surgery, and 1 patient in the BMS group developed acute thrombosis 1 day after surgery, and no intervention-related deaths occurred. Domestic paclitaxel DCB can achieve better f-TLR and lower restenosis rate than BMS in the treatment of type II A-C femoral-popliteal artery ASO.

        "Published":"2022-05-30",
        "Abstract":"BACKGROUND: Potential complications of pelvic flow disruption during aortic aneurysm repair include buttock ischemia and mesenteric ischemia. Unilateral or bilateral hypogastric artery flow interruption, either from atherosclerosis or intentionally to facilitate aneurysm repair, is considered problematic in endovascular repair; however, it has not been well studied in open abdominal aortic aneurysm (AAA) repair (OAR). We sought to examine the effect of interruption of flow to one or both hypogastric arteries on outcomes after OAR.\nMETHODS: The Society for Vascular Surgery Quality Initiative database was queried for all patients undergoing elective open AAA repair between 2003 and 2020. (redundant) Patients with appropriate data on their hypogastric arteries postoperatively were stratified into two groups-patent bilaterally (normal pelvic perfusion, NPP) and unilateral or bilateral occlusion or ligation (compromised pelvic perfusion, CPP). Primary endpoints were 30-day major morbidity (myocardial infarction, respiratory complications, renal injury, and lower extremity or intestinal ischemia) and mortality.\nRESULTS: During the study period, 9.492 patients underwent elective open AAA repair-860 (9.1%) with compromised pelvic perfusion and 8,632 (90.9%) with patent bilateral hypogastric arteries. The groups had similar cardiac risk factors, including a history of coronary artery disease, prior coronary intervention, and the use of P2Y12 inhibitors and statins. A majority of patients in the CPP cohort had concurrent iliac aneurysms (63.3% vs. 24.8%; P < 0.001). The perioperative mortality was significantly higher in patients with compromised pelvic perfusion (5.5% vs. 3.1%; P < 0.001). Bilateral flow interruption had a trend toward higher perioperative mortality compared to unilateral interruption (7.1% vs. 4.7%; P < 0.147). The CPP group also had increased rates of myocardial injury (6.7% vs. 4.7%; P = 0.012), renal complications (18.9% vs. 15.9%; P = 0.024), leg and bowel ischemia (3.5% vs. 2.1%; P = 0.008; and 5.7% vs. 3.4%; P < 0.001, respectively). On multivariable analysis, CPP was associated with increased perioperative mortality (OR 1.47, CI 1.14-1.88, P = 0.003). On Kaplan-Meier analysis, there was no difference in survival at 2 years postdischarge between the NPP and CPP cohorts (86.1% vs. 87.5%, log-rank P = 0.275).\nCONCLUSIONS: Compromised pelvic perfusion is associated with increased perioperative complications and higher mortality in patients undergoing OAR. The sequelae of losing pelvic perfusion, in addition to the presence of more complex atherosclerotic and aneurysmal disease resulting in more difficult dissection, likely contribute to these findings. Thus, patients considered for OAR who have occluded hypogastric arteries or aneurysmal involvement of the hypogastric artery preoperatively may be candidates for more conservative management beyond traditional size criteria.",

Target vessel revascularization (adjusted-HR:1.37, 95%-CI:1.04-1.80, p = 0.026), death (adjusted-HR:1.52, 95%-CI:1.17-1.99, p = 0.002), and major adverse cardiovascular event risks (adjusted-HR:1.36, 95%-CI:1.13-1.64, p = 0.001) were also substantially higher.\nCONCLUSIONS: A history of symptomatic PAD still allows to simply identify patients with increased risk of unfavorable clinical outcome after PCI, including a higher risk of repeated coronary revascularization, despite using contemporary stents. In clinical practice, this knowledge about higher event risks of PAD patients is helpful both during Heart Team discussions and when informing patients about the procedural risk.",

        "Abstract":"['2', '2', '2', '2']\nThe optimal antiplatelet therapy of patients with non-ST-segment elevation acute coronary syndromes (NSTE-ACS) and chronic kidney disease (CKD) remains unknown. This study included 2,364 patients with NSTE-ACS undergoing predominantly percutaneous coronary intervention (PCI), who were randomized to ticagrelor or prasugrel in the ISAR-REACT 5 trial. Estimated glomerular filtration rate (eGFR) was calculated using the Chronic Kidney Disease Epidemiology Collaboration equation. The primary end point was 1-year mortality. Overall, there were 85 deaths (3.6%): 6 deaths (17.1%) in patients with eGFR <30, 31 deaths (6.9%) in patients with eGFR 30 to <60, 34 deaths (3.0%) in patients with eGFR 60 to <90, and 14 deaths (2.0%) in patients with eGFR ≥90 ml\/min\/1.73 m; adjusted hazard ratio (HR)=1.15, 95% confidence interval (CI) 1.01 to 1.31; p = 0.033 for 10 ml\/min\/1.73 m decrement in the eGFR. Bleeding occurred in 129 patients (5.5%): 7 bleeds (20.2%) in patients with eGFR <30, 36 bleeds (8.0%) in patients with eGFR 30 to <60, 64 bleeds (5.6%) in patients with eGFR 60 to <90, and 22 bleeds (3.1%) in patients with eGFR ≥90 ml\/min\/1.73 m; adjusted HR=1.11 (1.01 to 1.23); p = 0.045 for 10 ml\/min\/1.73 m decrement in the eGFR. One-year mortality and bleeding did not differ significantly between ticagrelor and prasugrel in all categories of impaired renal function. In conclusion, in patients with NSTE-ACS undergoing PCI with drug-eluting stents and third-generation antiplatelet drugs, impaired renal function was independently associated with higher risk of 1-year mortality and bleeding. The ischemic and bleeding risks appear to differ little between ticagrelor and prasugrel in all categories of impaired renal function.",

The aim of this study was to accurately and explicably predict, based on the first laboratory measurements, medications, and demographic information, the risk of death in patients with hypertensive chronic kidney disease within 1 and 3 years after admission to the Intensive Care Unit (ICU).\nMETHODS: Patients with hypertensive chronic kidney disease who had been registered in the Medical Information Mart for Intensive Care (MIMIC-III) database of critical care medicine were set as the subject of study, which was randomly divided into a training set and a validation set in a ratio of 7 : 3. Univariate Cox regression analysis and stepwise Cox regression analysis were applied in the training set to identify the predictive factors of prognosis of patients with hypertensive chronic kidney disease in ICU, and the predictive nomogram based on Cox regression model was constructed. We internally validated the model in the training set and externally validated that in the validation model. The efficacy was assessed primarily through area under the receiver operating characteristic (ROC) curve, clinical decision curves, and calibration curves.\nRESULTS: A total of 1762 patients with hypertensive chronic kidney disease were finally included. During the 3-year follow-up, 667 patients (37.85%) died, with a median follow-up time of 220 days (1-1090). The data set were randomly divided into a training set ( = 1231) and a validation set ( = 531). It was identified in the training set that insurance, albumin, alkaline phosphatase, the mean corpuscular hemoglobin concentration, mean corpuscular volume, history of coronary angiogram, hyperlipemia, medication of digoxin, acute renal failure, and history of renal surgery were the most relevant features. Taking 1 year and 3 years as the cut-off points, the AUC of participants were 0.736 and 0.744, respectively, in the internal validation and were 0.775 and 0.769, respectively, in the external validation, suggesting that the model is of favorable predictive efficacy.\nCONCLUSION: We trained and validated a model using data from a large multicenter cohort, which has considerable predictive performance on an individual scale and could be used to improve treatment strategies.",

        "Abstract":"Contrast-induced nephropathy (CIN) is a common complication with adverse outcome after iodinated-contrast injection, yet still lacking effective medication. Heme oxygenase-1 (HO-1) has been reported to play an important role against renal injuries. Hemin, a HO-1 inducer and anti-porphyria medicine, may have a promising effect against CIN. In this study, we aim to investigate the effect of hemin on CIN model and the underlying molecular mechanisms in human proximal tubule epithelial cells (HK-2). To mimic a common condition in percutaneous coronary intervention (PCI) patients, CIN was induced by intravenous iopromide in high-fat fed diabetic rats. We found hemin, given right before iopromide, mitigated CIN with enhanced antioxidative capacity and reduced oxidative stress. HK-2 cells insulted by iopromide demonstrated decreased cell vitality and rising reactive oxygen species (ROS), which could also be inhibited by hemin. The effects of hemin involved a key molecule in ferroptosis, glutathione peroxidase (GPX4), whose down-expression by small interfering RNA (siRNA) reversed the effect of hemin on HK-2 cells. Furthermore, hemin's induction of GPX4 involved HO-1 and nuclear factor erythroid 2-related factor 2 (Nrf2). Either HO-1 or Nrf2 inhibitor prevented hemin's effect on GPX4 to a comparable extent, and over-expression of Nrf2 increased GPX4 expression. Moreover, intervention of ferroptosis inhibitor liproxstatin-1 also alleviated CIN in vivo. Therefore, we showed hemin mitigated CIN, inhibiting oxidative stress and ferroptosis, by upregulation of GPX4 via activation of HO-1\/Nrf2. Hemin, as a clinical medicine, has a translational significance in treating CIN, and anti-ferroptosis is a potential therapeutic strategy for CIN.",

Patients in the DCA group were younger and had fewer comorbidities such as hypertension, diabetes mellitus, and chronic kidney disease than patients in the non-DCA group. Stentless PCI using the DCA with drug-coated balloon angioplasty was a preferred treatment strategy in the DCA group (50.0%). Predefined in-hospital adverse outcomes, including mortality (0.2% vs. 0.3%, p = 0.446) and periprocedural complications (1.8% vs. 1.7%, p = 0.697), were comparable between the two groups, whereas the fluoroscopy time was longer and the total contrast volume was higher in the DCA group.\nCONCLUSIONS: In Japan, PCI using the revived DCA catheter is safely performed with low complication rates in patients with stable coronary artery disease or unstable angina.",

        "Published":"2022-05-09",
        "Abstract":"BACKGROUND: Animal and human data suggest that glutamate can enhance recovery of myocardial metabolism and function after ischemia. N-terminal pro-brain natriuretic peptide (NT-proBNP) reflects myocardial dysfunction after coronary artery bypass surgery (CABG). We investigated whether glutamate infusion can reduce rises of NT-proBNP in moderate- to high-risk patients after CABG.\nMETHODS AND FINDINGS: A prospective, randomized, double-blind study enrolled patients from November 15, 2015 to September 30, 2020, with a 30-day follow-up at 4 academic cardiac surgery centers in Sweden. Patients underwent CABG ± valve procedure and had left ventricular ejection fraction ≤0.30 or EuroSCORE II ≥3.0. Intravenous infusion of 0.125 M L-glutamic acid or saline at 1.65 mL\/kg\/h started 10 to 20 minutes before releasing the aortic cross-clamp, then continued for another 150 minutes. Patients, staff, and investigators were blinded to the treatment. The primary endpoint was the difference between preoperative and day-3 postoperative NT-proBNP levels. Analysis was intention to treat. We studied 303 patients (age 74 ± 7 years; females 26%, diabetes 47%), 148 receiving glutamate group and 155 controls. There was no significant difference in the primary endpoint associated with glutamate administration (5,390 ± 5,396 ng\/L versus 6,452 ± 5,215 ng\/L; p = 0.086). One patient died ≤30 days in the glutamate group compared to 6 controls (0.7% versus 3.9%; p = 0.12). No adverse events linked to glutamate were observed. A significant interaction between glutamate and diabetes was found (p = 0.03). Among patients without diabetes the primary endpoint (mean 4,503 ± 4,846 ng\/L versus 6,824 ± 5,671 ng\/L; p = 0.007), and the incidence of acute kidney injury (11% versus 29%; p = 0.005) was reduced in the glutamate group. These associations remained significant after adjusting for differences in baseline data. The main limitations of the study are: (i) it relies on a surrogate marker for heart failure; and (ii) the proportion of patients with diabetes had almost doubled compared to the cohort used for the sample size estimation.\nCONCLUSIONS: Infusion of glutamate did not significantly reduce postoperative rises of NT-proBNP. Diverging results in patients with and without diabetes agree with previous observations and suggest that the concept of enhancing postischemic myocardial recovery with glutamate merits further evaluation.\nTRIAL REGISTRATION: ClinicalTrials.gov https:\/\/clinicaltrials.gov\/ct2\/show\/NCT02592824.

The baseline characteristics and clinical outcomes were compared between the CABG and PCI groups for each matched pair of patients with CKD. The primary endpoint was the occurrence of all-cause death. The secondary endpoints were major adverse cardiovascular events (MACCEs) such as death, myocardial infarction (MI), stroke, and repeat revascularization.\nRESULTS: A total of 1,485 patients underwent revascularization, such as 533 CABG and 952 patients with PCI. The median follow-up duration was 55.6 months (interquartile range 34.3-74.7 months). Multivariable Cox regression models were used for risk adjustment, and after propensity score matching (PSM), 399 patients were well matched in each group. The in-hospital mortality rate in the CABG group was higher than that in the PCI group, but the difference was not statistically significant (5.0 vs. 2.5%,  = 0.063). At the 1-year follow-up, CABG was associated with a lower survival rate than PCI (94.2 vs. 98.0%, hazard ratio [] of 3.72, 95%  = 1.63-8.49,  < 0.01). At the end of the 5-year follow-up, the freedom from MI and the freedom from repeated revascularization were both better in the CABG group compared to the PCI group (89.1 vs. 81.7%, HR of 0.59, 95%  = 0.38-0.92,  = 0.019; 86.9 vs. 73.8%,  of 0.54, 95%  = 0.36-0.81,  = 0.003, respectively).

CABG had a higher cumulative survival rate (68.4 vs. 66.0%) but without a statistically significant difference ( of 0.92, 95%  = 0.67-1.27,  = 0.602) compared with that of PCI.\nCONCLUSIONS: Compared to the use of PCI with a drug-eluting stent among patients with CKD, the use of CABG was associated with a lower MI rate, repeat revascularization rate, and lower number of MACCEs during the long-term follow-up. At a follow-up of 1 year, the number of MACCEs and other adverse events were comparable between the two cohorts, but CABG showed a lower survival rate than PCI.",

Advanced CKD was defined as glomerular filtration rate < 45 ml\/min.\nRESULTS: Of 9605 STEMI-patients, 1018 (10.6%) had advanced CKD with a serum creatinine of 2.22 ± 4.2 mg\/dl at admission and with lower rates of primary percutaneous coronary intervention (pPCI) (84.1 vs. 94.1%, p < 0.01) and higher all-cause-mortality (44.4 vs. 3.6%, p < 0.01). Over time, advanced CKD-patients were more likely to be treated with pPCI (2015-2019: 90.3% vs. 2006-2010:75.8%, p < 0.01) and with ticagrelor\/prasugrel (59.6% vs. 1.7%, p < 0.01) and drug eluting stents (90.7% vs. 1.3%, p < 0.01).

Both, ticagrelor\/prasugrel (OR 0.48, 95% CI 0.2-0.98) and DES (OR 0.38, 95% CI 0.2-0.8) were associated with a decrease in ischemic events at 1 year.\nCONCLUSIONS: During the observed time period STEMI-patients with advanced CKD were more likely to be treated with primary PCI, ticagrelor or prasugrel and DE-stents. These changes probably have contributed to the decline in ischemic events and the increase in bleedings within 1 year after STEMI while overall mortality at 1-year remained unchanged for this high-risk patient group.",

        "Abstract":"Acute kidney injury (AKI) is a common complication in patients with potentially life-threatening diseases, and it is also usually associated with unacceptable morbidity and mortality rates. Therefore, new and efficient therapies are urgently required to relieve AKI. It is well known that, reactive oxygen species (ROS), the NF-κB signaling pathways and pyroptosis are involved in AKI induced by ischemia\/reperfusion (I\/R). The present study seeks to further confirm the internal relationship between vitamin D deficiency and I\/R-induced AKI in patients, and to explore the underlying mechanisms of ROS, NF-κB signaling pathways and pyroptosis in the renal ischemia-reperfusion injury, as well as investigating the protective role of cholecalciferol. Patients with vitamin D deficiency show worse renal function reflected by postoperative glomerular filtration rate (GFR) and more release of proinflammatory cytokine IL-1β and IL-18. Renal cell injury and renal dysfunction induced by I\/R surgery were attenuated in the ICR mice administered with cholecalciferol. Cholecalciferol reduced ROS production, suppressed activated NF-κB signaling, and inhibited gasdermin D (GSDMD, a pyroptosis execution protein)-mediated pyroptosis. Cholecalciferol therefore has potential, as a clinical drug, to protect renal function in I\/R-induced AKI through reducing ROS production, NF-κB activation and GSDMD-mediated pyroptosis.",

The incidence of the primary endpoint of Bleeding Academic Research Consortium (BARC) type 2, 3, or 5 bleeding did not differ according to DM\/CKD status (P-trend = 0.13), but there was a significant increase in BARC 3 or 5 bleeding (P-trend &lt; 0.001) as well as the key secondary endpoint of death, myocardial infarction, or stroke (P-trend &lt; 0.001). Ticagrelor plus placebo reduced bleeding events compared with ticagrelor plus aspirin across all four groups, including DM+\/CKD+ patients with respect to BARC 2-5 [4.5% vs. 8.7%; hazard ratio (HR) 0.49, 95% confidence interval (CI) 0.24-1.01] as well as BARC 3-5 (0.8% vs. 5.3%; HR 0.15, 95% CI 0.03-0.53) bleeding, with no evidence of heterogeneity. The risk of death, myocardial infarction, or stroke was similar between treatment arms across all groups.\nCONCLUSION: Irrespective of the presence of DM, CKD, and their combination, ticagrelor monotherapy reduced the risk of bleeding without a significant increase in ischaemic events compared with ticagrelor plus aspirin.",

CA-AKI was defined as a post-PCI increase in serum creatinine of >0.5 mg\/dL or a relative increase of ≥25% compared with pre-PCI. CKD was defined as estimated glomerular filtration rate <60 mL\/min\/1.73 m. The primary endpoint was the 2-year rate of net adverse clinical events (NACE): All-cause mortality, myocardial infarction (MI), definite or probable stent thrombosis, or major bleeding.\nRESULTS: Of 7287 (85%) patients with evaluable data, 476 (6.5%) developed CA-AKI. In a multivariable model, older age, female sex, Caucasian race, congestive heart failure, diabetes, hypertension, CKD, presentation with ST-segment elevation MI, Killip class II to IV, radial access, intra-aortic balloon pump use, hypotension, and number of stents were independent predictors of CA-AKI. The 2-year NACE rate was higher in patients with CA-AKI (adjusted HR: 1.88; 95% CI: 1.42-2.49), as was each component of NACE (all-cause mortality, HR: 1.77; 95% CI: 1.22-2.55; MI, HR: 1.67; 95% CI: 1.18-2.36; definite\/probable stent thrombosis, HR: 1.71; 95% CI: 1.10-2.65; and major bleeding, HR: 1.38; 95% CI: 1.06-1.80).

However, the impact of stent types on in-hospital outcomes of patients with malignancy is largely unknown.\nMETHODS: Patients with concomitant diagnosis of cancer undergoing PCI between January 2005 and December 2014 were identified in the National Inpatient Sample. They were then categorized into those who have undergone coronary stenting with bare-metal stent (BMS) or drug-eluting stent (DES). Primary outcomes were in-hospital mortality and stent thrombosis.

Following propensity matching, 4313 patients were randomly selected in both groups using a 1:1 ratio. There was high use of BMS stent in cancer patient (BMS 43.0%, DES 57.0%) compared to general population (BMS 23.2%, DES 76.8%). When comparing BMS to DES group, there was no statistically significant difference in mortality (4.7% vs. 3.8%, p = 0.097), acute kidney injury (11.3% vs. 10.6%, p = 0.425), bleeding complications (3.50% vs. 3.45%, p = 0.914), and length of hospital stay (5.4% vs. 5.2%, p = 0.119).

This study aimed to assess the association between coronary artery calcification and chronic kidney disease severity on clinical outcomes after PCI. We identified 1,391 patients treated with drug-eluting stent for unprotected left main distal bifurcation lesions (ULMD), including 604 without calcified lesions (noncalcified left main group) and 787 with calcified ULMD (calcified left main group) in Japan and Italy. We divided the calcified group into the following 2 groups: estimated glomerular filtration rate (eGFR) ≥30 (n = 687) and <30 (n = 100) and compared the clinical outcomes. The primary end point was target lesion failure (TLF) at 3 years. TLF was defined as a composite of cardiac death, target lesion revascularization, and myocardial infarction. TLF occurred more frequently in the calcified group (adjusted hazard ratio 1.36, 95% confidence interval 1.08 to 1.71, p = 0.01), especially in calcified ULMD with eGFR <30 (adjusted hazard ratio relative to the other 2 groups 2.59, 95% confidence interval 1.60 to 4.18, p <0.001).

        "Abstract":"In this real-world, retrospective cohort study of 9753 patients in Japan prescribed dual antiplatelet therapy (DAPT) following percutaneous coronary intervention (PCI), we investigated DAPT duration and determined factors associated with early DAPT discontinuation and with event rates in patients who discontinued DAPT. The study period was April 1, 2012-March 31, 2018; endpoints comprised composite efficacy [death, myocardial infarction (MI), and stroke] and bleeding (intracranial, gastrointestinal, and requiring transfusion) endpoints. Overall, 68.8% of patients were continuing DAPT at 3 months post-PCI. Patients without major efficacy or safety events within 3 months after index PCI were included in a landmark analysis set (LAS; n = 7056), and categorized as DAPT ≥ 3 months (continuation) versus < 3 months (discontinuation). In the two LAS analysis groups, there was no difference in the composite bleeding endpoint (P = 0.067), although the incidence of the composite efficacy endpoint was higher in the discontinuation group (P < 0.001). In multivariate regression analysis, age ≥ 75 years, minor bleeding after PCI, history of cerebral infarction, history of cerebral or gastrointestinal bleeding, atrial fibrillation, dialysis, and anticoagulant use after PCI were associated with early DAPT discontinuation. Acute coronary syndrome, history of MI, kidney disorder, and anticoagulant use after PCI were associated with the composite efficacy endpoint in the discontinuation group. In conclusion, early DAPT discontinuation is more likely in patients at high bleeding risk, but may influence the occurrence of ischemic events in these patients. Determination of DAPT duration should take into account potential ischemic risk, even in patients at high bleeding risk.",

The aim of the present study was to assess, if intravenous (IV) Interferon (IFN) beta-1a improve survival after surgery by up-regulating Cluster of differentiation (CD73). This is a multi-center phase II double-blind, 2:1 randomized, parallel group comparison of the efficacy and safety of IV IFN beta-1a vs. placebo for the prevention of death after open surgery for an infra-renal RAAA. All study patients presented a confirmed infra-renal RAAA, survived the primary emergency surgery and were treated with IFN beta-1a (10 μg) or matching placebo for 6 days after surgery. Major exclusion criteria included fatal hemorrhagic shock, chronic renal replacement therapy, diagnosed liver cirrhosis, severe congestive heart failure, advanced malignant disease, primary attempt of endovascular aortic repair (EVAR), and per-operative suprarenal clamping over 30 min. Main outcome measure was all-cause mortality at day 30 (D30) from initial emergency aortic reconstruction. The study was pre-maturely stopped due to a reported drug-drug interaction and was left under-powered. Out of 40 randomized patients 38 were included in the outcome analyses (27 IFN beta-1a and 11 placebo). There was no statistically significant difference between treatment groups at baseline except more open-abdomen and intestinal ischemia was present in the IFN beta-1a arm. D30 all-cause mortality was 22.2% (6\/27) in the IFN beta-1a arm and 18.2% (2\/11) in the placebo arm (OR 1.30; 95% CI 0.21-8.19). The most common adverse event relating to the IFN beta-1a was pyrexia (20.7% in the IFN beta-1a arm vs. 9.1% in the placebo arm). Patients with high level of serum CD73 associated with survival (P = 0.001) whereas the use of glucocorticoids and the presence of IFN beta-1a neutralizing antibodies associated with a poor CD73 response and survival. The initial aim of the trial, if postoperative INF beta-1a treatment results on better RAAA survival, could not be demonstrated. Nonetheless the anticipated target mechanism up-regulation of CD73 was associated with 100% survival. According to present results the INF beta-1a induced up-regulation of serum CD73 was blocked with both use of glucocorticoids and serum IFN beta-1a neutralizing antibodies. The study was pre-maturely stopped due to interim analysis after a study concerning the use if IV IFN beta-1a in ARDS suggested that the concomitant use of glucocorticoids and IFN beta-1a block the CD73 induction.

The aim of this study was to examine factors affecting the post-PTA arteriovenous access (AVA) patency in patients who have been on close VA monitoring and surveillance for access flow.\nDESIGN: Retrospective cohort study.\nSETTING: A single medical centre in Taiwan.\nPARTICIPANTS: Records of patients who received chronic haemodialysis between 1 January 2017 and 31 December 2018 were retrospectively reviewed. Patients were divided into two groups (without or with PTA intervention on AVA).\nPRIMARY AND SECONDARY OUTCOME: Patients were followed until reintervention PTA, termination or abandoned VA or end of study. In addition to routine monitoring, VA flow surveillance was performed every 3 months for detection of VA dysfunction adhering to Kidney Disease Outcomes Quality Initiative guidelines.\nRESULTS: A total of 508 patients were selected for study inclusion (with PTA, n=231; without PTA, n=277). At baseline, variables that differed between groups included malignancy and levels of albumin, uric acid, potassium, phosphorous, high-density lipoprotein, total bilirubin and ferritin (all p<0.05). Significant between-group differences were observed for β-adrenergic blocking agents (with PTA, 49.8%; without PTA, 37.5%; p, 0.007) and ADP inhibitors (with PTA, 23.8%; without PTA, 11.2%; p<0.001).

        "Published":"2022-01-24",
        "Abstract":"INTRODUCTION: The interindividual variability of the antiplatelet effect of clopidogrel is determined by multiple clinical and genetic factors. A lot of genotype-oriented studies have concentrated on the impact of CYP2C19 gene polymorphisms on platelet aggregation in patients receiving clopidogrel. However, the influence of this polymorphism may be only 12-20%, so other genetic markers should also be investigated. The aim of this work was to study the impact of carriage of CES1, PON1, ABCG2, CYP4F2, CYP3A4, IGTB3, P2Y12, PEAR1, and B4GALT2 polymorphisms on antiplatelet effect of clopidogrel and clinical outcomes in patients with acute coronary syndrome (ACS) and atrial fibrillation (AF).\nMETHODS: 103 patients who underwent ACS with or without percutaneous coronary intervention and concomitant nonvalvular AF were included in an open multicenter prospective study to assess efficacy and safety of combined antithrombotic therapy. The study assessed the frequency of different primary clinical outcomes (incidence of major bleeding, hospital mortality, cardiovascular mortality, stroke and transient ischemic attacks (TIAs), renal mortality) and secondary outcomes (resistance to therapy - high residual platelet reactivity, excessive platelet suppression). Residual platelet reactivity was examined using the VerifyNow system (Accumetrics, Latham, NY, USA).\nRESULTS: None of the studied genetic markers had no statistically significant effect on the antiaggregant response to clopidogrel in patients with ACS and AF. However, CYP4F2 C(Val433Met) T, PEAR1 rs41273215 C>T were statistically significantly associated with an increased frequency of bleeding on antithrombotic therapy. B4GALT2 rs1061781 was statistically significantly associated with increased frequency of strokes and TIA.\nCONCLUSION: In our study, we determined that carriers of CYP4F2 gene polymorphisms C(Val433Met)T, PEAR1 rs41273215 C>T (CT+TT) were associated with lower safety of antithrombotic therapy in patients with ACS and AF. And, the B4GALT2 rs1061781 gene polymorphism was associated with a greater risk of insufficient efficacy of the therapy. The data obtained in our study may improve the understanding of the effect of less studied genetic markers on the efficacy and safety of antithrombotic therapy in patients with ACS and AF.",

Cinacalcet is the most commonly used drug to treat such patients, but it has never been compared to surgery. The goal of this study is to compare the long-term outcomes and survival between cinacalcet and parathyroidectomy in the treatment of secondary hyperparathyroidism in hemodialysis patients.\nMETHODS: Adult patients on hemodialysis who were treated with cinacalcet or parathyroidectomy in the United States Renal Data System were included. Patients treated with surgery (n = 2023) were compared using 1:1 propensity score matching ratio to a cohort of patients treated with cinacalcet. A Cox regression analysis was conducted to compare the overall mortality.\nRESULTS: The propensity score matching successfully created two groups with similar demographics. Patients in the surgery group had a higher mean peak PTH level prior to therapy (2066.8 vs 1425.4, P < 0.001). No difference was observed in the development of new-onset coronary artery disease (7.7% vs 7.9%, P = 0.8) or cerebrovascular disease (7% vs 6.7%, P = 0.8). Surgical patients had a higher rate of pathologic fractures (27.8% vs 24.9%, P = 0.04).

The occurrence of major adverse cardiac events (MACE), defined as all-cause death, recurrent myocardial infarction (re-MI), any repeat coronary revascularization, and definite or probable stent thrombosis (ST), was evaluated.\nRESULTS: After multivariable-adjusted analysis, in the CKD group, the MACE (adjusted hazard ratio [aHR]: 1.365, p = 0.004), all-cause death (aHR: 1.503, p = 0.004), noncardiac death (non-CD; aHR: 1.960, p = 0.004), and all-cause death or MI rates (aHR: 1.458, p = 0.002) were significantly higher in the NSTEMI group than in the STEMI group. In the non-CKD group, the non-CD rate (aHR: 1.78, p = 0.006) was also higher in the NSTEMI group. The CD, re-MI, any repeat revascularization, and ST rates were similar between groups. In the CKD group, from 6 months to 2 years after the index procedure, all-cause death, non-CD, and all-cause death or MI rates were significantly higher in the NSTEMI group than in the STEMI group. These results may be related to the higher non-CD rate in the NSTEMI group.\nCONCLUSIONS: In the era of contemporary newer-generation DES, NSTEMI showed a relatively higher non-CD rate than STEMI in both CKD and non-CKD groups.",

        "Abstract":"In contrast to atherosclerotic acute myocardial infarction (AMI), conservative therapy is considered preferable in the acute management of spontaneous coronary artery dissection (SCAD) if clinically possible. The present study aimed to investigate factors associated with treatment strategy for SCAD. Women aged ≤60 years with AMI and SCAD were retrospectively identified in the Nationwide Readmissions Database 2010 to 2015 and were divided into revascularization and conservative therapy groups. The revascularization group (n = 1,273, 68.0%), compared with the conservative therapy group (n = 600, 32.0%), had ST-elevation AMI (STEMI) (anterior STEMI, 20.3% vs 10.5%; inferior STEMI, 25.1% vs 14.5%; p <0.001) and cardiogenic shock (10.8% vs 1.8%; p <0.001) more frequently. Multivariable logistic regression analysis demonstrated that anterior STEMI (vs non-STEMI, odds ratio 2.89 [95% confidence interval 2.08 to 4.00]), inferior STEMI (2.44 [1.85 to 3.21]), and cardiogenic shock (5.13 [2.68 to 9.80]) were strongly associated with revascularization. Other factors associated with revascularization were diabetes mellitus, dyslipidemia, smoking, renal failure, and pregnancy\/delivery-related conditions; whereas known fibromuscular dysplasia and admission to teaching hospitals were associated with conservative therapy. Propensity-score matched analyses (546 pairs) found no significant difference in in-hospital death, 30-day readmission, and recurrent AMI between the groups. In conclusion, STEMI presentation, hemodynamic instability, co-morbidities, and setting of treating hospital may affect treatment strategy in women with AMI and SCAD. Further efforts are required to understand which patients benefit most from revascularization over conservative therapy in the setting of SCAD causing AMI.",

It remains a leading cause of acute kidney injury and is therefore an important issue in trauma and renal transplant surgery. Various pharmaceutical agents have been used in an attempt to dampen the harmful effects of IRI but few have been shown to be useful clinically. Riluzole, Lidocaine and Lamotrigine have been demonstrated to show anti-ischaemic properties in other organs; however, their use has not been tested in the kidneys. We investigated Riluzole, Lidocaine and Lamotrigine for their preventive effects of renal IRI using a rat model.\nMETHODS: Winstar rats (n = 48) were divided into four groups (n = 12 per group)-three treatment groups and one control group. Riluzole, Lidocaine and Lamotrigine were given prior to renal ischemia only (IO) or IRI. The degree of ischemia was measured by glutathione levels and a TUNEL assay was used to measure DNA fragmentation.\nRESULTS: Riluzole, Lidocaine and Lamotrigine pre-treatment each resulted in statistically higher glutathione levels compared to controls (P = 0.002; P = 0.007 and P = 0.005, respectively). Riluzole and Lidocaine were also effective at preventing depletion of glutathione following IO (P = 0.007 and P = 0.014 respectively), while Lamotrigine was ineffective in IO (P = 0.71). The degree of DNA fragmentation seen on the TUNEL assay was markedly reduced in all three-drug groups in both IO and IRI.\nDISCUSSION: Riluzole, Lidocaine and Lamotrigine all have anti-ischaemic effects in the rat kidney and can have potential therapeutic implications.",

However, the intensity of evidence has been poor, limiting the further clinical application of XKS to patients above. This systematic review and meta-analysis will assess the effectiveness and safety of studies of XKS in CHD patients with anxiety and depression symptoms after PCI.\nMETHODS: A systematic literature search for articles up to December 2021 will be performed in following electronic databases: PubMed, Embase, the Cochrane Library, China National Knowledge Infrastructure, Chinese Scientific Journals Database Database, Chinese Biomedical Database, Chinese Biomedical Literature Service System, and Wanfang Database. Inclusion criteria are randomized controlled trials of XKS applied on patients with CHD and depression. The primary outcome measures will be CHD-related clinical evaluation (frequency of acute attack angina, severity of angina pectoris, electrocardiographic changes, amount of nitroglycerin) and the scores or reducing fractions of depressive and anxiety measuring scales (the Hospital Anxiety\/Depression Scale or other widely used anxiety\/depression scale). The safety outcome measures will be adverse events, liver and kidney function. RevMan 5.3 software will be used for data synthesis, sensitivity analysis, subgroup analysis, and risk of bias assessment. A funnel plot will be developed to evaluate reporting bias.

        "Published":"2021-11-08",
        "Abstract":"BACKGROUND: Traditionally, fluid administration during kidney transplant surgery is guided by central venous pressure (CVP) despite its limited reliability as a parameter for assessing intravascular fluid volume, particularly in patients with cardiovascular diseases. The recommended goals at graft reperfusion are a mean arterial pressure of 90 mm Hg and a CVP of 12-14 mm Hg. This approach may increase the risk of significant adverse effects due to volume overload. Perioperative fluid therapy guided by dynamic indices of fluid responsiveness has been shown to optimize intravascular volume and prevent complications associated with overzealous administration of fluids in major abdominal surgeries. We hypothesized that pulse pressure variation (PPV)-guided fluid administration would result in better optimization of intravascular fluid volume compared with a CVP-guided strategy during kidney transplant surgery.\nMETHODS: In this single-centre randomized double blinded trial, 77 end-stage renal disease patients, who underwent kidney transplant surgery under general anesthesia with epidural analgesia, were randomized to receive either CVP-guided (n = 35) or PPV-guided (n = 35) fluid therapy using predefined hemodynamic endpoints. The primary outcome was the total volume of intraoperative fluids administered. Secondary outcomes were intraoperative hemodynamic changes, serum lactate levels, serum creatinine, need for dialysis within the first week, creatinine elimination ratio, and incidence of immediate and delayed graft dysfunction.\nRESULTS: Results were analyzed for 70 patients. Eighty percent of the patients underwent living-related donor allograft kidney transplant. Operative variables related to donor characteristics, duration of surgery, graft cold ischemia time, and blood loss were comparable in both groups. The mean (standard deviation) volume of intravenous fluids administered intraoperatively was 1,346 (337) mL in the PPV-guided group vs 1,901 (379) mL in the CVP-guided group (difference in means, 556 mL; 95% confidence interval, 385 to 727; P = 0.001). There were no significant differences in secondary outcomes between the two groups.\nCONCLUSION: Pulse pressure variation -guided fluid administration significantly decreased the total volume of crystalloids compared with CVP-guided fluid therapy during the intraoperative period in patients who underwent kidney transplant surgery. Nevertheless, our study was underpowered to detect differences in secondary outcomes.\nTRIAL REGISTRATION: www.ctri.nic.in (CTRI\/2018\/01\/011638); registered 31 January 2018.",

        "Abstract":"BACKGROUND: Patients with ischaemic heart disease and previous coronary artery bypass grafting (CABG) often need coronary evaluation by means of invasive coronary angiography (ICA). ICA in such patients is technically more challenging and carries a higher risk of complications including kidney damage, myocardial infarction, stroke and death. Improvements in Computed Tomography Cardiac Angiography (CTCA) technology have ensured its emergence as a useful clinical tool in CABG assessment, allowing for its potential use in planning interventional procedures in this patient group.\nMETHODS: The BYPASS-CTCA study is a prospective, single centre, randomised controlled trial assessing the value of upfront CTCA in patients with previous surgical revascularisation undergoing ICA procedures. A total of 688 patients with previous CABG, requiring ICA for standard indications, will be recruited and randomised to receive ICA alone, or CTCA prior to angiography. Subjects will be followed up over a 12-month period post procedure. The primary endpoints are ICA procedural duration, incidence of contrast-induced nephropathy (CIN) and patient satisfaction scores post ICA. Secondary endpoints include contrast dose (mL) and radiation dose (mSv) during ICA, number of catheters used, angiography-related complications and cost-effectiveness of CTCA (QALY) over 12 months.\nDISCUSSION: The study will investigate the hypothesis that CTCA prior to ICA in patients with previous CABG can reduce procedural duration, post-procedural kidney damage and improve patient satisfaction, therefore strengthening its role in this group of patients.\nTRIAL REGISTRATION: The study is registered on ClinicalTrials.gov which is a resource maintained by the U.S. National Library of Medicine.

Whether pPCI confers a benefit to patients receiving dialysis that is similar to that which occurs in lower-risk groups remains unknown. We compared the effect of pPCI on in-hospital outcomes among patients hospitalized for ST-elevation myocardial infarction (STEMI) and receiving maintenance dialysis with the effect among patients hospitalized for STEMI but not receiving dialysis.\nSTUDY DESIGN: Retrospective cohort study.\nSETTING & PARTICIPANTS: We used the National Inpatient Sample (2016-2018) and included all adult hospitalizations with a primary diagnosis of STEMI.\nPREDICTORS: Primary exposure was PCI. Confounders included dialysis status, demographics, insurance, household income, comorbidities, and the elective nature of the admission.\nOUTCOME: In-hospital mortality, stroke, acute kidney injury, new dialysis requirement, vascular complications, gastrointestinal bleeding, blood transfusion, mechanical ventilation, palliative care, and discharge destination.\nANALYTICAL APPROACH: The average treatment effect (ATE) of pPCI was estimated using propensity score matching independently within the group receiving dialysis and the group not receiving dialysis to explore whether the effect is modified by dialysis status. Additionally, the average marginal effect (AME) was calculated accounting for the clustering within hospitals.\nRESULTS: Among hospitalizations, 4,220 (1.07%) out of 413,500 were for patients receiving dialysis. The dialysis cohort was older (65.2 ± 12.2 vs 63.4 ± 13.1, P < 0.001), had a higher proportion of women (42.4% vs 30.6%, P < 0.001) and more comorbidities, and had a lower proportion of White patients (41.1% vs 71.7%, P < 0.001). Patients receiving dialysis were less likely to undergo angiography (73.1% vs 85.4%, P < 0.001) or pPCI (57.5% vs 79.8%, P < 0.001).

Both the ATE and AME were comparable for other in-hospital outcomes in both groups.\nLIMITATIONS: Administrative data, lack of pharmacotherapy and long-term outcome data, and residual confounding.\nCONCLUSIONS: Compared with conservative management, pPCI for STEMI was associated with comparable reductions in short-term mortality among patients irrespective of their receipt of maintenance dialysis.",

        "Abstract":"INTRODUCTION: Thrombolysis has been suggested as a feasible method to treat arterial renal transplant thrombosis under conditions of short duration of ischemia. Data on maximal duration of ischemia that are still feasible to treat are scarce.\nMETHODS: We retrospectively analysed our experience involving three attempts to utilize thrombolysis to treat transplant renal artery thrombosis. We searched through literature on PubMed and compared the data we found with our own experience.\nRESULTS: In case number 1 of our cohort, thrombolysis was initiated 12 hours after the onset of thrombosis and had to be ceased after five hours due to the formation of a haematoma. Perfusion of the graft was restored but it did not regain function, most likely due to long ischemia time. In case number 2, an attempt to use thrombolysis was unsuccessful due to failure to cross the graft artery occlusion with a guidewire. Thrombosis was most likely caused by chronic rejection of the graft. In case number 3, thrombolysis restored arterial patency but, due to an onset of ischemia, which lasted 2 to 3 days, did not lead to restoration of graft function. The prolonged ischemia period in case three occurred, at least in part, due to failure to perform an ultrasound scan when the patient was first admitted.\nCONCLUSION: We can confirm that thrombolysis for transplant renal artery thrombosis seems to be feasible only when the condition has a short duration. In the event of sudden deterioration of graft function, the absence of perfusion must always be ruled out by ultrasound scan.",

However, large validation studies have been scarce and the discriminative ability for patients with a preexisting bleeding risk factor (elderly, underweight, women, anemia, kidney dysfunction, or cancer) in a real-world setting is unknown. Methods and Results Patients undergoing percutaneous coronary intervention for myocardial infarction between 2008 and 2017 were included from the SWEDEHEART (Swedish Web System for Enhancement of Evidence-Based Care in Heart Disease Evaluated According to Recommended Therapies) registry (n=66 295). The predictive value of the PRECISE-DAPT score for rehospitalization with major bleeding during dual antiplatelet therapy was evaluated using receiver operating characteristic analyses. A high PRECISE-DAPT score (≥25; n=13 894) was associated with increased risk of major bleeding (3.9% versus 1.8%; hazard ratio [HR], 2.2; 95% CI, 2.0-2.5; <0.001) compared with a non-high score (<25; n=52 401). The score demonstrated a c-statistic of 0.64 (95% CI, 0.63-0.66). The discriminative ability of the score to further stratify bleeding risk in patients with preexisting bleeding risk factors was poor, especially in patients who are elderly (c-statistic=0.57; 95% CI, 0.55-0.60) or underweight (c-statistic=0.56; 95% CI, 0.51-0.61), for whom a non-high PRECISE-DAPT score was associated with similar bleeding risk as a high PRECISE-DAPT score in the general myocardial infarction population. Conclusions In this nationwide population-based study, the PRECISE-DAPT score performed moderately in the general myocardial infarction population and poorly in patients with preexisting bleeding risk factors, where its usefulness seems limited.",

Independent factors related to initiation of and persistence with P2Y12 inhibitors were analysed by multivariable logistic regression and a Cox proportional hazards model. Patients were stratified by revascularization strategy: percutaneous coronary intervention (PCI), coronary artery bypass graft (CABG), or medical therapy alone (MTA). Overall, 79 597 MI patients were included with 39 172 undergoing PCI, 2619 CABG, and 16 640 MTA, showing initiation of P2Y12 inhibitors of 93.4%, 49.0%, and 51.5%, respectively. Congestive heart failure, cerebrovascular disease, cardiac dysrhythmias, renal failure, previous bleeding, and oral anticoagulants were associated with less initiation of P2Y12 inhibitors. Female sex was associated with less initiation of P2Y12 inhibitors following MTA. MTA, coronary angiography, cerebrovascular disease, diabetes with complications, previous bleeding, antidiabetics, and ticagrelor as P2Y12 inhibitor were associated with non-persistence, whereas female sex, advanced age, and concomitant pharmacotherapy with angiotensin-converting enzyme inhibitors, beta-blockers, statins, oral anticoagulants, and aspirin were associated with high persistence.\nCONCLUSION: Initiation of P2Y12 inhibitors in PCI-treated MI patients was high in contrast to those treated with CABG or MTA and patients with certain comorbidities. Further studies on the benefit-risk ratio of P2Y12 inhibitors in CABG-treated or MTA-treated patients and patients with comorbidities after first-time MI are warranted, as is focus on persistence among patients receiving MTA, patients with comorbidities, and users of ticagrelor.",

A total of 18,875 AMI patients were classified into group A (statin users,  = 16,055) and group B (statin nonusers,  = 2820). According to the baseline estimated glomerular filtration rate (eGFR; ≥90, 60-89, 30-59 and <30 mL\/min\/1.73 m), these two groups were sub-classified into groups A1, A2, A3 and A4 and groups B1, B2, B3 and B4.

        "Abstract":"BACKGROUND: Cancer is often associated with a hypercoagulable state and new thrombosis is often the first clinical manifestation of cancer. Surgical treatment of the primary tumor is crucial since it provides the only curative approach in most cases, but management of patients is highly complex, especially in the presence of new antiplatelet drugs and\/or anticoagulants. Paraneoplastic syndromes (PNS) represent a frequent complication of renal cell carcinomas (RCC) and include different hematological symptoms in patients, whilst occlusion of arterial blood vessels displays a rare form of PNS accompanying renal tumors.\nCASE PRESENTATION: We report the case of a 62-year old man who was initially hospitalized due to acute coronary syndrome. He subsequently underwent coronary angioplasty treatment including multiple stenting and treatment with ticagrelor and aspirin. Post-interventional, acute arterial thrombotic emboli of several limb arteries required thrombectomy. By computer tomography we identified a renal lesion suspicious for an RCC and suspected a PNS as underlying cause of the thrombotic complications. Triple anticoagulant therapy was maintained with therapeutic dose low molecular weight heparin (LMWH), aspirin, and clopidogrel, by which we replaced ticagrelor. Surgery was postponed for 4 weeks. We paused LMWH, aspirin and clopidogrel only at the day of surgery and perioperatively restored hemostasis by transfusion of two platelet concentrates. Laparoscopic nephrectomy was uneventful. Pathology confirmed a clear cell RCC. The patient fully recovered whilst slowly reducing anticoagulation dose.\nCONCLUSIONS: A multidisciplinary team approach of experts in urology, cardiology and hemostasis was key in managing this patient since a personalized thrombosis consult was needed to minimize the risk of reinfarction due to in-stent thrombosis. We report a therapeutic protocol that may be helpful for the management of similar cases. Furthermore, the finding of thrombotic arterial occlusions in larger blood vessels represents a novel complication of PNS in RCC and adds to the varied possible manifestations of this clinical chameleon.",

After 3 years, follow-up was extended to 5 years with the endpoints of target lesion failure and rate of definite or probable stent thrombosis.\nRESULTS: A total of 123 patients with 123 lesions were enrolled. Lesions were 12.6 ± 4.5 mm long and 2.7 ± 0.4 mm in diameter, 43.4% were class B2\/C lesions, and calcification was moderate to severe in 10.6%. At 5 years, 5.4% of patients had stable angina and 94.6% had no symptoms or ischaemia. Target lesion failure rate was 8.0% [95% confidence interval:4.2;14.9], reflecting 2 cardiac deaths, 2 target-vessel myocardial infarctions, and 6 clinically driven target lesion revascularizations (TLRs). Only one target lesion failure occurred beyond 3 years: a target-vessel myocardial infarction with clinically driven TLR on post-procedure day 1157. One additional non-cardiac death beyond 3 years due to renal failure was reported on day 1777. No definite or probable scaffold thrombosis was observed.\nCONCLUSION: The Magmaris scaffold showed favourable long-term safety and clinical performance with low target lesion failure rates and absence of definite or probable scaffold thrombosis throughout 5 years.",

        "Abstract":"BACKGROUND: Dual antiplatelet therapy (DAPT) is currently the standard treatment for the prevention of ischemic events after stent implantation. However, the optimal DAPT duration remains elusive for patients with chronic kidney disease (CKD). Therefore, we aimed to compare the effectiveness and safety between long-term and short-term DAPT after coronary stenting in patients with CKD.\nMETHODS: This retrospective cohort study analyze data from the Taipei Medical University (TMU) Institutional and Clinical Database, which include anonymized electronic health data of 3 million patients that visited TMU Hospital, Wan Fang Hospital, and Shuang Ho Hospital. We enrolled patients with CKD after coronary stenting between 2008 and 2019. The patients were divided into the long-term (>6 months) and short-term DAPT group (≤ 6 months). The primary end point was major adverse cardiovascular events (MACE) from 6 months after the index date. The secondary outcomes were all-cause mortality and Thrombolysis in Myocardial Infarction (TIMI) bleeding.\nRESULTS: A total of 1899 patients were enrolled; of them, 1112 and 787 were assigned to the long-term and short-term DAPT groups, respectively. Long-term DAPT was associated with similar risk of MACE (HR: 1.05, 95% CI: 0.65-1.70, P = 0.83) compare with short-term DAPT. Different CKD risk did not modify the risk of MACE. There was also no significant difference in all-cause mortality (HR: 1.10, 95% CI: 0.75-1.61, P = 0.63) and TIMI bleeding (HR 1.19, 95% CI: 0.86-1.63, P = 0.30) between groups.\nCONCLUSIONS: Among patients with CKD and coronary stenting, we found that long-term and short-term DAPT tied on the risk of MACE, all-cause mortality and TIMI bleeding.",

In the context of PCI performance assessment, there are limited data regarding the characteristics and outcomes of unsuccessful PCI.\nMETHOD: We prospectively collected data on patients undergoing single-lesion PCI between 2013 and 2017 who were enrolled in the multi-center Victorian Cardiac Outcomes Registry. Procedures were divided into two groups by whether or not PCI was deemed successful at the end of the procedure using a pre-specified definition.\nRESULTS: There were 34,383 single-lesion PCI performed, of which 18,644 (54.2%) were for acute coronary syndromes. Of the study cohort, 2080 patients (6.0%) had an unsuccessful PCI - these patients were older, more likely to have previous stroke, PCI, severe left ventricular dysfunction and chronic kidney disease (all p < 0.001). The procedure was also more likely to be performed for stable angina (p < 0.001). Chronic total occlusion PCI made up 31% of unsuccessful PCI cases. Unsuccessful PCI was itself associated with higher in-hospital and 30-day mortality and MACE (all p < 0.001). 4.9% of unsuccessful PCIs led to unplanned in-hospital bypass surgery (compared to 0.2% in successful PCIs, p < 0.001).\nCONCLUSION: Our study highlights that even in contemporary PCI practice, more than 1 in 20 PCI attempts are unsuccessful. Lack of procedural success has a strong influence on patient outcomes. Monitoring rates of unsuccessful cases is an important quality assurance tool.",

The aim of this study is to compare the different oral P2Y inhibitors in terms of efficacy and safety, focusing exclusively on patients with CKD who were treated for ACS.\nMETHODS: We systematically searched PubMed, CENTRAL, and Web of Science to identify studies that compared different oral P2Y inhibitors (clopidogrel, prasugrel, and ticagrelor) in patients with ACS with CKD. Efficacy outcomes included the major adverse cardiovascular events composite outcome and safety outcomes included major bleedings and major or minor bleedings combined. We performed a frequentist network meta-analysis.\nRESULTS: Twelve studies were included in the systematic review, 7 CKD subgroup analyses of RCTs (8878 patients) and 5 observational studies (20175 patients). After the exclusion of studies with conservative management, prasugrel resulted in significant primary endpoint reduction versus clopidogrel (HR 0.80 and 95% CI 0.64 - 0.99), while ticagrelor did not (HR 0.88 and 95% CI 0.73 - 1.06). Major bleedings did not differ between the interventions. Ticagrelor resulted in more major or minor bleedings than clopidogrel (HR 1.21 and 95% CI 1.06 - 1.38), whereas prasugrel did not (HR 1.12 and 95% CI 0.84 - 1.49).\nCONCLUSION: In patients with ACS with underlying CKD, who are intended to receive invasive management, there may be a significant reduction of the primary efficacy outcome with prasugrel as compared to clopidogrel but not with ticagrelor as compared to clopidogrel. There probably exists no difference among interventions in the major bleedings. Dedicated RCTs are needed to confirm these results.",

The present study aimed to compare the safety and efficacy of the Resolute Onyx 2.0 mm drug-eluting stent (DES) (Medtronic) with the Onyx 2.25 mm DES for the treatment of CAD.\nMETHODS: We retrospectively evaluated patients who underwent percutaneous coronary intervention (PCI) for CAD involving Onyx 2.0 mm DES (Onyx 2.0 group) and Onyx 2.25 mm DES (Onyx 2.25 group) in the 2 consecutive years from November 2016 to November 2018. Major adverse cardiac and cerebral event (MACCE) rate, defined as all-cause mortality, non-fatal myocardial infarction, stroke, and repeat revascularization for target-lesion failure, was reported.\nRESULTS: A total of 152 subjects with 160 lesions were enrolled. The baseline demographics, lesion characteristics, and procedural results between the two groups were similar. The lesions were significantly shorter (P<.01), fewer stents were consequently deployed (P=.04), and the total stent length was shorter (P<.01) in the Onyx 2.0 group vs the Onyx 2.25 group. At a median follow-up of 673 days, MACCE rate did not differ significantly between the two groups. Multivariate analysis identified the presence of atrial fibrillation, chronic kidney disease, and the use of statins to be independently associated with MACCE.\nCONCLUSIONS: Our data suggest that the use of the Onyx 2.0 mm DES to treat CAD in very small vessels (<2.25 mm) is feasible and safe, and the clinical outcomes were similar to those of the Onyx 2.25 mm group.",

Although there is a plethora of data on ISR, there is relatively less data on intra-stent-CTO. In this study, we explore the long-term clinical outcomes following angioplasty to intra-stent CTO and study the differences in clinical outcomes between three treatment-arms: POBA vs. DES vs. DCB.\nMETHODS AND RESULTS: We evaluated all patients who underwent PCI to intra-stent CTO between 2011 and 2017. The endpoints used were: cardiac-death, TVMI, TLR, TVR, and MACE.During the study period, 403-patients with a mean age of 69.2 years had successful PCI to intra-stent CTO. 50% were diabetic, 38% had CKD and 32% had left ventricular dysfunction. 93% of cases were stable angina. 22% (n = 88) received only POBA, 28% (n = 113) received DCB and 50% (n = 202) received DES. During the median follow-up of 48-months, cardiac-death occurred in 5.8% (n = 23), TVMI in 4% (n = 16), TLR in 45.6% (n = 182), TVR in 48.7% (n = 194) and MACE of 46%.

The sample was divided according to the presence or absence of CVD (myocardial infarction, angina, coronary revascularization, or surgery for calcified heart valves). Univariable and multivariable regression models, adjusted for age, sex, BMI, hypertension, diabetes, eGFR, plasma bicarbonate and potential renal acid load of foods were used to investigate differences across groups.\nRESULTS: 1826 patients had available data for 24-h urine analysis. Among these, 108 (5.9%) had a history of CVD. Those with CVD were older, have higher prevalence of hypertension and diabetes and lower eGFR. Univariable analysis showed that patients with CVD had significantly lower 24-h urinary excretions for citrate (2.4 vs 2.6 mmol\/24 h, p = 0.04), magnesium (3.9 vs 4.2 mmol\/24 h, p = 0.03) and urinary pH (6.1 vs 6.2, p = 0.02). After adjustment for confounders, differences in urinary citrate and magnesium excretions remained significant. No differences in the probability of stone formation or stone compositions were found.\nCONCLUSIONS: Stone formers with CVD have lower renal alkali excretion, possibly suggesting higher acid retention in stone formers with cardiovascular comorbidities.

        "Abstract":"INTRODUCTION: Sodium-glucose co-transporter-2 (SGLT-2) inhibitors have been shown to have beneficial effects on various cardiovascular (CV) outcomes in patients with type 2 diabetes (T2D) in primary prevention and in those with a high CV risk profile. However, the mechanism(s) responsible for these CV benefits remain elusive and unexplained. The aim of the DAPAHEART study will be to demonstrate that treatment with SGLT-2 inhibitors is associated with greater myocardial insulin sensitivity in patients with T2D, and to determine whether this improvement can be attributed to a decrease in whole-body (and tissue-specific) insulin resistance and to increased myocardial perfusion and\/or glucose uptake. We will also determine whether there is an appreciable degree of improvement in myocardial-wall conditions subtended by affected and non-affected coronary vessels, and if this relates to changes in left ventricular function.\nMETHODS: The DAPAHEART trial will be a phase III, single-center, randomized, two-arm, parallel-group, double-blind, placebo-controlled study. A cohort of 52 T2D patients with stable coronary artery disease (without any previous history of myocardial infarction, with or without previous percutaneous coronary intervention), with suboptimal glycemic control (glycated hemoglobin [HbA1c] 7-8.5%) on their current standard of care anti-hyperglycemic regimen, will be randomized in a 1:1 ratio to dapagliflozin or placebo. The primary outcome is to detect changes in myocardial glucose uptake from baseline to 4 weeks after treatment initiation. The main secondary outcome will be changes in myocardial blood flow, as measured by N-ammonia positron emission tomography\/computed tomography (PET\/CT). Other outcomes include cardiac function, glucose uptake in skeletal muscle, adipose tissue, liver, brain and kidney, as assessed by fluorodeoxyglucose (FDG) PET-CT imaging during hyperinsulinemic-euglycemic clamp; pericardial, subcutaneous and visceral fat, and browning as observed on CT images during FDG PET-CT studies; systemic insulin sensitivity, as assessed by hyperinsulinemic-euglycemic clamp, glycemic control, urinary glucose output; and microbiota modification.\nDISCUSSION: SGLT-2 inhibitors, in addition to their insulin-independent plasma glucose-lowering effect, are able to directly (substrate availability, fuel utilization, insulin sensitivity) as well as indirectly (cardiac after-load reduction, decreased risk factors for heart failure) affect myocardial functions. Our study will provide novel insights into how these drugs exert CV protection in a diabetic population.\nTRIAL REGISTRATION: EudraCT No. 2016-003614-27; ClinicalTrials.gov Identifier: NCT03313752.",

        "Abstract":"Direct oral anticoagulants (DOACs), apixaban, dabigatran, edoxaban, and rivaroxaban, are widely used for the prevention of stroke and systemic embolism in patients with non-valvular atrial fibrillation as well as for prevention and treatment of venous thromboembolism. Although DOACs do not require routine laboratory monitoring of anticoagulant effect, there are special situations in which laboratory assessment may be warranted. Laboratory tests include quantitative assays, which measure plasma DOAC levels, and qualitative or semi-quantitative assays, which may be used to screen for the presence of clinically relevant DOAC levels. Indications for laboratory assessment include emergent indications (serious bleeding, urgent surgery, acute ischemic stroke with consideration of thrombolysis) and elective indications (extremes of bodyweight, renal hypo- or hyperfunction, liver disease, suspected drug-drug interactions, suspected gastrointestinal malabsorption). In general, quantitative assays that measure DOAC levels may be used for elective indications, whereas screening assays may be necessary for emergent indications if a quantitative assay with sufficiently rapid turnaround time is not available. Therapeutic ranges for DOACs have not been defined. In lieu of therapeutic ranges, data from pharmacokinetic studies may be used to determine whether a patient's plasma DOAC level falls within the expected range. If it does not, a change in therapy may be warranted. Depending on the clinical scenario, a change in therapy may involve adjustment of the DOAC dose, a change to a different DOAC, or a change to a different class of anticoagulant.",

        "Abstract":"IMPORTANCE: Shortened dual antiplatelet therapy followed by potent P2Y12 receptor inhibitor monotherapy reduces bleeding without increasing ischemic events after percutaneous coronary intervention (PCI).\nOBJECTIVE: To explore sex differences and evaluate the association of sex with outcomes among patients treated with ticagrelor monotherapy vs ticagrelor plus aspirin.\nDESIGN, SETTING, AND PARTICIPANTS: This was a prespecified secondary analysis of TWILIGHT, an investigator-initiated, placebo-controlled randomized clinical trial conducted at 187 sites across 11 countries. Study participants included patients who underwent successful PCI with drug-eluting stents, were planned for discharge with ticagrelor plus aspirin, and who had at least 1 clinical and at least 1 angiographic feature associated with high risk of ischemic or bleeding events. Data were analyzed from May to July 2020.\nINTERVENTIONS: At 3 months after PCI, patients adherent to ticagrelor and aspirin without major adverse event were randomized to either aspirin or placebo for an additional 12 months along with ticagrelor.\nMAIN OUTCOMES AND MEASURES: The primary end point was Bleeding Academic Research Consortium (BARC) type 2, 3, or 5 bleeding at 12 months after randomization. The primary ischemic end point was a composite of death, myocardial infarction, or stroke.\nRESULTS: Of 9006 enrolled patients, 7119 underwent randomization (mean [SD] age, 63.9 [10.2] years; 5421 [76.1%] men). Women were older (mean [SD] age, 65.5 [9.6] years in women vs 63.4 [10.3] years in men) with higher prevalence of chronic kidney disease (347 women [21.2%] vs 764 men [14.7%]). The primary bleeding end point occurred more often in women than men (hazard ratio [HR], 1.32; 95% CI, 1.06-1.64; P = .01). After multivariate adjustment, incremental bleeding risk associated with female sex was no longer significant (adjusted HR, 1.20; 95% CI, 0.95-1.52; P = .12). Ischemic end points were similar between sexes. Ticagrelor plus placebo vs ticagrelor plus aspirin was associated with lower risk of BARC type 2, 3, or 5 bleeding in women (adjusted HR, 0.62; 95% CI, 0.42-0.92; P = .02) and men (adjusted HR, 0.57; 95% CI, 0.44-0.73; P < .001; P for interaction = .69). Ischemic end points were similar between treatment groups in both sexes.\nCONCLUSIONS AND RELEVANCE: These findings suggest that the higher bleeding risk in women compared with men was mostly attributable to baseline differences, whereas ischemic events were similar between sexes. In this high-risk PCI population, the benefits of early aspirin withdrawal with continuation of ticagrelor were generally comparable in women and men.\nTRIAL REGISTRATION: ClinicalTrials.gov Identifier: NCT02270242.",

        "Abstract":"Efficacy, safety and tolerability of lacosamide in the treatment of status epilepticus are well described. However, other evidence of its pharmacologic profile in elderly patients with other comorbidities seems warranted. We describe the case of an 80 year-old woman with an history of arterial hypertension, ischemic cardiomyopathy, COPD, CKD, previous laryngeal cancer, a stoma positioning for diverticular disease and previous surgery for a left frontal meningioma. Since then, the patient developed focal epilepsy and she was on levetiracetam and valproic acid therapy. The patient was admitted to our department for a focal status epilepticus characterized by non-fluent aphasia and right facio-brachial clonic movements. She also presented with aspiration pneumonia and started intravenous antibiotic treatment. After failure of a first-line antiepileptic drug, lacosamide intravenous treatment was started, with complete reversal of the clinical picture. EEG then showed focal slow waves mixed to interictal epileptiform discharges over the left fronto-temporal regions. The patient was then discharged home with an oral lacosamide treatment and at 3 months she was seizure-free. Our case report confirms the efficacy of lacosamide in status epilepticus, highlighting its safety and tolerability in an elderly and fragile patient with multiple comorbidities and drug therapy.",

Data of 3 812 patients diagnosed with coronary heart disease by coronary angiography and successfully completed PCI in the Department of Cardiology, TEDA International Cardiovascular Hospital from October 2016 to September 2017 were prospectively collected. The OMT status and the occurrence of major adverse cardiovascular and cerebrovascular events (MACCE) during the hospitalization and 1, 6, and 12 months after discharge were recorded. Patients were divided into OMT group (=1 299) and non-OMT group (=2 289) according to their adherence to OMT after PCI. Chi-square test was used to compare the differences of MACCE between groups, and to screen for significant differences and clinically significant variables between groups. Cox regression model was used to analyze the influencing factors of MACCE after PCI.  Among 3 588 patients (224 cases lost to follow-up), 58.8% (2 110\/3 588) used OMT during hospitalization after PCI, and 36.0% (1 293\/3 588) still adhered to OMT after 12 months of follow-up. The utilization rates of OMT showed a decreasing trend, among which till the 12 month, β-blockers and ACEI\/ARB showed the greatest decreasing degree, from 75.3%(2 701\/3 588) and 75.1%(2 692\/3 588) to 59.1%(2 122\/3 588) and 53.0%(1 903\/3 588). Pearson χ analysis showed that elderly patients, the number of amalgamative diseases, history of PCI, history of chronic myocardial infarction, history of chronic renal insufficiency, the lesion counts, lesion type, the Gensini score, adhere to the OMT and smoking during the follow-up were related to postoperative MACCE, the difference was statistically significant (0.05). Cox regression model showed that OMT adherence after PCI was an independent protective factor for postoperative MACCE events (=0.471,95%: 0.300-0.734, =0.001).  The application of OMT after PCI was suboptimal, and the application rate decreased with the lengthening of the discharge time, among which the use of ACEI\/ARB and β-blockers deserved more attention. Adherence to OMT after PCI was an independent protective factor, which could reduce the incidence of postoperative MACCE and improve the prognosis of patients.",

The present study is a 24-month subgroup analysis of patients with diabetes mellitus having infrainguinal lesions treated with the Passeo-18 Lux DCB. The primary endpoints were freedom from major adverse events (MAEs) within 6 months of intervention and freedom from clinically driven target lesion revascularisation (CD-TLR) within 12 months of intervention.\nRESULTS: Of the 882 patients in the registry, 418 had diabetes (516 lesions). Most diabetics had concomitant hypertension (88.8%) and hyperlipidaemia (70.3%). Insulin dependence was observed in 48.8% of diabetics. Moreover, smoking (62.2%) and chronic renal insufficiency (41.9%) were also found to be common in this cohort. Chronic limb threatening ischemia (Rutherford class ≥4) was present in 53.1% of all patients. 22.9% of lesions were infrapopliteal, while 22.5% of lesions were treated for in-stent restenosis. The mean target lesion length was 85.6 ± 73.2 mm, and 79.4% of lesions were calcified (of which 17.9% were heavily calcified). Overall, device success was 99.7%. Freedom from MAEs was 90.5% (95% confidence interval (95% CI): 87.2-93.0) at 6 months, 85.4% (95% CI: 81.5-88.6) at 12 months and 80% (95% CI: 75.5-83.8) at 24 months. Freedom from CD-TLR was 95.9% (95% CI: 93.8-97.4), 91.6% (95% CI: 88.7-93.8), and 87.1% (95% CI: 83.5-89.9) at 6, 12, and 24 months, respectively. All-cause mortality at 24 months in diabetics was 16.0% (95% CI: 12.6-20.2), and major target limb amputation was 6.1% (95% CI: 4.1-8.9), which was significantly higher than in non-diabetics (8.4% (95% CI: 6.0-11.6), P = 0.0005 and 1.2% (95% CI: 0.5-2.9), P <0.0001, respectively). At 24 months, 82.0% of patients had improved by ≥1 Rutherford class.\nCONCLUSION: Treatment of a real-world diabetic patient population with the Passeo-18 Lux DCB resulted in high efficacy and low complication rates, despite the fact that diabetic patients usually suffer from a multitude of concomitant comorbidities.\nCLINICAL TRIAL REGISTRATION: NCT02276313.",

The study objective is to determine the effectiveness and safety of prasugrel and ticagrelor in kidney failure.\nDESIGN, SETTING, PARTICIPANTS, & MEASUREMENTS: This retrospective cohort study used United States Renal Data System data from 2012 to 2015. We identified all patients on dialysis who received a drug-eluting stent and were alive at 90 days after stent implantation. Inverse probability-weighted Cox proportional hazard models were used. Weights were estimated with propensity scores for multiple treatments.\nRESULTS: This cohort included 6648 patients on clopidogrel, 621 on prasugrel, and 449 on ticagrelor. A total of 3279 primary composite (cardiovascular death, myocardial infarction, or stroke) and 2120 clinically relevant bleeding events were observed. The incidence of the primary composite outcome of cardiovascular death, myocardial infarction, or stroke at 12 months was similar across the three treatment groups. The absolute event rate in the unweighted cohort was 144 events per 100 patient-years for clopidogrel, 126 for prasugrel, and 161 for ticagrelor. For prasugrel versus clopidogrel, the weighted hazard ratio was 0.96 (95% confidence interval, 0.82 to 1.11; =0.58). For ticagrelor versus clopidogrel, the hazard ratio was 1.00 (95% confidence interval, 0.83 to 1.20; =0.98).

We investigated the clinical and procedural factors related to major bleeding in patients with acute coronary syndrome treated with ticagrelor after coronary stent implantation. Methods and Results From the TICO (Ticagrelor Monotherapy After 3 Months in Patients Treated With New Generation Sirolimus-Eluting Stent for Acute Coronary Syndrome) randomized trial, a total of 2660 patients were included for the present study. Patients with major bleeding, defined by TIMI (Thrombolysis in Myocardial Infarction) major or Bleeding Academic Research Consortium type 3 or 5, were compared with those without major bleeding. On the basis of multivariable and receiver operating characteristic curve analyses, weight ≤65 kg, hemoglobin ≤12 g\/dL, and estimated glomerular filtration rate <60 mL\/min per 1.73 m were associated with an increased risk of major bleeding. In contrast, 3-month aspirin therapy with continued ticagrelor (versus 12-month aspirin and ticagrelor) was associated with a decreased risk of major bleeding. The lower risk of a net adverse clinical event (a composite of TIMI major bleeding and major adverse cardiac and cerebrovascular events) in patients treated with 3-month aspirin therapy reported from the TICO trial remained valid in patients with any of these risk factors (hazard ratio, 0.59; 95% CI, 0.39-0.90; =0.74). Conclusions Low body weight, anemia, and chronic kidney disease were risk factors for major bleeding after ticagrelor therapy.

        "Abstract":"INTRODUCTION: Bleeding is a concern after percutaneous coronary intervention (PCI) and subsequent dual antiplatelet therapy (DAPT). We herein report the incidence and risk factors for major bleeding in the Norwegian Coronary Stent Trial (NORSTENT).\nMATERIALS AND METHODS: NORSTENT was a randomized, double blind, pragmatic trial among patients with acute coronary syndrome or stable coronary disease undergoing PCI during 2008-11. The patients (N = 9,013) were randomized to receive either a drug-eluting stent or a bare-metal stent, and were treated with at least nine months of DAPT. The patients were followed for a median of five years, with Bleeding Academic Research Consortium (BARC) 3-5 major bleeding as one of the safety endpoints. We estimated cumulative incidence of major bleeding by a competing risks model and risk factors through cause-specific Cox models.\nRESULTS: The 12-month cumulative incidence of major bleeding was 2.3%. Independent risk factors for major bleeding were chronic kidney disease, low bodyweight (< 60 kilograms), diabetes mellitus, and advanced age (> 80 years). A myocardial infarction (MI) or PCI during follow-up increased the risk of major bleeding (HR = 1.67, 95% CI 1-29-2.15).\nCONCLUSIONS: The 12-month cumulative incidence of major bleeding in NORSTENT was higher than reported in previous, explanatory trials. This analysis strengthens the role of chronic kidney disease, advanced age, and low bodyweight as risk factors for major bleeding among patients receiving DAPT after PCI. The presence of diabetes mellitus or recurrent MI among patients is furthermore a signal of increased bleeding risk.\nCLINICAL TRIAL REGISTRATION: Unique identifier NCT00811772; http:\/\/www.clinicaltrial.gov.",

Data used in this study derived from ULTIMATE trial, which was a prospective, multicenter, randomized study. From August 2014 to May 2017, 1 448 patients with coronary heart disease undergoing DES implantation were selected from 8 domestic centers and randomly divided into two groups in the ratio of 1∶1 (IVUS or coronary angiography guided stent implantation). A total of 1 443 patients with the baseline serum creatine available were enrolled. The patients were divided into CKD group and non CKD group. CKD was defined as the estimated glomerular filtration rate (eGFR) derived from Cockcroft Gault (CG) formula< 60 ml·min·1.73 m for at least 3 months. Primary endpoint of this study was target vessel failure (TVF) at 3 years, including cardiac death, target vessel myocardial infarction, and clinically-driven target vessel revascularization. Kaplan Meier method was used for survival analysis, and log rank test was used to compare the occurrence of end-point events in each group. Cox proportional hazards model was used to calculate  and 95%, and interaction was tested. Multivariate Cox regression was used to analyze the independent influencing factors of TVF.  A total of 1 443 patients with coronary heart disease were enrolled in this study, including 349 (24.2%) patients in CKD group and 1 094 patients in non CKD group. In CKD group, IVUS was used to guide stent implantation in 180 cases and angiography was used in 169 cases; in non CKD group, IVUS was used to guide stent implantation in 543 cases and angiography was used in 551 cases. Three-year clinical follow-up was available in 1 418 patients (98.3%). The incidence of TVF in CKD group was 12.0% (42\/349), which was higher than that in non CKD group (7.4% (81\/1 094) ( = 0.01). The difference was mainly due to the higher cardiac mortality in CKD group (4.6% (16\/349) vs. 1.5% (16\/1094), <0.001). In CKD group, the incidence of TVF in patients who underwent IVUS guided stent implantation was lower than that in angiography guided stent implantation (8.3% (15\/180) vs. 16.0% (27\/169),  = 0.03). There was no significant difference in the incidence of TVF between IVUS guided stent implantation and angiography guided stent implantation in non CKD group (5.9% (32\/543) vs. 8.9% (49\/551),  = 0.06), and there was no interaction ( = 0.47). Multivariate Cox regression analysis showed that IVUS guidance ( = 0.56, 95% 0.39-0.81,  = 0.002), CKD ( = 1.83, 95% 1.17-2.87,  = 0.010) and stent length (every 10 mm increase) ( = 1.11, 95% 1.04-1.19,  = 0.002) were independent risk factors for TVF within 3 years after DES implantation.  CKD patients undergoing DES implantation are associated with a higher risk of 3-year TVF. More importantly, the risk of TVF could be significantly decreased through IVUS guidance in comparison with angiography guidance in patients with CKD.",

        "Abstract":"OBJECTIVE: To investigate the relationship between chronic kidney disease (CKD) and the severity and long-term prognosis of patients with coronary artery disease (CAD) after drug-eluting stent (DES) implantation.\nMETHODS: There were 814 patients, who consecutively received a DES implantation, selected for this study. They were divided into two groups, according to whether or not they suffered CKD. There were 254 cases in the CKD group (31.2%), while there were 560 cases (68.8%) in the control group. The clinical characteristics, coronary artery lesions, and major adverse cardiac and cerebrovascular events (MACCE) of the two groups were compared, and the relationship between risk factors and MACCEs was analyzed by multivariate logistic regression.\nRESULTS: Compared with the control group, the CKD group had more severe coronary artery stenosis, expressed as the more diseased arteries (2.15 ± 0.82 vs 1.87 ± 0.83,  = 0.001), a high incidence of three diseased arteries (42.0% vs 28.3%,  = 0.001), and a higher Gensini score [37 (18.6, 66) vs 27.5 (12, 52.5),  = 0.009].

Cardiac surgery induces systemic inflammation and may impair renal function, affecting patient outcome. EA-230 exerted immunomodulatory and renoprotective effects in preclinical models and was safe and showed efficacy in phase I and II human studies.\nDESIGN: Double-blinded, placebo-controlled, randomized study.\nSETTING: Collaboration of the Cardiothoracic Surgery, Anesthesiology, and the Intensive Care departments of a tertiary hospital in the Netherlands.\nPATIENTS: One hundred eighty patients undergoing an on-pump coronary artery bypass procedure with or without concomitant valve surgery.\nINTERVENTIONS: Ninety mg\/kg\/hr EA-230 or placebo administered during surgery.\nMEASUREMENTS AND MAIN RESULTS: During the study, no safety concerns emerged. EA-230 did not modulate interleukin-6 plasma concentrations (area under the curve 2,730 pg\/mL × hr [1,968-3,760] vs 2,680 pg\/mL × hr [2,090-3,570] for EA-230 and placebo group, respectively; p = 0.80). Glomerular filtration rate increased following surgery (mean ± sem increase in the EA-230 vs placebo groups: glomerular filtration rateiohexol measured using iohexol plasma clearance: 19 ± 2 vs 16 ± 2 mL\/min\/1.73 m2; p = 0.13 and estimated glomerular filtration rate with the Modification of Diet in Renal Disease equation using creatinine: 6 ± 1 vs 2 ± 1 mL\/min\/1.73 m2; p = 0.01). The \"injury\" stage of the Risk, Injury, Failure, Loss of kidney function, and End-stage kidney disease criteria for acute kidney injury was 7% in the EA-230 group versus 18% in the placebo group (p = 0.07). In addition, EA-230-treated patients had a less positive fluid balance compared with placebo-treated patients (217 ± 108 vs 605 ± 103 mL; p = 0.01), while the use of vasoactive agents was similar in both groups (p = 0.39). Finally, hospital length of stay was shorter in EA-230 treated patients (8 d [7-11] vs 10 d [8-12]; p = 0.001). Efficacy results were more pronounced in patients that had longer duration of surgery and thus longer duration of study drug infusion.\nCONCLUSIONS: EA-230 was safe in patients undergoing on-pump cardiac surgery. It did not modulate interleukin-6 plasma concentrations but appeared to exert beneficial renal and cardiovascular effects and shortened in-hospital length of stay.",

        "Published":null,
        "Abstract":"Polyuria in post-kidney transplant (KT) patients is a common condition generally attributed to delayed tubular function, fluid administration, and solute diuresis. Since excessive water intake post-KT physiologically suppresses arginine vasopressin (AVP) secretion, central diabetes insipidus (CDI) caused by deficient primary AVP release can be overlooked. Although DDAVP (desmopressin) - a selective AVP V2 receptor agonist - has been used to treat massive polyuria, CDI rarely progresses to kidney injury due to the preservation of fluid balance by thirst-dependent osmoregulation. Administration of DDAVP in post-KT recipients with mild polyuria and subclinical CDI is difficult to assess, and whether long-term use of DDAVP is beneficial for the transplanted kidney has not been established. We present the case of a 36-year-old Japanese female who was diagnosed with subclinical\/partial CDI post KT. CDI was caused by a sequela of suprasellar germinoma. Graft function gradually declined without evidence of hypovolemia or hypernatremia, and a kidney biopsy revealed advanced ischemic kidney injury. Although daily oral DDAVP administration did not increase extracellular fluid volume, treatment resulted in a gradual improvement of graft function, and a follow-up transplanted kidney biopsy indicated substantial recovery.",

        "Abstract":"OBJECTIVE: Innumerable surgical techniques are currently deployed for repairing acute type A aortic dissection (ATAAD). We analyzed our results using a conservative approach of root-sparing and hemiarch techniques in higher-risk patients and root and total arch replacement for lower-risk patients.\nMETHODS: We queried our aortic database for consecutive patients who underwent ATAAD repair. Patients who underwent conservative repair (group 1) were compared with those who underwent extensive repair (group 2) using univariable and multivariable analysis.\nRESULTS: From 1997 to 2019, 343 patients underwent ATAAD repair. Two hundred forty had conservative repair (root-sparing, hemiarch) whereas 103 had extensive repair (root replacement and\/or total arch). Group 1 was older with more comorbidities such as hypertension, previous myocardial infarction, and renal dysfunction. Group 2 had more connective tissue disease (2.1% vs 12.6%; P &lt; .01), aortic insufficiency, and longer intraoperative times. The incidence of individual postoperative complications was similar regardless of approach. A composite of major adverse events (operative mortality, myocardial infarction, stroke, dialysis, or tracheostomy) was higher in the conservative group (15.1% vs 5.9%; P = .03). Operative mortality was 5.6% and not different between groups. Ten-year survival was similar with either surgical approach. Ten-year cumulative risk of reintervention was greater in group 2 (5.6% vs 21% at 10 years; P &lt; .01). In multivariable analysis, ejection fraction and diabetes were predictors of major adverse events but not extensive approach. Extensive approach was a predictor of late reoperation (odds ratio, 3.03 [95% confidence interval, 1.29-7.2]; P = .01).\nCONCLUSIONS: A tailored conservative approach to ATAAD leads to favorable operative outcomes without compromising durability.",

However, limited studies have examined the trends of these differences in a multi-ethnic Asian population.\nOBJECTIVES: To study the trends in sex and gender differences in ACS using the Malaysian NCVD-ACS Registry.\nMETHODS: Data from 24 hospitals involving 35,232 ACS patients (79.44% men and 20.56% women) from 1st. Jan 2012 to 31st. Dec 2016 were analysed. Data were collected on demographic characteristics, coronary risk factors, anthropometrics, treatments and outcomes. Analyses were done for ACS as a whole and separately for ST-segment elevation myocardial infarction (STEMI), Non-STEMI and unstable angina. These were then compared to published data from March 2006 to February 2010 which included 13,591 ACS patients (75.8% men and 24.2% women).\nRESULTS: Women were older and more likely to have diabetes mellitus, hypertension, dyslipidemia, previous heart failure and renal failure than men. Women remained less likely to receive aspirin, beta-blocker, angiotensin-converting enzyme inhibitor (ACE-I) and statin. Women were less likely to undergo angiography and percutaneous coronary intervention (PCI) despite an overall increase. In the STEMI cohort, despite a marked increase in presentation with Killip class IV, women were less likely to received primary PCI or fibrinolysis and had longer median door-to-needle and door-to-balloon time compared to men, although these had improved. Women had higher unadjusted in-hospital, 30-Day and 1-year mortality rates compared to men for the STEMI and NSTEMI cohorts. After multivariate adjustments, 1-year mortality remained significantly higher for women with STEMI (adjusted OR: 1.31 (1.09-1.57), p<0.003) but were no longer significant for NSTEMI cohort.\nCONCLUSION: Women continued to have longer system delays, receive less aggressive pharmacotherapies and invasive treatments with poorer outcome.

        "Abstract":"OBJECTIVES: To evaluate whether a single high dose of oral cholecalciferol improves the respiratory outcomes as compared with placebo among adults COVID-19 patients at moderate risk of clinical complications.\nTRIAL DESIGN: The CARED trial is an investigator-initiated, multicentre, randomized, parallel, two-arm, sequential, double-blind and placebo-controlled clinical trial. It was planned as a pragmatic trial since the inclusion criteria are broad and the study procedures are as simple as possible, in order to be implemented in the routine clinical practice in general wards in the pandemic setting and a middle-income country context. The sequential design involves two stages. The first stage will assess the effects of vitamin D supplementation on blood oxygenation (physiological effects). The second stage will assess the effects on clinical outcomes.\nPARTICIPANTS: Participants of either gender admitted to general adult wards in 21 hospital sites located in four provinces of Argentina are invited to participate in the study if they meet the following inclusion criteria and none of the exclusion criteria: Inclusion criteria SARS-CoV-2 confirmed infection by RT-PCR; Hospital admission at least 24 hours before; Expected hospitalization in the same site ≥24 hours; Oxygen saturation ≥90% (measured by pulse oximetry) breathing ambient air; Age ≥45 years or at least one of the following conditions: ○ Hypertension; ○ Diabetes; ○ At least moderate COPD or asthma; ○ Cardiovascular disease (history of myocardial infarction, percutaneous transluminal coronary angioplasty, coronary artery bypass grafting or valve replacement surgery); ○ Body mass index ≥30; Willingness to sign informed consent (online supplementary material 1 and 2).\nEXCLUSION CRITERIA: Age <18 years; Women in childbearing age; >= 72 hs since current admission; Requirement for a high dose of oxygen (>5 litres\/minute) or mechanical ventilation (non-invasive or invasive); History of chronic kidney disease requiring haemodialysis or chronic liver failure; Inability for oral intake.

The SOFAr score measured as the ratio between the pulse oximetry saturation (SpO) and FiO (27, 28) is used instead of the arterial partial pressure of oxygen (PaO). SOFAr score is a 4-points scale, with higher values indicating deeper respiratory derangement as follows: 1 PaO <400; 2 PaO <300; 3 PaO <200; 4 PaO <100. The primary outcome for the second stage is the combined occurrence of requirement ≥40% of FiO, invasive or non-invasive ventilation, up to 30 days or hospital discharge.\nRANDOMISATION: A computer-generated random sequence and the treatment assignment is performed through the web-based randomization module available in the electronic data capture system (Castor®). A randomization ratio 1:1, stratified and with permuted blocks was used. Stratification variables were diabetes (yes\/no), age (≤60\/>60 years) and the site.\nBLINDING (MASKING): Double-blind was achieved by using placebo soft gel capsules with the same organoleptic properties as the active medication. Central management of the medication is carried out by a pharmacist in charge of packaging the study drug in unblinded fashion, who have no contact with on-site investigators. Medication is packaged in opaque white bottles, each containing five soft gel capsules of the active drug or matching placebo, corresponding to complete individual treatment.

A retrospective cohort study was performed. Clinical data of patients diagnosed as advanced gastric cancer undergoing CapeOX\/SOX neoadjuvant chemotherapy and standard laparoscopic radical operation for gastric cancer in Ruijin Hospital of Shanghai Jiaotong University School of Medicine from April 2016 to April 2019 were retrospectively collected. Inclusion criteria were as follows: (1) age≥18 years; (2) gastric adenocarcinoma was confirmed by histopathology and the clinical stage was T3-4aN+M0; (3) tumor could be resectable; (4) preoperative neoadjuvant chemotherapy was CapeOX or SOX regimen without radiotherapy or other regimen chemotherapy; (5) no other concurrent malignant tumor; (6) the Eastern Cooperative Oncology Group (ECOG) score ≤ 1; (7) no bone marrow suppression; (8) normal liver and kidney function.

A total of 118 patients were enrolled as the neoadjuvant chemotherapy group, and 379 patients with locally advanced gastric cancer who received surgery combined with postoperative adjuvant chemotherapy over the same period simultaneously were included as the adjuvant chemotherapy group. After propensity score matching was performed including gender, age, ECOG score, tumor site, clinical stage, chemotherapy regimen and other factors by 1:1 ratio, there were 40 cases in each group. The differences between the two groups in general conditions, efficacy of neoadjuvant chemotherapy, intraoperative conditions, postoperative conditions, histopathological results, chemotherapy-related adverse events, and survival status were compared and analyzed.  Comparison of baseline demographics between the two groups showed no statistically significant difference (all >0.05). In the neoadjuvant chemotherapy group, 5.0% (2\/40) of patients achieved clinical complete response, 57.5% (23\/40) achieved partial response, 32.5% (13\/40) remained stable disease, and 5.0% (2\/40) had disease progression before surgery. Objective response rate was 62.5% (25\/40), and disease control rate was 95.0% (38\/40). There were no statistically significant differences between neoadjuvant chemotherapy group and adjuvant chemotherapy group in terms of operation time, intraoperative blood loss, number of lymph node harvested, length of postoperative hospital stay, and postoperative mortality and morbidity (all >0.05). Postoperative complications were well managed with conservative treatment. No Clavien-Dindo IV or V complications were observed in both groups. Pathological results showed that the proportion of patients with pathological stage T1 in the neoadjuvant chemotherapy group was significantly higher than that in the adjuvant chemotherapy group [27.5% (11\/40) vs. 5.0% (2\/40)], while the proportion of patients with pathological stage T3 was significantly lower than that in the adjuvant chemotherapy group [20.0% (8\/40) vs. 45.0% (18\/40)], with statistically significant difference (χ(2)=15.432, =0.001). In the neoadjuvant chemotherapy group, there were 4 cases of tumor regression grade 0, 8 cases of grade 1, 16 cases of grade 2, and 12 cases of grade 3. The pathological complete response rate was 10% (4\/40), the overall pathological response rate was 70.0% (28\/40). There was no statistically significant difference in the incidence of chemotherapy-related adverse events between neoadjuvant chemotherapy group and adjuvant chemotherapy group [40% (16\/40) vs. 37.5% (15\/40), 0.05). There were no statistically significant differences in OS (43 months vs. 40 months) and 3-year OS rate (66.1% vs. 59.8%) between neoadjuvant chemotherapy group and adjuvant chemotherapy group (=0.428). The disease-free survival (DFS) and 3-year DFS rates of the neoadjuvant chemotherapy group were significantly superior to those of the adjuvant chemotherapy group (36 months vs. 28 months, 51.4% vs. 35.8%, =0.048).  CapeOX or SOX regimen neoadjuvant chemotherapy is a safe, effective and feasible treatment mode for advanced gastric cancer without increasing surgical risk and can improve the DFS of patients.",

        "Abstract":"BACKGROUND: In low-resource regions, fibrinolytic therapy is often the only option for ST-elevation myocardial infarction (STEMI) patients as primary percutaneous coronary intervention (PCI) is often not available and patients are hardly transferred to a medical center with PCI capacity within the first 120 minutes. Chronic kidney disease (CKD) is one of the most frequently encountered complications of STEMI. However, the evidence for the efficacy of fibrinolytic therapy in STEMI patients with CKD is still limited. The aim of this study is to test whether CKD modifies the association between fibrinolytic therapy and short-term major adverse cardiovascular events (MACEs) among patients with STEMI.\nMETHODS AND FINDINGS: This is a real-world study analyzing the data from 9508 STEMI patients (mean age: 64.0±12.4 years; male: 70.1%) in the third phase of Clinical Pathways in Acute Coronary Syndromes program (CPACS-3), which is a large study of the management of acute coronary syndromes (ACS) in 101 county hospitals without PCI capacity in China. CKD was defined as an estimated glomerular filtration rate of less than 60 mL\/min per 1·73 m2 at the admission. The primary outcome is short-term MACEs, including all-cause death, recurrent myocardial infarction, or nonfatal stroke. Patients were recruited consecutively between October 2011 and November 2014. Out of them, 1282 patients (13.5%) were classified as having CKD. Compared with non-CKD patients, CKD patients were less likely to receive fibrinolytic therapy than non-CKD patients (26.4% vs. 38.9%, P<0.001), more likely to experience a failed fibrinolytic therapy (32.8% vs. 16.9%), and had a higher risk of short-term MACEs (19.7% vs. 5.6%). After full adjustment, use of fibrinolytic therapy was associated with a significantly lower risk of short-term MACEs in non-CKD patients (relative risk [RR] = 0.87, 95% confidence interval [CI]: 0.76-0.99), but not in CKD patients (P for interaction = 0.026). Further analysis stratified by the success of fibrinolysis showed that compared with patients who did not receive fibrinolytic therapy, patients with successful fibrinolysis had a lower risk of short-term MACEs that was similar between patients with (RR = 0.71, 95% CI: 0.55-0.82) and without CKD (RR = 0.67, 95% CI: 0.55-0.92), while patients with unsuccessful fibrinolysis had a similarly higher risk in CKD patients (RR = 1.25, 95% CI: 1.09-1.43) and non-CKD patients (RR = 1.30, 95% CI: 1.13-1.50).\nCONCLUSIONS: CKD reduced the likelihood of successful fibrinolysis and increased the risk of short-term MACEs in patients with STEMI. Attention should be paid to how to improve the success rate of fibrinolytic therapy for STEMI patients with CKD.\nTRIAL REGISTRATION: The CPACS-3 study was registered on www.clinicaltrials.gov (NCT01398228).",

        "Abstract":"BACKGROUND: The ideal drug-eluting stent (DES) for the treatment of unprotected left main coronary artery (ULMCA) is unknown. We compared percutaneous coronary intervention (PCI) using durable polymers versus early-generation, thicker strutted and coated bioabsorbable polymers for ULMCA disease.\nMETHODS: Patients who underwent ULMCA PCI (893 patients) from April 2008 to November 2014 were identified from the Grand-DES registry. The primary end point was 3-year target lesion failure (TLF) after propensity score matching.\nRESULTS: The final analysis included 754 patients (84.4%) and 139 patients (15.6%) in the durable and bioabsorbable polymer group, respectively. The groups differed significantly in lesion and procedural characteristics. Propensity score-matched analysis revealed a trend toward a lower 3-year TLF in the durable polymer group (log rank p=0.071). Independent predictors of 3-year TLF were chronic kidney disease, presentation with acute myocardial infarction, and a two-stenting technique for ULMCA lesions. Definite\/probable stent thrombosis rates at 3-years were low in both groups (0.8% vs. 0.7%, p=0.925).\nCONCLUSIONS: The safety of ULCMA PCI was excellent, and durable and bioabsorbable polymer DES provided similar clinical outcomes at 3-year follow-up. Landmark analysis revealed that the durable polymer group had a lower TLF rate from 9 months. Further studies are needed to confirm these results.",

        "Abstract":"BACKGROUND: Treatment guidelines for nonvalvular atrial fibrillation (AF) recommend use of non-vitamin K antagonist oral anticoagulants (NOACs) over warfarin, yet clinical trials excluded individuals with post cardiac surgery AF. We sought to compare outcomes with NOACs vs warfarin for new onset post cardiac surgery AF.\nMETHODS: We examined 26,522 patients from The Society of Thoracic Surgeons' database with post cardiac surgery AF who were discharged on oral anticoagulation from July 2017-December 2018. Three primary outcomes were evaluated: 30-day mortality, major bleeding complications, and stroke\/transient ischemic attack. Secondary outcomes included postoperative length of stay, 30-day myocardial infarction, venous thromboembolism, and pericardial effusion\/tamponade.\nRESULTS: A total of 9769 (36.8%) participants were prescribed NOACs and 16,753 (63.2%) warfarin. In multivariable analysis, there was no association between type of anticoagulant and 30-day major bleeding complications (odds ratio [OR] 0.76, 95% confidence interval [CI] 0.49-1.18), stroke\/transient ischemic attack (OR 0.94, 95% CI 0.53-1.67) or mortality (OR 1.08, 95% CI 0.80-1.45). After stratification by renal function or isolated coronary bypass vs valve surgery, there remained no difference in the primary outcomes. Additionally, there was no difference in 30-day myocardial infarction (OR 1.17, 95% CI 0.62-2.22), venous thromboembolism (OR 0.91, 95% CI 0.47-1.78), or pericardial effusion\/tamponade (OR 1.09, 95% CI 0.80-1.47) between the 2 groups. NOAC therapy was associated with a half-day reduction in postoperative length of stay (β -0.47, 95% CI -0.62 to -0.33).\nCONCLUSIONS: NOACs are associated with a reduction in postoperative length of stay, without excess bleeding or other short-term complications, compared with warfarin. These findings support the broader use of NOACs as a safe alternative to warfarin in patients with post cardiac surgery AF at elevated stroke risk and acceptable bleeding risk.",

        "Abstract":"INTRODUCTION: Nearly one-third of patients undergoing cardiac surgery involving cardiopulmonary bypass (CPB) experience cardiac surgery-associated (CSA) acute kidney injury (AKI); 5% require renal replacement therapy. ANG-3777 is a hepatocyte growth factor mimetic.  ANG-3777 reduces apoptosis and increases cell proliferation, migration, morphogenesis, and angiogenesis in injured kidneys. In animal models, ANG-3777 mitigates the effects of renal damage secondary to ischemia reperfusion injury and nephrotoxic chemicals. Phase 2 data in AKI of renal transplantation have shown improved renal function and comparable safety relative to placebo. The Guard Against Renal Damage (GUARD) study is a phase 2 proof of concept trial of ANG-3777 in CSA-AKI.\nMETHODS: GUARD is a 240-patient, multicenter, double-blind, randomized placebo-controlled trial to assess the efficacy and safety of ANG-3777 in patients at elevated pre-surgery risk for AKI undergoing coronary artery bypass graft (CABG) or heart valve repair\/replacement requiring CPB. Subjects are randomized 1:1 to receive ANG-3777 (2 mg\/kg) or placebo. Study drug is dosed via 4 daily intravenous 30-minute infusions. The first dose is administered less than 4 hours after completing CPB, second at 24 ± 2 hours post-CPB, with two subsequent doses at 24 ± 2 hours after the previous dose.\nRESULTS: The primary efficacy endpoint is percent change from baseline serum creatinine to mean area under the curve from days 2 through 6. Secondary endpoints include change in estimated glomerular filtration rate from baseline to day 30, the proportion of patients diagnosed with AKI by stage through day 5, and the length of CSA-AKI hospitalization. Safety will include adverse events and laboratory measures.\nCONCLUSION: This phase 2 study of ANG-3777 provides data to develop a phase 3 registrational study in this medically complex condition.",

We aimed to investigate clinical outcomes of CTO percutaneous coronary intervention (PCI) vs. medical therapy (MT) in CTO patients according to baseline renal function.  In the study population of 2,497, 1,220 patients underwent CTO PCI and 1,277 patients received MT. Patients were divided into four groups based on renal function: group 1 [estimated glomerular filtration rate (eGFR) ≥ 90 ml\/min\/1.73 m], group 2 (60 ≤ eGFR <90 ml\/min\/1.73 m), group 3 (30 ≤ eGFR <60 ml\/min\/1.73 m), and group 4 (eGFR <30 ml\/min\/1.73 m). Major adverse cardiac event (MACE) was the primary end point.  Median follow-up was 2.6 years. With the decline in renal function, MACE ( < 0.001) and cardiac death ( < 0.001) were increased. In group 1 and group 2, MACE occurred less frequently in patients with CTO PCI, as compared to patients in the MT group (15.6% vs. 22.8%,  < 0.001; 15.6% vs. 26.5%,  < 0.001; respectively). However, there was no significant difference in terms of MACE between CTO PCI and MT in group 3 (21.1% vs. 28.7%,  = 0.211) and group 4 (28.6% vs. 50.0%,  = 0.289). MACE was significantly reduced for patients who received successful CTO PCI compared to patients with MT (16.7% vs. 22.8%,  = 0.006; 16.3% vs. 26.5%,  = 0.003, respectively) in group 1 and group 2. eGFR < 30 ml\/min\/1.73 m, age, male gender, diabetes mellitus, heart failure, multivessel disease, and MT were identified as independent predictors for MACE in patients with CTOs.  Renal impairment is associated with MACE in patients with CTOs. For treatment of CTO, compared with MT alone, CTO PCI may reduce the risk of MACE in patients without chronic kidney disease (CKD). However, reduced MACE from CTO PCI among patients with CKD was not observed. Similar beneficial effects were observed in patients without CKD who underwent successful CTO procedures.",

        "Abstract":"BACKGROUND: Interventional treatment of aorto-ostial coronary stenoses is limited by stent recoil and suboptimal angiographic results, leading to restenosis and frequent re-interventions. As a potential bail-out strategy for stent recoil, implantation of an additional stent to increase radial force has been reported. Thus, we sought to investigate clinical outcomes after additional implantation of a Dynamic Renal stent (DRS), a non-coronary; bare-metal stent with very high radial force, in aorto-ostial coronary stenoses.\nMETHODS: Patients treated by implantation of DRSs for stent recoil in the ostial right coronary artery or the left main stem were identified from the hospital database. Baseline clinical and procedural characteristics were compared to patients who underwent re-intervention for in-stent-restenosis in similar segments by either implantation of conventional drug-eluting stents (DES) or paclitaxel-coated balloons (PCB). Clinical follow-ups were performed up to three years following re-intervention with the assessment of death, target lesion reintervention (TLR), and major adverse cardiac events (MACE) as a combination death, myocardial infarction and target vessel revascularization. Kaplan-Meier analyses were performed for event-free survival between the three groups.\nRESULTS: Between 05\/2013 and 07\/2019, 28 patients underwent DRS implantation of aorto-ostial coronary lesions. In comparison with 49 patients with DES implantation and 29 patients undergoing PCB treatment, no relevant differences in baseline parameters were identified. Median follow-up was 714 days, with an available follow-up of >1 year after intervention in 82.1% of patients. In the entire study cohort at two years after re-intervention, the TLR rate was 16% (17 patients), the MACE rate 37% (39 patients), and all-cause mortality 9% (10 patients), with no significant differences between the three groups.\nCONCLUSIONS: DRS implantation for treating stent recoil of aorto-ostial coronary lesions resulted in a high rate of TLR, and was associated with similar risk for death and MACE compared to treatment of in-stent-restenosis with DES or PCB. Randomized, larger comparisons of contemporary DES in patients exclusively presenting with stent recoil are necessary to further define the efficacy and safety of this approach.",

Association between demographics, baseline comorbidities, procedures and antiplatelet prescription were examined as secondary outcome using multivariate logistic regression model, with commonly used antiplatelet groups selected for comparison.\nRESULTS: Among the included 14 716 patients, 5888 (40.0%) discharged with aspirin alone, 6888 (46.8%) discharged with dual antiplatelet therapy (DAPT) with clopidogrel, and 973 (6.6%) discharged with DAPT with prasugrel\/ticagrelor. Prescribing rate of aspirin alone decreased substantially from 56.8% in 2008 to 27.5% in 2017. Utilisation of DAPT with clopidogrel increased from 33.7% in 2008 to 52.7% in 2017. Use of DAPT with prasugrel\/ticagrelor increased from 0.3% in 2010 to 15.3% in 2017. Compared with those prescribed with DAPT with clopidogrel, male patients (adjusted OR (aOR) 1.34, 95% CI 1.09 to 1.65), patients with non-ST-elevation myocardial infarction (aOR 2.50, 1.98 to 3.16) or ST-elevation myocardial infarction (aOR 3.26, 2.59 to 4.09), use of glycoprotein IIb\/IIIa (aOR 3.03, 2.48 to 3.68) or undergoing percutaneous coronary intervention (aOR 3.85, 3.24 to 4.58) or coronary artery bypass graft (aOR 6.52, 4.63 to 9.18) during index hospitalisation, concurrent use of histamine-2 receptor antagonists (aOR 1.35, 1.10 to 1.65) or proton pump inhibitors (aOR 3.57, 2.93 to 4.36) during index hospitalisation discharge were more likely to be prescribed with DAPT with prasugrel\/ticagrelor.

This study aims to explore the effect of Danhong injection on prevention of CI-AKI.\nMETHODS: A total of 12 867 patients, who received coronary angiography, percutaneous coronary intervention, enhanced CT or vascular intervention in a tertiary hospital, were enrolled for this study. Among them, 423 in the treatment group received intravenous drip of Danhong injection, and 12 444 in the control group received routine medicine. Propensity score matching was conducted to balance confounding factors between the 2 groups and then the prevention effect of Danhong injection on CI-AKI was compared between them.\nRESULTS: A total of 423 pairs of patients were matched successfully. The incidence of CI-AKI in the non-Danhong control group was higher than that in the Danhong treatment group (5.7% vs 2.4%). The difference between the 2 groups was statistically significant (<0.05).

        "Abstract":"BACKGROUND: Corynebacterium diphtheriae (C. diphtheriae) infections, usually related to upper airways involvement, could be highly invasive. Especially in developing countries, non-toxigenic C. diphtheriae strains are now emerging as cause of invasive disease like endocarditis. The present case stands out for reinforcing the high virulence of this pathogen, demonstrated by the multiple systemic embolism and severe valve deterioration. It also emphasizes the importance of a coordinated interdisciplinary work to address all these challenges related to infectious endocarditis.\nCASE PRESENTATION: A 21-year-old male cocaine drug abuser presented to the emergency department with a 1-week history of fever, asthenia and dyspnea. His physical examination revealed a mitral systolic murmur, signs of acute arterial occlusion of the left lower limb, severe arterial hypotension and acute respiratory failure, with need of vasoactive drugs, orotracheal intubation\/mechanical ventilation, empiric antimicrobial therapy and emergent endovascular treatment. The clinical suspicion of acute infective endocarditis was confirmed by transesophageal echocardiography, demonstrating a large vegetation on the mitral valve associated with severe valvular regurgitation. Abdominal ultrasound was normal with no hepatic, renal, or spleen abscess. Serial blood cultures and thrombus culture, obtained in the vascular procedure, identified non-toxigenic C. diphtheriae, with antibiotic therapy adjustment to monotherapy with ampicillin. Since the patient had a severe septic shock with sustained fever, despite antimicrobial therapy, urgent cardiac surgical intervention was planned. Anatomical findings were compatible with an aggressive endocarditis, requiring mitral valve replacement for a biological prosthesis. During the postoperative period, despite an initial clinical recovery and successfully weaning from mechanical ventilation, the patient presented with a recrudescent daily fever. Computed tomography of the abdomen revealed a hypoattenuating and extensive splenic lesion suggestive of abscess. After sonographically guided bridging percutaneous catheter drainage, surgical splenectomy was performed. Despite left limb revascularization, a forefoot amputation was required due to gangrene. The patient had a good clinical recovery, fulfilling 4-weeks of antimicrobial treatment.\nCONCLUSION: Despite the effectiveness of toxoid-based vaccines, recent global outbreaks of invasive C. diphtheriae infectious related to non-toxigenic strains have been described. These infectious could be highly invasive as demonstrated in this case. Interdisciplinary work with an institutional \"endocarditis team\" is essential to achieve favorable clinical outcomes in such defiant scenarios.",

Although the preoperative NCSS score was lower in the older group, there was no significant difference in the degree of improvement in the NCSS score after surgery.\nCONCLUSIONS: The findings of this study suggest that we should not hesitate to perform surgery for cervical spondylotic myelopathy in elderly patients with favorable cardiorespiratory function.",

        "Abstract":"Intrarenal robust inflammatory response following ischemia-reperfusion injury (IRI) is a major factor in the pathogenesis of renal injury in ischemic acute kidney injury (AKI). Although numerous studies have investigated various agents of immune modulation or suppression for ischemic AKI, few showed reproducible effects. We hypothesized that poly (ADP-ribose) polymerase (PARP) inhibitor may favorably change post-ischemic intrarenal immunologic micromilieu by reducing damage-associated molecular pattern (DAMP) signals and improve renal outcome in ischemic AKI. The effects of JPI-289 (a PARP inhibitor) on early renal injury in a murine IRI model and hypoxic HK-2 cell model were investigated. Bilateral IRI surgery was performed in three groups of 9-week-old male C57BL\/6 mice (control, JPI-289 50 mg\/kg, and JPI-289 100 mg\/kg; n = 9-10 in each group). Saline or JPI-289 was intraperitoneally injected. Renal function deterioration was significantly attenuated in the JPI-289 treatment groups in a dose-dependent manner. Inflammatory cell infiltration and proinflammatory cytokine\/chemokine expressions in the post-ischemic kidneys were also attenuated by JPI-289 treatment. JPI-289 treatment at 0.5 and 0.75 μg\/ml facilitated the proliferation of hypoxic HK-2 cells. PARP inhibition with JPI-289 treatment showed favorable effects in ischemic AKI by attenuating intrarenal inflammatory cascade in a murine model and facilitating proliferation of hypoxic HK-2 cells.",

        "Abstract":"INTRODUCTION: Compared to bare-metal stents (BMS), drug-eluting stents reduce stent restenosis and improve subsequent revascularization rates. The impact on patients' survival has been the subject of debate.\nOBJECTIVE: To assess the long-term (10-year) survival of patients undergoing percutaneous coronary intervention (PCI) with first-generation sirolimus-eluting stents (SES) in comparison with BMS.\nMETHODS: In a single-center registry, 600 consecutive patients who underwent successful PCI with SES between April 2002 and February 2003 were compared to 594 patients who underwent PCI with BMS between January 2002 and April 2002, just before the introduction of SES. Clinical and procedural data were collected at the time of intervention and 10-year survival status was assessed via the national life status database.\nRESULTS: All baseline characteristics were similar between groups except for smaller stent diameter (2.84±0.38 vs. 3.19±0.49 mm; p<0.001), greater stent length (18.50±8.2 vs. 15.96±6.10 mm; p<0.001) and higher number of stents per patient (1.95 vs. 1.46, p<0.001) in the SES group. Overall five- and 10-year all-cause mortality was 9.6% (n=110) and 22.7% (n=272), respectively. The adjusted HR for 10-year mortality in patients undergoing PCI with SES was 0.74 (95% CI 0.58-0.94; p=0.013), corresponding to a relative risk reduction of 19.8%. Other than PCI with BMS, older age, chronic kidney disease, chronic obstructive pulmonary disease and lower ejection fraction were independent predictors of 10-year mortality.\nCONCLUSION: To date, this is the longest follow-up study ever showing a potential survival benefit of first-generation sirolimus-eluting stents versus bare-metal stents, supporting prior observations on their sustained efficacy and safety relative to contemporary BMS.",

The optimal duration of dual antiplatelet therapy (DAPT) after drug-eluting stent (DES) implantation is not established in dialysis patients, who are usually excluded from randomized studies. Since recent studies implied the benefits of prolonged DAPT >12 months in chronic kidney disease, we investigated the effectiveness and safety of prolonged DAPT in dialysis patients with higher cardiovascular risks.\nMETHODS: In this nationwide population-based study, we analyzed dialysis patients who underwent DES implantation from 2008 to 2015. Continued DAPT was compared with discontinued DAPT using landmark analyses, including free-of-event participants at 12 ( = 2246), 15 ( = 1925) and 18 months ( = 1692) after DES implantation. The primary outcome was major adverse cardiovascular events (MACEs): a composite of mortality, nonfatal myocardial infarction, coronary revascularization and stroke. Major bleeding was a safety outcome. Inverse probability of treatment weighting Cox regression was performed.\nRESULTS: Mean follow-up periods were 278.3-292.4 days, depending on landmarks. Overall, incidences of major bleeding were far lower than those of MACE. Continued DAPT groups showed lower incidences of MACE and higher incidences of major bleeding, compared with discontinued DAPT groups. In Cox analyses, continued DAPT reduced the hazards of MACE at the 12- [hazard ratio (HR) = 0.74, 95% confidence interval (CI) 0.61-0.90; P=0.003], 15- (HR = 0.78, 95% CI 0.64-0.96; P=0.019) and 18-month landmarks (HR = 0.79, 95% CI 0.63-0.99; P=0.041), but without a significant increase in major bleeding at 12 (HR = 1.39, 95% CI 0.90-2.16; P=0.14), 15 (HR = 1.13, 95% CI 0.75-1.70; P=0.55) or 18 months (HR = 1.27, 95% CI 0.83-1.95; P=0.27).\nCONCLUSIONS: Prolonged DAPT reduced MACE without significantly increasing major bleeding in patients who were event-free at 12 months after DES implantation.

The main objective was to evaluate the effectiveness and the safety of prolonged dual antiplatelet therapy (DAPT). The primary outcome was a composite of mortality, non-fatal myocardial infarction, coronary revascularization and stroke, significantly lowered by a longer DAPT regimen at 12, 15 and 18 months, respectively. Longer DAPT tended to be correlated with higher bleeding events at all landmarks, with no statistical significance. An important element was that almost 75% of the index events were acute coronary syndromes. This study presents the first solid evidence for a significant benefit of prolonged DAPT in dialysis patients receiving a DES. We believe that end-stage renal disease is still in the middle of a rope game, being pulled to one side or another by other features, inclining towards a higher bleeding risk or towards higher ischaemic risk. The acute versus elective presentation seems to weigh in choosing the antiplatelet regimen. The 'one-size-fits-all strategy' is not suitable for this particular group. Probably in the future, practitioners will be provided with decision pathways generated by artificial intelligence algorithms yielding 'truly individualized' DAPT protocols for every single patient.",

        "Abstract":"The recently published ISCHEMIA trial which is a prospective randomized multi-centre trial has concluded that there was no evidence that an initial invasive strategy of revascularisation in patients with stable angina reduced the risk of ischaemic cardiovascular events or death from any cause. The trial has confirmed that patients with stable angina do not greatly benefit from revascularisation and optimal medical treatment (OMT) is an acceptable alternative. The trial has also confirmed that in patients with stable angina and end-stage renal impairment, OMT is once again an equally effective initial strategy. While the ISCHEMIA trial is one of the most rigorously and meticulously conducted trial, exclusion of symptomatic patients, recruitment of patients who are not known to derive significant benefit from revascularisation and those who were at low risk of clinical events, along with a short follow-up period, may all have contributed to the lack of difference seen between the groups. The fact that the ISCHEMIA trial does not represent the entire cohort of real-life patients requiring revascularisation should be borne in mind, and care should be taken in extrapolating these results to the wider group of patients requiring revascularisation for coronary artery disease.",

The goal of this study was to assess outcomes of PCI with drug-eluting balloons in individuals with CKD.\nMETHODS: In a retrospective analysis, outcomes of PCI with drug-eluting balloons were compared between 101 patients with CKD and 261 without CKD. CKD was defined as estimated glomerular filtration rate < 60 ml\/min\/1.73m. We compared demographics, procedure data and clinical outcomes in the first and second years following the procedure.\nRESULTS: Rates of major adverse cardiac events (MACE) and myocardial infarction were higher in patients with than without CKD: 23.8% vs. 13.8%, P < 0.005 and 15.9% vs. 3.8%, P < 0.001, respectively.

Investigating studies on routine hydration therapy have frequently included patients with stable coronary artery disease and high risk of CI-AKI [estimated glomerular filtration rate (eGFR) < 60 ml\/min]. However, data on routine hydration treatment in non-ST segment elevation myocardial infarction (NSTEMI) patients with eGFR ≥60 ml\/min are insufficient. We aimed to investigate the association between routine hydration therapy and CI-AKI development in NSTEMI patients at low risk for nephropathy.\nMETHODS AND RESULTS: We randomly assigned a total of 401 NSTEMI patients to two groups: the routine hydration group (198 patients) and the nonhydration group (control group) (203 patients). Intravenous hydration with isotonic saline (1 ml\/kg\/h, 0.9% sodium chloride) was given for 3-12 h before and 24 h after contrast exposure to the hydration group. CI-AKI was defined as the increase in serum creatinine values 0.5 mg\/dl or 25% between 48 and 72 h after the invasive procedures. In our study, the incidence of CI-AKI development in the routine hydration group (7.1%) was significantly lower than in the nonhydration group (14.1%) (P: 0.02). This study revealed that older age, amount of contrast media, and routine hydration were independent risk factors for developing CI-AKI (P < 0.01, P: 0.04, P < 0.01, respectively).\nCONCLUSION: We found that preprocedural and postprocedural intravenous hydration therapy reduces the development of CI-AKI in patients with NSTEMI at low risk for CI-AKI.

It occurs in about 5% to 10% of patients after primary percutaneous coronary intervention. The CHA2DS2-VASc score can be easily calculated in daily practice and the components of this score are similar to common risk factors for no-reflow. Chronic renal disease generates a hypercoagulable state, which is associated with increased risk of no-reflow in cases of ST-segment elevation myocardial infarction (STEMI). A modified CHA2DS2-VASc score has been developed to include patients with renal dysfunction. The aim of this study was to investigate the prognostic significance of this scoring system, the RCHA2DS2-VASc score, in patients with no-reflow.\nMETHODS: A total of 75 patients with no-reflow and 1138 patients without no-reflow after STEMI were retrospectively enrolled in this study. The CHA2DS2-VASc and RCHA2DS2-VASc scores of the two groups were compared.\nRESULTS: The median CHA2DS2-VASc score and the median RCHA2DS2-VASc score were significantly higher in the no-reflow group (p<.001, for both). There was a statistically significant difference between the groups in all of the components of the CHA2DS2-VASc score. An RCHA2DS2-VASc score of ≥2 was a predictor of no-reflow with a sensitivity of 83% and specificity of 62%.\nCONCLUSION: The RCHA2DS2-VASc score is a simple, inexpensive, and easily accessible score to predict no-reflow.",

        "Abstract":"PURPOSE: Develop a prediction model to determine the impact of patient and lesion factors on freedom from target lesion revascularization (ffTLR) for patients who are candidates for Zilver PTX drug-eluting stent (DES) treatment for femoropopliteal lesions.\nMETHODS: Patient factors, lesion characteristics, and TLR results from five global studies were utilized for model development. Factors potentially associated with TLR (sex, age, diabetes, hypertension, hypercholesterolemia, renal disease, smoking status, Rutherford classification, lesion length, reference vessel diameter (RVD), popliteal involvement, total occlusion, calcification severity, prior interventions, and number of runoff vessels) were analyzed in a Cox proportional hazards model. Probability of ffTLR was generated for three example patient profiles via combinations of patient and lesion factors. TLR was defined as reintervention performed for ≥ 50% diameter stenosis after recurrent clinical symptoms.\nRESULTS: The model used records from 2227 patients. The median follow-up time was 23.9 months (range: 0.03-60.8). The Kaplan-Meier estimates for ffTLR were 90.5% through 1 year and 75.2% through 5 years. In a multivariate analysis, sex, age, Rutherford classification, lesion length, RVD, total occlusion, and prior interventions were significant factors. The example patient profiles have predicted 1-year ffTLRs of 97.4, 92.3, and 86.0% and 5-year predicted ffTLRs of 92.8, 79.5, and 64.8%. The prediction model is available as an interactive web-based tool ( https:\/\/cooksfa.z13.web.core.windows.net ).\nCONCLUSIONS: This is the first prediction model that uses an extensive dataset to determine the impact of patient and lesion factors on ffTLR through 5 years and provides an interactive web-based tool for expected patient outcomes with the Zilver PTX DES.\nCLINICAL TRIAL REGISTRATIONS: Zilver PTX RCT unique identifier: NCT00120406; Zilver PTX single-arm study unique identifier: NCT01094678; Zilver PTX China study unique identifier: NCT02171962; Zilver PTX US post-approval study unique identifier: NCT01901289; Zilver PTX Japan post-market surveillance study unique identifier: NCT02254837.\nLEVELS OF EVIDENCE: Zilver PTX RCT: Level 2, randomized controlled trial; Single-arm study: Level 4, large case series; China study: Level 4, case series; US post-approval study: Level 4, case series Japan PMS study: Level 4, large case series.",

        "Abstract":"['Salvia miltiorrhiza', 'P', 'P', 'P', 'P', 'P', 'P', 'P']\nThe distribution of active compounds of traditional Chinese medicine  Bunge (Chinese name: Danshen) in vivo was determined by establishing a liquid extraction surface analysis coupled with the tandem mass spectrometry (LESA-MS\/MS) method. Stability analysis and distribution analysis were designed in the present study using normal animals or a myocardial ischemia model. The model assessment was performed four weeks after surgery, and then three groups were created: a normal-dose group, a model-blank group, and a model-dose group. Meanwhile, Danshen decoction administration began in dose groups and lasted for four weeks. In stability analysis, four salvianolic acids-Danshensu (DSS), caffeic acid (CAA), rosmarinic acid (RA), and salvianolic acid A (SAA)-in kidney tissues from the normal-dose group were detected by LESA-MS\/MS under four conditions, and then distribution analysis was conducted in different tissues using the same method. Ejection fraction (EF) and fractional shortening (FS) in animals from two model groups decreased significantly four weeks after surgery ( < 0.01) and were improved after four weeks of Danshen decoction administration ( < 0.01). Results of stability analysis demonstrated that this method was basically stable since there were no significant differences in signal intensities of DSS, CAA, and SAA under four conditions ( > 0.05). Distribution analysis showed the signal intensities of DSS in the liver and kidney and SAA in the heart were higher in the model-dose group than in the normal-dose group ( < 0.05 or  < 0.01). Signal intensities of RA in the liver and kidney, and SAA in the liver were lower in the model-dose group compared with the normal-dose group ( < 0.05 or  < 0.01). In conclusion, Danshen decoction has the effect of improving the ischemic condition in a chronic myocardial ischemia model, and the content of two active compounds increased in the targets. These findings contribute to an understanding of the therapeutic role of Danshen in cardiovascular disease.",

        "Abstract":"BACKGROUND: The positive interaction of ticagrelor with the metabolism of adenosine has been claimed for the large antithrombotic and antiischemic benefits of this antiplatelet agent in acute coronary syndromes (ACS). Adenosine catabolism is regulated by the activity of the adenosine deaminase enzyme (ADA), for which several polymorphisms have been identified. Therefore, the aim of our study was to explore the impact of the rs73598374 polymorphism of ADA gene on platelet reactivity in ACS patients treated with ticagrelor.\nMETHODS: We included consecutive patients receiving ASA and ticagrelor after an ACS and coronary intervention. Platelet reactivity was evaluated by impedance aggregometry at 30-90 days post-discharge. The genetic analysis was carried out by PCR and RFLP. Clinical endpoints were mortality, cardiovascular death, recurrent myocardial infarction or coronary revascularization at the maximum available follow-up.\nRESULTS: Our population is represented by 464 patients, of whom 33.4% were A-heterozygotes and 6 homozygotes. A-allele carriers showed a greater prevalence of renal failure (p = 0.02) and a lower rate of previous coronary artery bypass graft (p = 0.03) and statin treatment (p = 0.02). No differences in the mean values of platelet reactivity or HRPR on ticagrelor were found according to the ADA genotype (11.3%vs13.9%, p = 0.45; adjusted OR[95% CI] = 1.17[0.64-2.14], p = 0.61). At follow up, patients carrying the A-allele showed a non-significantly lower incidence of ACS and repeated unplanned revascularization, although with no effect on mortality.\nCONCLUSIONS: In the present study the rs73598374 polymorphism of the ADA gene did not affect platelet reactivity or the long-term prognosis in patients with ACS receiving dual antiplatelet therapy with ASA and ticagrelor.",

        "Abstract":"BACKGROUND: Contrast-induced nephropathy (CIN) has become a common cause of hospital-acquired acute kidney injury in elderly patients. Trimetazidine (TMZ) is a type of anti-ischemic drug developed in recent years, which can reduce the incidence of CIN. This study aimed to evaluate the efficacy of TMZ in the prevention of contrast-induced nephropathy in elderly patients with renal insufficiency undergoing percutaneous coronary intervention (PCI) and to explore the mechanism of action.\nMETHODS: A total of 310 elderly patients with renal insufficiency undergoing elective PCI were enrolled and randomly assigned to a control group (n = 155, hydration only) and a TMZ group (n = 155, 20 mg thrice daily orally 24 hours before and 72 hours after PCI). The primary endpoint of the study was the incidence of CIN, which was defined as an increase of 25% or more, or an absolute increase of 0.5 mg\/dL or more in serum creatinine from baseline value, at 48 to 72 hours following the exposure to contrast media (CM).\nRESULTS: The incidence of CIN was significantly lower in the TMZ group than that in the control group (3.2% vs. 9.7%, p = 0.021). There was no difference regarding the incidence of major adverse events during hospitalization between the TMZ group and control group (1.9% vs. 2.6%, p = 1.000). Binary logistic regression results showed that TMZ was protective factors of CIN (OR = 0.274; 95% CI: 0.089-0.847; p = 0.025).\nCONCLUSION: Therefore, we came to the conclusion that prophylactic administration of TMZ can prevent the occurrence of CIN in elderly patients with renal insufficiency undergoing PCI and has a certain protective effect on the renal function of patients. According to the experimental results and the mechanism of TMZ on cardiomyocytes, we speculate that TMZ increases kidney glucose metabolism, reduces fatty acid oxidation, and also has a protective effect on kidney free radical damage and ischemia-reperfusion injury.",

The preferred management of postoperative hemorrhage in this population is not well described. We hypothesized a difference in outcomes with operative versus nonoperative management of hemorrhage after kidney transplantation.\nMETHODS: We conducted a retrospective cohort study of consecutive KTs from 2012 to 2019 (living and deceased donors). We defined hemorrhage based on the objective finding of hematoma on either ultrasound or CT scan. Management was defined as operative (surgical intervention with or without transfusion) or nonoperative (with or without transfusion).\nRESULTS: We performed 1758 KTs of which 135 (8%) demonstrated hematoma on ultrasound or CT scan (66 operative vs 69 nonoperative management). The clinical signs and symptoms of low urine output ( = .044), drop in hemoglobin ( < .001), abdominal pain ( = .005), and MAP < 70 mm Hg ( = .034) were 92.5% predictive of postoperative hemorrhage in our KT patients.

There are limited data on the outcomes of surgical coronary revascularization in this patient population. This study investigated outcomes in patients with end- stage renal or hepatic disease who were undergoing coronary artery bypass grafting (CABG) to attain kidney or liver transplant candidacy.\nMETHODS: This study was a retrospective analysis of all patients who underwent isolated CABG at our institution, Indiana University School of Medicine (Indianapolis, IN), between 2010 and 2016. Patients were divided into 2 cohorts: pretransplant (those undergoing surgery to attain renal or hepatic transplant candidacy) and nontransplant (all others). Baseline characteristics and postoperative outcomes were compared between the groups.\nRESULTS: A total of 1801 patients were included: 28 in the pretransplant group (n = 22, kidney; n = 7, liver) and 1773 in the nontransplant group. Major adverse postoperative outcomes were significantly greater in the pretransplant group compared with the nontransplant group: 30-day mortality (14.3% vs 2.8%; P = .009), neurologic events (17.9% vs 4.8%; P = .011), reintubation (21.4% vs 5.8%; P = .005), and total postoperative ventilation (5.2 hours vs 5.0 hours; P = .0124). The 1- and 5-year mortality in the pretransplant group was 17.9% and 53.6%, respectively. Of the pretransplant cohort, 3 patients (10.7%) underwent organ transplantation (all kidney) at a mean 436 days after CABG. No patients underwent liver transplantation.\nCONCLUSIONS: Outcomes after CABG in pre-kidney transplant and pre-liver transplant patients are poor. Despite surgical revascularization, most patients do not ultimately undergo organ transplantation.

The purpose of this study was to evaluate (1) the prognostic effect of ESC guideline-endorsed HTR features on long-term clinical outcomes and (2) whether the outcomes of HTR versus non-HTR features vary by HBR status.\nMETHODS: Ten thousand one hundred sixty-seven consecutive patients who underwent percutaneous coronary intervention between January 2013 and December 2013 were prospectively enrolled in Fuwai PCI Registry. Patients who are at HTR were defined as: diffuse multivessel disease in diabetic patients, chronic kidney disease, at least three stents implanted, at least three stents lesions treated, bifurcation with two stents implanted, total stent length > 60 mm, or treatment of chronic total occlusion. The definition of HBR was based on the Academic Research Consortium for HBR criteria. The primary ischemic outcome was major adverse cardiac event (MACE), a composite of cardiac death, myocardial infarction, target vessel revascularization and stent thrombosis. The primary bleeding outcome was clinically relevant bleeding, defined according to Bleeding Academic Research Consortium (BARC) type 2, 3 or 5 bleeding.\nRESULTS: With a 2.4-year median follow-up, 4430 patients (43.6%) having HTR experienced a significantly higher risk of MACE (hazard ratio [HR] : 1.56, 95% confidence interval [CI]: 1.34-1.82; P < 0.001) and device-oriented composite endpoint (composite of cardiac death, target-vessel MI, and target lesion revascularization) (HR: 1.52 [1.27-1.83]; P < 0.001), compared to those having non-HTR. The risk of clinically relevant bleeding did not differ between groups (HR: 0.85 [0.66-1.08]; P = 0.174). Associations between HTR and adverse events were similar in HBR and non-HBR groups, without evidence of interaction (all P > 0.05); however, adverse event rates were highest among subjects with both HTR and HBR.\nCONCLUSIONS: ESC guideline-endorsed HTR was associated with significantly increased risk of MACE without any significant differences in clinically relevant bleeding. The presence of HBR does not emerge as a modifier of cardiovascular risk for patients at HTR, suggesting more potent and longer antiplatelet therapy may be beneficial for this patient population.",

The overall sample size in this study is expected to be 300 with 150 in the Low-Dose LMWH control group and 150 in the High-Dose LMWH intervention group, recruited over 10-11 months. Assuming an alpha of 5% (two tailed) and a percentage of patients who experience clinical worsening in the control group being between 25% and 30%, the study will have 80% power to detect at least 50% relative reduction in the risk of death between low and high doses of heparin.\nTRIAL STATUS: Protocol version 1.2 of 11\/05\/2020.

        "Abstract":"BACKGROUND: Both target vessel calcification and target vessel bifurcation are associated with worse outcomes following percutaneous coronary intervention (PCI). Whether these entities in combination interact to influence outcomes after PCI of complex coronary disease is not known.\nOBJECTIVES: This study evaluated the association of target vessel bifurcation and target vessel calcification, alone and in combination, with adverse events following PCI.\nMETHODS: Registry data from 21,165 patients who underwent PCI with drug-eluting stents (DES) between January 2009 and December 2017 were analyzed. Patients were divided into four groups according to the presence or absence of target vessel bifurcation and presence of none\/mild or moderate\/severe target vessel calcification on angiography. Associations between lesion groups and 1 year major adverse cardiac events (MACE) were examined using Cox regression analysis.\nRESULTS: At 1 year, unadjusted rates of MACE, death, myocardial infarction (MI), as well as stent thrombosis were highest in the group with both bifurcation lesion and moderate\/severe calcification. After adjusting for confounders such as age, renal disease, and smoking, hazard ratios for MACE were 1.14 (95%CI 0.99-1.33) for bifurcation with none\/mild calcification, 1.21 (95%CI 1.06-1.38) for no bifurcation and moderate\/severe calcification, and 1.37 (95%CI 1.14-1.64) for bifurcation and moderate severe calcification, compared to patients with no bifurcation and none\/mild calcification.\nCONCLUSIONS: The presence of a bifurcating target vessel with moderate\/severe calcification is associated with a higher risk of adverse outcomes than either attribute alone. New approaches are needed to improve outcomes in this subset of patients with complex coronary artery disease.",

Platelet aggregation was performed with light transmission aggregometry and results are expressed as percentage of maximum platelet aggregation. High residual platelet reactivity (HRPR) was defined as maximum platelet aggregation more than 59%.\nRESULTS: Patients with CKD [estimate glomerular filtration rate (eGFR) < 60 ml\/min\/1.73 m, n = 28] were prevalent older, diabetic, had previous coronary revascularization.

Use of bleeding avoidance strategies and bridging therapy were described and outcomes including death, stroke, and major bleeding at 30 days and 1 year were compared by OAC type.\nRESULTS: Of 13 404 patients in the Outcomes Registry for Better Informed Treatment of Atrial Fibrillation II Registry from 2013 to 2016, 741 underwent cardiac catheterization (139 with percutaneous coronary intervention) in the setting of OAC. The patients' median age was 71, 61.8% were male, white (87.2%), had hypertension (83.7%), hyperlipidemia (72.1%), diabetes mellitus (31.6%), and chronic kidney disease (28.2%); 20.2% received warfarin while 79.8% received direct acting oral anticoagulant. One third of patients underwent radial artery access, and bivalirudin was used in 4.6%. Bridging therapy was used more often in patients on warfarin versus direct acting oral anticoagulant (16.7% versus10.0%). OAC was interrupted in 93.8% of patients. Patients on warfarin versus direct acting oral anticoagulant were equally likely to restart OAC (58.0% versus 60.7%), had similar use of antiplatelet therapy (44.0% versus 41.3%) after catheterization, and had similar rates of myocardial infarction and death at 1 year, but higher rates of major bleeding (43.3 versus 12.9 events\/100 patient years) and stroke (4.9 versus 1.9 events\/100 patient years).\nCONCLUSIONS: In a real-world registry of patients with atrial fibrillation undergoing cardiac catheterization, most cases are elective, performed by femoral access, with interruption of OAC. Bleeding avoidance strategies such as radial artery access and bivalirudin were used infrequently and use of bridging therapy was uncommon. Nearly 40% of patients did not restart OAC postprocedure, exposing patients to risk for stroke.

The patients were divided into two groups according to whether AKI occurred after operation. The clinical data were obtained from hospital information system (HIS) and DoCare including general information, types of operation, preoperative complication, ejection fraction, serum creatinine (SCr), PASP, intraoperative CPB duration, aortic occlusion duration, fluid balance, blood products and drug usage, postoperative mechanical ventilation duration, length of intensive care unit (ICU) and hospital stay, and perioperative central venous pressure (CVP). Multivariate Logistic regression analysis was used to screen the risk factors of AKI after operation. According to the preoperative PASP level, the patients were divided into ≥ 60 mmHg (1 mmHg = 0.133 kPa) group and < 60 mmHg group, and the incidence of AKI and prognosis after operation were compared between the two groups. All patients were followed up by telephone after discharge, and they were divided into survival group and death group according to the follow-up results, and the clinical data were compared between the two groups. Multivariate Cox regression analysis was used to screen the risk factors of long-term prognosis. Kaplan-Meier survival curve was used to analyze the long-term prognosis of two groups with different preoperative PASP levels.\nRESULTS: 6 285 patients were enrolled in the final analysis. (1) Among the 6 285 patients, 2 592 patients (41.2%) suffered from AKI after operation, of whom 1 697 (65.5%) were stage 1 according to Kidney Disease: Improving Global Outcomes (KDIGO), which was the main type of AKI. Univariate analysis showed that age, preoperative ejection fraction, SCr, PASP, coronary heart disease, hypertension, diabetes, intraoperative CPB duration, aortic occlusion duration, fluid balance, red blood cell input and norepinephrine, dopamine, epinephrine dosage, postoperative mechanical ventilation duration, the length of ICU and hospital stay, and perioperative CVP might be the risk factors of AKI after operation. Multivariate Logistic regression analysis showed that preoperative PASP was one of independent risk factors for AKI in patients undergoing CPB heart surgery [odds ratio (OR) = 4.753, 95% confidence interval (95%CI) was 1.328-8.417, P = 0.004]. The incidence of AKI after operation in PASP ≥ 60 mmHg group was significantly higher than that in < 60 mmHg group [73.8% (712\/965) vs. 35.3% (1 880\/5 320), P < 0.01]. (2) After a follow-up of (11±3) months, 237 patients (3.8%) died in 6 285 patients. The mortality of patients in PASP ≥ 60 mmHg group was significantly higher than that in < 60 mmHg group [9.5% (92\/965) vs. 2.7% (145\/5 320), P < 0.01]. Kaplan-Meier survival curve analysis showed that there was a significant difference between the two groups in cumulative survival rate (Log-Rank test: χ = 144.400, P < 0.001). Univariate analysis showed that male, age, preoperative hypertension, ejection fraction, PASP, intraoperative CPB duration, aortic occlusion duration, fluid balance, epinephrine dosage, postoperative mechanical ventilation duration, the length of ICU and hospital stay, and perioperative CVP might be risk factors for long-term death of patients undergoing CPB heart surgery. Multivariate Cox regression analysis showed that for every 1 mmHg increase in preoperative PASP, the long-term mortality increased by 1.126 times [hazard ratio (HR) = 1.126, 95%CI was 1.003-1.604, P = 0.021].\nCONCLUSIONS: The increase of PASP is related to AKI after CPB heart surgery, which is an independent risk factor for long-term mortality.",

        "Abstract":"BACKGROUND: Bariatric surgery offers patients short- and long-term benefits to their health and quality of life. Currently, we see more patients with superior body mass index (BMI) looking for these benefits. Evidence-based medicine is integral in the evaluation of risks versus benefit; however, data are lacking in this high-risk population.\nOBJECTIVES: To assess the morbidity and mortality of patients with BMI ≥70 undergoing bariatric surgery.\nSETTING: University Hospital, Bronx, New York, United States using national database.\nMETHODS: Using the American College of Surgeons-National Surgical Quality Improvement Project (ACS-NSQIP) database for years 2005 to 2016, we identified patients who underwent primary laparoscopic sleeve gastrectomy or laparoscopic Roux-en-Y gastric bypass. Patients with BMI ≥70 were assigned to the BMI >70 (BMI70+) cohort and less obese patients were assigned to the BMI <70 (U70) cohort. Length of stay and 30-day morbidity and mortality were compared.\nRESULTS: A total of 163,413 patients underwent non-revisional bariatric surgery. Of those, 2322 had a BMI ≥70. BMI70+ was associated with increased mortality (.4% versus .1%, P = .0001), deep vein thrombosis (.6% versus .3%, P = .007), pulmonary (1.9% versus .5%, P = .0001), renal (.9% versus .2%, P = .0001), and infectious complications (1.1% versus .4%, P = .0001). BMI70+ patients had longer mean length of stay (2.6 versus 2.1 d, P = .0001) and operative time (126.1 versus 114.5 min, P = .0001). There was no statistically significant difference in the number of myocardial infarctions (.1% versus .1%, P = .319), pulmonary embolisms (.3% versus .2%, P = .596), and transfusion requirements (.1% versus .1%, P = .105) between groups.\nCONCLUSIONS: Evaluation of risk and benefit is performed on a case-by-case basis, but evidence-based medicine is critical in empowering surgeons and patients to make informed decisions. The overall rate of morbidity and mortality for BMI70+ patients undergoing bariatric surgery was increased over U70 patients but was still relatively low. Our study will allow surgeons to incorporate objective data into their assessment of risk for super-obese patients pursuing bariatric surgery.",

The overall in-hospital mortality was 3.9% (P=0.6).\nCONCLUSION: The minimally invasive approach for RMS is feasible and has an excellent cosmetic effect without increasing the risk of surgical complications.",

        "Abstract":"AIMS: There is limited information on the clinical relevance and procedural impact of coronary artery calcification (CAC) in the contemporary percutaneous coronary intervention (PCI) setting. This study sought to determine the incidence and clinical significance of procedural techniques on the outcomes in 'real-world' patients with CAC undergoing PCI with drug-eluting stents (DESs).\nMETHODS AND RESULTS: Using patient-level data from seven stent-specific, prospective DES registries, we evaluated 17 084 patients who underwent PCI with various DES types between July 2007 and July 2015. The primary outcome was target-vessel failure (TVF), defined as a composite of cardiac death, target-vessel myocardial infarction, or target-vessel revascularization. Outcomes through 3 years (and between 0-1 and 1-3 years) were assessed according to CAC status (none\/mild vs. moderate\/severe) and stenting technique (predilation or post-dilation). Among 17 084 patients with 22 739 lesions included in the pooled dataset, moderate to severe CAC was observed in 11.3% of patients (10.1% of lesions). Older age, lower BMI, diabetes, hypertension, family history of coronary artery disease, and renal failure were independent predictors of moderate\/severe CAC. The presence of moderate\/severe CAC was significantly associated with an adjusted risk of TVF at 3 years [hazard ratio, 1.37; 95% confidence interval (CI), 1.19-1.58; P < 0.001]. For severe CAC, optimal lesion preparation with predilation was associated with a lower 3-year rate of TVF (no vs. yes, 22.3 vs. 12.8%), in which the effect of predilation was prominent at the late period of 1-3 years (hazard ratio, 0.28; 95% CI, 0.12-0.69; P = 0.003) than at the early period through 1 year (hazard ratio, 1.16; 95% CI, 0.37-3.71; P = 0.80). However, post-dilation (with a high-pressure noncompliant balloon) had no effect on the outcome.\nCONCLUSIONS: In this study, moderate\/severe CAC was common (~10%) and strongly associated with TVF during 3 years of follow-up. For severe CAC, optimal lesion preparation with pre-balloon dilation has a significant effect on long-term outcomes, especially during the late period beyond 1 year.

        "Abstract":"BACKGROUND: High bleeding risk (HBR) patients undergoing percutaneous coronary intervention have been widely excluded from randomized device registration trials. The LF study (LEADERS FREE) reported superior outcomes of HBR patients receiving 30-day dual antiplatelet therapy after percutaneous coronary intervention with a polymer-free drug-coated stent (DCS). LFII was designed to assess the reproducibility and generalizability of the benefits of DCS observed in LF to inform the US Food and Drug Administration in a device registration decision.\nMETHODS: LFII was a single-arm study using HBR inclusion\/exclusion criteria and 30-day dual antiplatelet therapy after percutaneous coronary intervention with DCS, identical to LF. The 365-day rates of the primary effectiveness (clinically indicated target lesion revascularization) and safety (composite cardiac death and myocardial infarction) end points were reported using a propensity-stratified analysis compared with the LF bare metal stent arm patients as controls.\nRESULTS: A total of 1203 LFII patients were enrolled with an average 1.7 HBR criteria per patient, including 60.7% >75 years of age, 34.1% on anticoagulants, and 14.7% with renal failure. Propensity-adjusted 365-day clinically indicated target lesion revascularization was significantly lower with DCS (7.2% versus 9.2%; hazard ratio, 0.72 [95% CI, 0.52-0.98]; =0.0338 for superiority), as was the primary safety (cardiac death and myocardial infarction) composite (9.3% versus 12.4%; hazard ratio, 0.72 [95% CI, 0.55-0.94]; =0.0150 for superiority). Stent thrombosis rates were 2.0% DCS and 2.2% bare metal stent. Major bleeding at 1 year occurred in 7.2% DCS patients and 7.2% bare metal stent.\nCONCLUSIONS: LFII reproduces the results of the DCS arm of LF in an independent, predominantly North American cohort of HBR patients.",

        "Abstract":"OBJECTIVE: Despite improvements in treating human immunodeficiency virus (HIV) infection and acquired immunodeficiency syndrome (AIDS), the risk of end-stage renal disease and need for long-term arteriovenous (AV) access for hemodialysis remain high in HIV-infected patients. Associations of HIV\/AIDS with AV access creation complications have been conflicting. Our goal was to clarify short- and long-term outcomes of patients with HIV\/AIDS undergoing AV access creation.\nMETHODS: The Vascular Quality Initiative registry was queried from 2011 to 2018 for all patients undergoing AV access creation. Documentation of HIV infection status with or without AIDS was recorded. Data were propensity score matched (4:1) between non-HIV-infected patients and HIV\/AIDS patients. Subsequent multivariable analysis and Kaplan-Meier analysis were performed for short- and long-term outcomes.\nRESULTS: There were 25,711 upper extremity AV access creations identified: 25,186 without HIV infection (98%), 424 (1.6%) with HIV infection, and 101 (.4%) with AIDS. Mean age was 61.8 years, and 55.8% were male. Patients with HIV\/AIDS were more often younger, male, nonwhite, nonobese, and current smokers; they were more often on Medicaid and more likely to have a history of intravenous drug use, and they were less often diabetic and less likely to have cardiac comorbidities (P < .05 for all). There was no significant difference in autogenous or prosthetic access used in these cohorts. Wound infection requiring incision and drainage or explantation within 90 days was low for all groups (0.6% vs 1.9 vs 0%; P = .11) of non-HIV-infected patients vs HIV-infected patients vs AIDS patients. Kaplan-Meier analysis showed no significant difference in 1-year freedom from primary patency loss (43.9% vs 46.3%; P =.6), 1-year freedom from reintervention (61% vs 60.7%,; P = .81), or 3-year survival (83% vs 83.8%; P = .57) for those with and without HIV\/AIDS, respectively. Multivariable analysis demonstrated that patients with HIV\/AIDS were not at significantly higher risk for access reintervention (hazard ratio [HR], 0.97; 95% confidence interval [CI], 0.76-1.24; P = .81), occlusion (HR, 1.06; 95% CI, 0.86-1.29; P = .6), or mortality (HR, 1.08; 95% CI, 0.83-1.43; P = .57).\nCONCLUSIONS: Patients with HIV\/AIDS undergoing AV access creation have outcomes similar to those of patients without HIV infection, including long-term survival. Patients with HIV\/AIDS had fewer traditional end-stage renal disease risk factors compared with non-HIV-infected patients. Our findings show that the contemporary approach for creation and management of AV access in patients with HIV\/AIDS should be continued; however, further research is needed to identify risk factors in this population.",

        "Published":null,
        "Abstract":"OBJECTIVES: The aim of this study was to determine 1-year safety and efficacy after treatment with the COMBO and Orsiro stents.\nBACKGROUND: The COMBO stainless-steel stent has an anti-CD34 antibody coating to capture endothelial progenitor cells, thereby promoting faster endothelialization. The Orsiro is an ultrathin-strut cobalt-chromium stent, covered by an extremely thin layer of amorphous silicon carbide to minimize ion leakage. Both devices elute sirolimus from biodegradable polymers.\nMETHODS: For this analysis we included European patients from the COMBO collaboration, a patient-level pooling of 2 prospective all-comers registries of COMBO stent implantation (n = 2,775), and all patients randomized to the Orsiro stent (n = 1,169) from the Dutch BIO-RESORT (Comparison of Biodegradable Polymer and Durable Polymer Drug-Eluting Stents in an All Comers Population) randomized trial. The main outcome of interest was 1-year target lesion failure, a composite of cardiac death, target vessel myocardial infarction, and clinically driven target lesion revascularization evaluated using propensity score-matched analysis.\nRESULTS: At baseline, COMBO patients were older and had more insulin-treated diabetes, renal insufficiency, and other comorbidities. However, Orsiro patients included more current smokers and more acute coronary syndrome presentations. Orsiro patients also received longer stents and had more complex target lesions. After propensity score-matched analysis (n = 862\/arm), 1-year target lesion failure occurred in 4.1% of COMBO-treated and 2.7% of Orsiro-treated patients (hazard ratio: 1.55; 95% confidence interval: 0.92 to 2.62; p = 0.10). Definite stent thrombosis occurred in 0.5% of COMBO-treated and 0.5% of Orsiro-treated patients (p = 0.99).\nCONCLUSIONS: A propensity score-matched comparison of all comers treated with the COMBO or Orsiro stent showed no statistically significant differences.

        "Abstract":"Patients undergoing percutaneous coronary intervention (PCI) often have high-bleeding-risk (HBR) factors. Dual antiplatelet therapy (DAPT) further increases this risk of bleeding. We sought to compare clinical outcomes according to presence or absence of HBR factors in patients with elevated ischemic risk (DAPT score ≥ 2) undergoing PCI. We evaluated all patients undergoing PCI at MedStar Washington Hospital Center (January 2009 to July 2018) with DAPT score ≥2, which is associated with elevated risk of ischemic events. Patients were categorized as HBR group (HBR score ≥1) or low-bleeding-risk (LBR) group (HBR score = 0). Outcomes included major adverse cardiac events such as target vessel revascularization, stent thrombosis, death, and bleeding events at 30 days, 6 months, 1 year, and 2 years. The final cohort consisted of 7,499 patients: 3,949 patients had LBR features, and 3,550 patients had HBR features. The 2 groups were different at baseline, with HBR patients being older and having a higher prevalence of congestive heart failure and renal dysfunction than the LBR group. The mean DAPT score was 2.96±1.1 for the LBR group and 3.7±1.4 for the HBR group (p <0.001). During follow-up at 30 days, 6 months, and 1 and 2 years, the rates of target vessel revascularization and stent thrombosis were not significantly different between the 2 groups. Bleeding events and all-cause mortality were significantly more frequent in the HBR group than in the LBR group. In conclusion, patients undergoing PCI often have pre-existing risk factors that predispose them to ischemic and bleeding complications. Prolonged duration of DAPT to mitigate ischemic events could lead to a disproportionate increase in bleeding events, especially in HBR patients.",

        "Abstract":"IMPORTANCE: Prasugrel was approved at a lower dose in 2014 in Japan than in the West because East Asian patients are considered more susceptible to bleeding than Western patients. However, real-world outcomes with low-dose prasugrel treatment remain unclear.\nOBJECTIVE: To investigate the association of low-dose prasugrel vs standard-dose clopidogrel administration with short-term outcomes among patients with acute coronary syndrome undergoing percutaneous coronary intervention (PCI).\nDESIGN, SETTING, AND PARTICIPANTS: This study used data from the Japan Cardiovascular Database-Keio Interhospital Cardiovascular Studies registry, a large, ongoing, multicenter, retrospective cohort of consecutive patients who underwent PCI. The present cohort study evaluated 2770 patients with acute coronary syndrome who underwent PCI and received either low-dose prasugrel (loading dose, 20 mg; maintenance dose, 3.75 mg) or clopidogrel (loading dose, 300 mg; maintenance dose, 75 mg) in combination with aspirin between 2014 and 2018. Propensity score-matching analysis was conducted to balance the baseline characteristics of patients receiving low-dose prasugrel and those receiving clopidogrel. Data analysis was conducted in June 2019.\nEXPOSURES: Prescription of either low-dose prasugrel or standard-dose clopidogrel prior to PCI.\nMAIN OUTCOMES AND MEASURES: Primary ischemic events (in-hospital death, recurrent myocardial infarction, and ischemic stroke) and primary bleeding events, defined as bleeding complications within 72 hours after PCI consistent with the National Cardiovascular Data Registry CathPCI Registry definition.\nRESULTS: Of 2559 patients included in the study, the mean (SD) age was 67.8 (12.7) years, and 78.2% were male. In total, 1297 patients (50.7%) received low-dose prasugrel, and 1262 patients (49.3%) received clopidogrel. After propensity score matching, primary ischemic events among patients receiving low-dose prasugrel and those receiving clopidogrel were comparable (odds ratio [OR], 1.42; 95% CI, 0.90-2.23), but primary bleeding events were significantly higher among patients receiving prasugrel (OR, 2.91; 95% CI, 1.63-5.18). This increase in bleeding events was associated with the presence of a profile of high-bleeding risk (≥75 years of age, body weight <60 kg, or history of stroke or transient ischemic attack) (OR, 4.08; 95% CI, 1.86-8.97), being female (OR, 3.84; 95% CI, 1.05-14.0), or the presence of ST-segment elevation myocardial infarction (OR, 2.07; 95% CI, 1.05-4.09) or chronic kidney disease (OR, 4.78; 95% CI, 1.95-11.7).\nCONCLUSIONS AND RELEVANCE: Since its approval, low-dose prasugrel has been used by nearly 80% of patients who undergo PCI. Despite the modified dose, bleeding events were higher among patients receiving low-dose prasugrel than among patients receiving clopidogrel, with no difference in ischemic events between the 2 groups. These results suggest the importance of a risk assessment of bleeding prior to selecting a P2Y12 inhibitor, even for the use of a lower approved dose, when treating patients of East Asian descent.",

A secondary objective of the trial was to assess angina-related health status.\nMETHODS: We assessed health status with the Seattle Angina Questionnaire (SAQ) before randomization and at 1.5, 3, and 6 months and every 6 months thereafter. The primary outcome of this analysis was the SAQ Summary score (ranging from 0 to 100, with higher scores indicating less frequent angina and better function and quality of life). Mixed-effects cumulative probability models within a Bayesian framework were used to estimate the treatment effect with the invasive strategy.\nRESULTS: Health status was assessed in 705 of 777 participants. Nearly half the participants (49%) had had no angina during the month before randomization. At 3 months, the estimated mean difference between the invasive-strategy group and the conservative-strategy group in the SAQ Summary score was 2.1 points (95% credible interval, -0.4 to 4.6), a result that favored the invasive strategy. The mean difference in score at 3 months was largest among participants with daily or weekly angina at baseline (10.1 points; 95% credible interval, 0.0 to 19.9), smaller among those with monthly angina at baseline (2.2 points; 95% credible interval, -2.0 to 6.2), and nearly absent among those without angina at baseline (0.6 points; 95% credible interval, -1.9 to 3.3).

        "Abstract":"INTRODUCTION: Organ availability is limited in the face of the growing number of candidates. Using organs from individuals with an infection at the time of transplantation emerged as a possible but controversial solution.\nMATERIALS AND METHODS: Retrospective analysis of patients submitted to kidney transplantation in Hospital Garcia de Orta (Almada, Portugal) from January 2008 to March 2019, comparing outcomes between recipients of organs from donors with an active infection and noninfected donors in the referred interval.\nRESULTS: An active infection in the donor was identified in 55 cases (28.4%) from a total of 194 transplants. The most frequent site of infection was the lung (n = 30), followed by the urinary tract (n = 13); 9 donors (16.4%) had documented bacteremia. None of the identified microorganisms were multidrug-resistant. All recipients from an infected donor received adequate antibiotic prophylaxis (mean duration of 11.1 ± 3.0 days). No significant differences between groups were found regarding patients' demographics, cold ischemia time, duration of hospital stay, delayed graft function, rejection episodes, noninfectious complications, or patient and graft survival. Basiliximab was the preferred induction agent in both groups but was used in a larger proportion of recipients in the infected donor group (87.0% vs 60.6%; P = .001). The rate of infectious complications was significantly lower in the infected donor group (14.5% vs 42.4%; P = .001), and none of the previously isolated agents in the donor was found in the recipient.\nCONCLUSION: Kidney transplant using infected donors can be performed safely, without worse organ-specific or recipient outcomes, if certain conditions are considered.",

        "Abstract":"2\nObjective Although the importance of evidence-based optimal medical therapy (OMT) after acute myocardial infarction (AMI) has been recognized, the prescription rate of OMT is not sufficiently high in real-word clinical settings. The purpose of this study was to identify the clinical characteristics of AMI patients who did not receive OMT. Methods The present study was a retrospective study. OMT was defined as the combination of antiplatelet therapy, angiotensin-converting enzyme (ACE) inhibitors\/angiotensin II receptor blockers (ARBs), beta-blockers, and statins at the time of hospital discharge. Non-OMT was defined as the lack of either antiplatelet therapy, ACE inhibitors\/ARBs, beta-blockers, or statins. Results A total of 457 AMI patients were included as the final study population, and 98 patients (22.4%) lacked at least 1 OMT medication. The prescription rates of antiplatelet therapy, ACE inhibitors\/ARBs, beta-blockers, and statins were 98.7%, 87.5%, 90.4%, and 96.7%, respectively. In the multivariate logistic regression analysis, age [per 1-year increase: odds ratio (OR) 1.033, 95% confidence interval (CI) 1.007-1.059, p=0.014], hemodialysis (vs. no hemodialysis: OR 2.707, 95% CI 1.082-6.774, p=0.033), estimated glomerular filtration rate <30 mL\/min\/1.73 m without hemodialysis (OR 4.585, 95% CI 1.975-10.644, p<0.001), AMI caused by vasospastic angina (VSA) (vs. no VSA: OR 13.198, 95% CI 1.809-96.260, p=0.011), and asthma (vs. no asthma: OR 7.241, 95% CI 1.716-30.559, p=0.007) were significantly associated with non-OMT, whereas heart rate on admission (per 1-bpm increase: 0.987, 95% CI 0.975-0.999, p=0.033), any PCI (vs. no PCI: OR 0.156, 95% CI 0.066-0.373, p<0.001), and ST-elevation myocardial infarction (STEMI) (vs. NSTEMI: OR 0.384, 95% CI 0.218-0.675, p=0.001) were inversely associated with non-OMT. Conclusion An advanced age, VSA, bradycardia, asthma, impaired renal function, non-PCI revascularization, and non-ST-elevation myocardial infarction were significantly associated with non-OMT.",

        "Abstract":"OBJECTIVE: We compared 1-year outcomes in insulin-treated diabetes mellitus (ITDM) and non-ITDM patients compared to nondiabetic (DM) patients following contemporary percutaneous coronary intervention (PCI).\nBACKGROUND: ITDM is associated with extensive atherosclerotic disease and worse cardiovascular prognosis compared to non-ITDM patients.\nMETHODS: We evaluated PCI patients at a large tertiary center from 2010 to 2016, grouped according to diabetes and treatment status at baseline. One-year major adverse cardiac events (MACE) were defined as a composite of death, myocardial infarction (MI), or target vessel revascularization. Outcomes were adjusted using multivariable Cox regression methods.\nRESULTS: During the study period, 16,889 patients underwent PCI including 13.7% ITDM, 34.0% non-ITDM, and 52.3% non-DM patients. Patients with DM were younger, including more females and non-white patients, with higher body mass index and greater prevalence of prior revascularization and chronic kidney disease. Compared to others, ITDM patients more often presented with acute coronary syndrome, in-stent restenosis, or severe lesion calcification. There were no differences in discharge rates of dual antiplatelet therapy and statins, whereas beta-blockers were more commonly prescribed in DM patients. At 1-year, both ITDM and non-ITDM patients had greater risk of MACE compared with non-DM patients, and ITDM conferred greater adjusted risk than non-ITDM (ITDM = HR: 2.11, 95% CI [1.79,2.50]; non-ITDM = HR: 1.27, 95%CI [1.09,1.47]).\nCONCLUSIONS: The negative prognostic effect of DM following contemporary PCI is heightened in the presence of insulin treatment, compared to non-DM patients. Focus on secondary prevention, prescription of and adherence to optimal medical therapy is necessary for post-PCI risk reduction.",

        "Abstract":"BACKGROUND: The NORSTENT trial randomized 9,013 patients to percutaneous coronary intervention (PCI) with a drug-eluting stent (DES) or bare-metal stent (BMS) with 5-year follow-up. No difference was found in the composite primary outcome of death from any cause and nonfatal spontaneous myocardial infarction after a median of 5 years of follow-up. Secondary outcomes included repeat revascularizations, which were reduced by DES. We report the occurrence of target lesion revascularization (TLR) in time and across demographic and clinical subgroups in patients with lesions in native coronary arteries (n = 8,782).\nRESULTS: Clinically driven TLR was performed on 488 (5.6%) of the 8,782 patients during 5 years of follow-up. Male gender, older age, visible thrombus in the lesion, and larger stent diameter were associated with less TLR; multivessel disease and longer stents were associated with a higher risk of TLR. There was a substantial and highly significant reduction of the risk of any TLR after 5 years in the DES group (hazard ratio [HR] 0.44, 95% confidence interval [CI] 0.36-0.52], p < 0.001). The effect of DES on TLR was limited in time to the first 2 years in the study with no evidence of a later rebound effect. The reduction in TLR after DES insertion was consistent across subgroups defined by gender, age, diabetes status, renal function, and lesion and stent characteristics. The number needed to treat with DES (vs. BMS) to prevent 1 TLR ranged from 4 to 110 across clinically relevant subgroups.\nCONCLUSION: DES have a time-limited effect on the rate of TLR, but with a substantial and highly significant reduction in the first 2 years after the procedure. This effect was found to be consistent across all important clinical subgroups.",

        "Abstract":"Tranexamic acid (TxA) reduces perioperative blood transfusion in cardiac surgery; however, the optimal dose of TxA remains unknown. METHODS AND RESULTS: This large-scale, double-blind, randomized controlled trial with a 1-year follow-up enrolls patients undergoing elective cardiac surgery with cardiopulmonary bypass. Patients are randomly assigned 1:1 into either the high-dose TxA group (intravenous bolus [30 mg\/kg] after anesthesia followed by intravenous maintenance [16 mg\/kg\/h] throughout the operation, and a pump prime dose of 2 mg\/kg) or the low-dose TxA group (intravenous bolus and maintenance are 10 mg\/kg and 2 mg\/kg\/h, respectively, and a pump prime dose of 1 mg\/kg). The primary efficacy end point is the rate of perioperative allogeneic red blood cell (RBC) transfusion defined as the number (%) of patients who will receive at least 1 RBC unit from operation day to discharge. The primary safety end point is the 30-day rate of the composite of perioperative seizures, renal dysfunction, myocardial infarction, ischemic stroke, deep vein thrombosis, pulmonary embolism, and all-cause mortality. The secondary end points are perioperative allogeneic RBC transfusion volume, the non-RBC blood transfusion rate, postoperative bleeding, reoperation rate, mechanical ventilation duration, intensive care unit stay, hospital length of stay, total hospitalization cost, each component of composite primary safety end point, and the 6-month\/1-year follow-up mortality and morbidity. We estimated a sample size of 3,008 participants. CONCLUSIONS: The study is designed to identify a TxA dose with maximal efficacy and minimal complications.

It has traditionally been a prized Chinese folk medicine for the human well-being. However, the actions of cordycepin against renal ischemia\/reperfusion injury (I\/R) are still unknown. In the present study, rats were subject to I\/R and cordycepin was intragastrically administered for seven consecutive days before surgery to investigate the effects and mechanisms of cordycepin against renal I\/R injury. The test results of kidney and peripheral blood samples of experimental animals showed that cordycepin significantly decreased serum blood urea nitrogen and creatinine levels and markedly attenuated cell injury. Mechanistic studies showed that cordycepin significantly regulated inflammation, apoptosis, and oxidative stress. These data provide new insights for investigating the natural product with the nephroprotective effect against I\/R, which should be developed as a new therapeutic agent for the treatment of I\/R in the future.",

The prognostic impact of not receiving five guideline-recommended therapies is poorly described.\nAIM: To ascertain the prognostic significance of suboptimal pharmacotherapy in ACS survivors.\nMETHODS: Consecutive patients with ACS from the Melbourne Interventional Group registry who were alive at 30 days following their index percutaneous coronary intervention were included. Patients were divided into three categories based on the number of secondary prevention medications prescribed. The optimal medical therapy (OMT), near-optimal medical therapy (NMT), suboptimal medical therapy (SMT) groups were prescribed 5, 4 and ≤ 3 medications, respectively. Primary endpoint was long-term mortality. Cox-proportional hazard modelling was undertaken to assess independent predictors of survival.\nRESULTS: Of the 9375 patients included, 5678 (60.6%) received OMT, 2903 (31.0%) received NMT and 794 (8.5%) received SMT. Patients receiving SMT were older, more likely to be female and had higher burden of comorbidities (renal impairment, congestive heart failure, diabetes, peripheral vascular disease; P < 0.01 for all). SMT was associated with higher long-term mortality at 3.9 ± 2.2 years when compared to NMT and OMT (16.8% vs 10.5% vs 8.2%, P < 0.001). Compared to OMT, SMT was an independent predictor of long-term mortality (hazard ratio, HR 1.62, 95% confidence interval, CI 1.30-2.02, P < 0.01) while NMT was associated with a clinically significant 14% mortality hazard (HR 1.14, 95% CI 0.97-1.34, P = 0.11).\nCONCLUSIONS: There is a graded long-term hazard associated with not receiving OMT after an ACS. Improvements in secondary prevention pharmacotherapy models of care are warranted to further decrease the long-term mortality.",

The elevated hs-TnT group had a significantly higher rate of any coronary lesion (in-stent restenosis and de novo lesions) in follow-up CAG (coronary angiography) than the non-elevated group (28.6% vs. 10.3%, p < 0.05). Multivariate analysis also showed that hs-TnT elevation was independently associated with the presence of significant coronary stenosis in the chronic phase (odds ratio: 3.99, 95% confidence interval: 1.38 to 11.53). The best cut-off value of the hs-TnT level at 9 months after a successful PCI to predict the presence of significant coronary stenosis was 0.016 ng\/ml (sensitivity: 50.0%; specificity: 82.1%; area under the receiver operating characteristic curve: 0.67).\nCONCLUSIONS: hs-TnT elevation was independently associated with the presence of coronary stenosis in the chronic phase in SAP patients with successful PCI. Routine measurement of hs-TnT in the chronic phase may be useful to refine the risk of patients after PCI.",

        "Abstract":"BACKGROUND: To evaluate the rates of limb salvage, survival, and perioperative mortality in patients with acute limb ischemia (ALI) submitted to endovascular revascularization with pharmacomechanical thrombectomy (PMT) and catheter-directed thrombolysis (CDT).\nMETHODS: This was a retrospective consecutive cohort study of patients with ALI who were submitted to endovascular treatment with PMT or fibrinolysis at the Division of Vascular and Endovascular Surgery, Hospital do Servidor Público Estadual (São Paulo, Brazil), between July 2015 and December 2018. The limb salvage rate and survival rate at 720 days were analyzed in both the PMT (group 1) and CDT treatment (group 2), as well as the perioperative mortality rate (PMR) at 30 days after surgery.\nRESULTS: One hundred twelve patients were admitted to the emergency department with ALI between July 2015 and December 2018. Seventeen patients diagnosed with Rutherford III irreversible ALI and 46 patients submitted to open surgery were excluded. Thus, 49 patients were submitted to endovascular surgery; 18 (36.7%) were classified into group 1, and 31 (63.3%) were classified into group 2. The clinical data were equal between the 2 groups, but there was a higher prevalence of thrombophilia in group 1 (3 cases; P < 0.001). The limb salvage rate and the overall survival rate at 720 days were similar between groups 1 and 2 (87.8% vs. 89.7%, P = 0.78 and 84.7% vs. 69.2%, P = 0.82, respectively). There was no statistical difference regarding secondary patency rates at 720 days between groups 1 and 2 (group 1, 81.9% and group 2, 78.8%; P = 0.66). The PMR was 16.7% (8 patients) within the first 30 days. Group 2 had a higher overall mortality rate (OMR) (6 patients, 19.3%, P = 0.03). Regarding the PMT group, there was a higher rate of complications such as myoglobinuria, hematuria, acute renal failure, and death in the subgroup of patients in whom there were performed more than 150 cycles\/sec during the surgery (P < 0.001).\nCONCLUSIONS: In the present study, the PMT and CDT endovascular procedures had similar limb salvage, overall survival, and secondary patency rates. However, the OMR was higher in the CDT group. Another important finding was related to the number of cycles\/sec performed in the PMT group, in whom patients with more than 150 cycles\/sec have presented with higher rates of hematuria, myoglobinuria, acute renal failure, and death.",

        "Abstract":"BACKGROUND AND AIM: Recurrent atherothrombotic events have been reported in certain higher risk subsets of patients even with ticagrelor, a potent first-line antiplatelet agent for the management of patients with acute coronary syndrome (ACS). Hyperhomocysteinemia is a known determinant of platelet function abnormalities. Therefore, the aim of our study was to evaluate the impact of homocysteine (Hcy) levels on platelet reactivity in patients receiving Ticagrelor.\nMETHODS AND RESULTS: Patients with ACS undergoing percutaneous coronary revascularization and on dual antiplatelet therapy with ASA + Ticagrelor (90mg\/twice a day) were scheduled for platelet function assessment 30-90 days post-discharge. Aggregation tests were performed by Multiple Electrode Aggregometry (MEA). Suboptimal platelet inhibition HRPR-high residual platelet reactivity was defined if above the lower limit of normality (417 AU*min). We included 432 patients, divided according to Hcy tertiles. Higher Hcy levels were associated with age, renal failure, creatinine levels and use diuretics (p < 0.001). Patients with higher Hcy levels displayed a higher platelet reactivity at COL test (p = 0.002), and ADP test (p = 0.04), with a linear relationship between Hcy and platelet aggregation after stimulation with collagen (r = 0.202, p < 0.001), thrombin receptor peptide (r = 0.104, p = 0.05) and ADP (r = 0.145, p = 0.006). However, Hcy levels did not significantly affect the rate of HRPR with Ticagrelor (9.9% vs 13.7% vs 10.7%, p = 0.89; adjusted OR [95% CI] = [0.616-1.51], p = 0.99).\nCONCLUSIONS: Among patients with ACS, despite the elevated platelet reactivity associated to hyperhomocysteinemia, DAPT with ticagrelor could overcome such phenomenon, achieving an adequate platelet inhibition in the majority of the patients.",

This study investigated the long-term clinical outcomes associated with long-term DAPT after LMCA bifurcation stenting. Using data from the multicenter KOMATE and COBIS registries, we analyzed 1,142 patients who received a drug-eluting stent for a LMCA bifurcation lesion and who experienced no adverse events for 12 months after the index procedure. Patients were divided into 2 groups: DAPT >12 months (n = 769) and DAPT ≤12 months (n = 373). The primary end point was major adverse cardiovascular events (MACEs), as a composite of cardiac death, myocardial infarction, stroke, and stent thrombosis, over 5 years of follow-up. We further performed propensity score adjustment for clinical outcomes. DAPT >12 months afforded a lower MACE rate than DAPT ≤12 months (2.3% vs 5.4%, adjusted hazard ratio [HR] 0.37; 95% confidence interval [CI] 0.19 to 0.71; p = 0.003). The use of DAPT for >12 months was an independent predictor of a reduced likelihood of MACEs (HR 0.34; 95% CI 0.17 to 0.67; p = 0.002). A DAPT score ≥2, chronic kidney disease, and age >75 years were significant independent predictors of MACEs. In subgroup analysis, the use of DAPT for >12 months consistently resulted in better clinical outcomes across all subgroups, especially among patients with ACS, compared with the use of DAPT for ≤12 months. In conclusion, an extended duration of DAPT reduces MACE rates after LMCA bifurcation stenting.",

Those with acute coronary syndrome (ACS) are at high risk for myocardial infarction (MI) if not treated with dual antiplatelet therapy (DAPT). We sought to assess pre and post-operative outcomes of patients maintained on Clopidogrel and aspirin up to the time of surgery and compare them with those on aspirin alone.\nMETHODS: From the cardiac surgery database, 240 patients were retrospectively registered between January and May 2017. There were 126 patients with ACS who underwent CABG on DAPT (Clopidogrel group [CG]) and 114 patients who underwent elective CABG on aspirin alone (control). The CG received intraoperative prophylactic platelet transfusion (PPT). Demographics, comorbidities, and laboratory data were prospectively entered at the time of surgery and were subsequently retrieved for analysis. Per and postoperative findings were identified and compared between both groups.\nRESULTS: The cohort consisted of 240 patients (mean age 61 years, 81.3% were male, SD ± 9.58). Patients in the CG were younger (Median 57 vs. 63, P-value 0.001), and with male predominance (86% versus 75%, P-value 0.028). In addition, they had less prevalence for diabetes and renal failure as compared to control (P-values 0.003, and 0.005, respectively). There were no significant differences between both groups in number of vessels grafts, duration of on-pump and aortic clamp. Hematologic laboratory data had also similar baseline values. The CG had similar bleeding rate, redo surgery and in-hospital death (P-values non-significant), however more infection and total hospital stay as compared to control (p-values 0.048 and 0.001).\nCONCLUSION: Patients who are at increased risk for MI can be maintained on DAPT up to the time of CABG because surgery is safe when patients are offered PPT.",

ISR clinical presentation was classified as acute coronary syndrome (ACS) or non-ACS. Clinical, angiographic features and 1-year outcomes [composite of death, myocardial infarction (MI) and repeat-target lesion revascularization] for these two groups were compared. The mean age of study population was 61 ± 10 years and 81.2% were males. ACS was the dominant clinical presentation mode occurring in 118 (61.8%) patients. MI was seen in 66 (34.6%) patients.

NICE guidelines and the British National Formulary advise the discontinuation of metformin before surgery. The drug manufacturer's datasheet advises the withdrawal of metformin 48 h before surgery. However, the data regarding perioperative use of metformin is scarce.\nAIMS: To evaluate the effect of continuation of metformin till night before surgery on lactate levels in patients undergoing coronary artery bypass graft (CABG) surgery.\nMATERIALS AND METHODS: In this prospective cohort study, 1,800 consecutive patients who underwent CABG between 1 November 2015 and 31 October 2016 were enrolled. Following exclusion criteria, a total of 790 subjects were included for final analysis. Three-hundred and eight seven (48.9%) patients with diabetes received metformin till night before surgery (Met group), 239 (30.3%) patients with diabetes were non-metformin users (Non-Met group), and 164 (20.8%) patients were having no diabetes (Non-Diab group). Lactate levels and arterial pH were measured using arterial blood gas machine. Postoperative morbidity outcome data were obtained by collecting clinical data, routine biochemistry, and chest imaging.\nRESULTS: The mean metformin dose was 1,124.6 mg\/day (SD: 509.3; range: 500-2,500 mg\/day). Mean postoperative lactate levels were 1.91 ± 0.7 in Met group, 2.04 ± 0.79 in Non-Met group, and 2.07 ± 0.78 in Non-Diab group.

Of the cohort, 93% were receiving hemodialysis and 7% on peritoneal dialysis. We analyzed trends and investigated clinical factors associated with specific P2Y12-I prescribed.\nRESULTS: Clopidogrel was prescribed for 95%, prasugrel for 3%, and ticagrelor for 2%. Clopidogrel was favored for those ≥75 years (18% of cohort). Compared to Caucasians, African Americans (36% of cohort) and Hispanics (19% of cohort) were less likely to receive prasugrel and ticagrelor (P<0.05). Patients receiving hemodialysis versus peritoneal dialysis were less likely to receive prasugrel over clopidogrel, adjusted odds ratio (aOR) 0.67 (0.55-0.82). Each additional year of dialysis decreased the odds of receiving prasugrel over clopidogrel, aOR 0.91 (0.85-0.98). History of atrial fibrillation reduced the odds of receiving ticagrelor or prasugrel over clopidogrel, aOR 0.69 (0.54-0.89) and 0.73 (0.60-0.89), respectively. Concomitant oral anticoagulant use was not associated with choice of P2Y12-I. Occurrence of non-ST segment elevation myocardial infarction or percutaneous coronary intervention within the 6-month period prior to the index date favored ticagrelor over prasugrel, aOR 1.31 (1.06-1.62) and 1.29 (1.01-1.66), respectively. However, prescribing trends favoring ticagrelor over prasugrel were not observed for deployment of drug-eluting, or multiple coronary stents.\nCONCLUSION: Between 2011 and 2014, clopidogrel remained the most common P2Y12-I whereas ticagrelor and prasugrel remained underutilized in ESRD patients. Prescribing practices for these drugs were based upon clinically approved indication for their use in the general population as well as perceived complexity of an ESRD patient including demographics, dialysis-related factors and comorbidities. Comparative effectiveness studies involving ESRD patients are needed to prove that ticagrelor and prasugrel are just as safe and effective as clopidogrel before clinicians can make informed decisions for choice of P2Y12-I in this patient population.",

There is little knowledge in the literature about differences in CTO-PCI between diabetic and nondiabetic patients in the era of third-generation drug-eluting stents (DESs). In this study, we analyzed the impact of diabetes mellitus (DM) on procedural characteristics, complications, and acute outcomes in a cohort of 440 patients.  Between 2012 and 2016, we recruited 440 consecutive patients, 116 of them with DM. All the patients underwent PCI for at least 1 CTO. Antegrade and retrograde CTO recanalization techniques were applied. Only third-generation DESs were used. We used t-tests and the Pearson chi-quadrat test to test the significant differences in the variables between the 2 groups.  The patients with DM were older than the nondiabetics (64.5 y vs. 61.1 y; P=0.003), and they suffered more frequently from a chronic kidney disease (7.1% vs. 2.4%; P=0.001). The nondiabetics less frequently had arterial hypertension (75.3% vs. 89.7%; P=0.001); however, they more often had a family liability for CAD (32.1% vs. 22.4%; P=0.050) and had a higher left ventricular ejection fraction (59.2% vs. 56.7%; P=0.011). The success rate was 85.2% in the patients without DM and 81.2% in the patients with DM (P=0.403). The existence of DM had no impact on the procedural success and complication rates.  Our study on 440 patients shows that diabetics and nondiabetics have similar success and complication rates after the recanalization of CTOs using third-generation DESs.

        "Abstract":"ETHNOPHARMACOLOGICAL RELEVANCE: Fufang Chuanxiong capsule consists of Angelica sinensis radix and Chuanxiong rhizome, which are used in the traditional Chinese medicine for the treatment of coronary artery disease, and Xinyue capsule is composed of panax quinquefolius saponin extracted from leaves and stems of Panax quinquefolium L, which has the functions of anti-myocardial ischemia, improving myocardial energy metabolism and inhibiting apoptosis of cardiomyocytes.\nOBJECTIVE: To observe the role of Chinese herbal medicines in the cardiovascular outcome among patients with acute coronary syndrome (ACS) and renal insufficiency after percutaneous coronary intervention (PCI).\nMETHODS: The subjects came from the 5C trial (chictr.org number: chictr-trc-07000021), post-PCI patients suffered from ACS with mild-to-moderate renal insufficiency (30 mL•min•1.73 m < estimated glomerular filtration rate≤89 mL•min•1.73 m) included. The study population consisted of 215 subjects in the control group who were treated with western medicine standard therapy, and 211 subjects in the treatment group who were treated with Chinese herbal medicines (Fufang Chuanxiong Capsule and Xinyue Capsule) for 6 months on the basis of western medicine standard therapy. All were followed for 1 year. The primary endpoint included the composite of cardiac death, nonfatal recurrent myocardial infarction, and ischemia-driven revascularization. Secondary endpoint included the composite of stroke, congestive heart failure, and readmission for ACS. The serum creatinine and estimated glomerular filtration rate (eGFR) were evaluated.\nRESULTS: After 1 year follow-up of two groups, there were 16 cases of primary endpoint in the control group and 6 cases of primary endpoint in the treatment group [absolute risk reduction (ARR): 0.046, 95%CI: 0.004-0.088; relative risk (RR): 0.38, 95%CI: 0.15-0.96, P = 0.040]. There were 15 cases of secondary endpoint in the control group and 5 cases of secondary endpoint in the treatment (ARR: 0.041, 95%CI: 0.006-0.086; RR: 0.34, 95%CI: 0.13-0.92, P = 0.033). The eGFR in the treatment group was significantly higher than that in the control group (75.19 ± 16.74 mL min·1.73 m VS 72.03 ± 14.96 mL min·1.73 m, P < 0.05). The eGFR in the treatment group was significantly higher after the intervention with Chinese herbal medicines than that before intervention (72.27 ± 11.83 mL min·1.73 m VS 75.19 ± 16.74 mL min·1.73 m, P < 0.05).\nCONCLUSION: Chinese herbal medicines plus western medicine standard therapy improved clinical outcomes in patients with ACS and mild-to-moderate renal insufficiency. Additionally, this study also demonstrated Chinese herbal medicines were useful in deferring decline of renal function.",

        "Abstract":": Intravascular administration of iodinated contrast media is an essential tool for the imaging of blood vessels and cardiac chambers, as well as for percutaneous coronary and structural interventions. Along with the spreading of diagnostic and interventional procedures, the increasing incidence of contrast-induced nephropathy (CIN) has become an important and prognostically relevant problem. CIN is thought to be largely dependent on oxidative damage, and is a considerable cause of renal failure, being associated with prolonged hospitalization and significant morbidity\/mortality. The most effective treatment strategy of this serious complication remains prevention, and several preventive measures have been extensively investigated in the last few years.Preprocedural hydration is the best-known and mostly accepted strategy. The administration of sodium bicarbonate has controversial effects, and is likely to be ineffective when the infused dose is unable to achieve adequate urine alkalinization. Since alkaline pH suppresses the production of free radicals, increasing urine pH would be an attractive goal for CIN prevention.In a prospective randomized controlled, open-label clinical trial we will test the hypothesis that urine alkalinization with either oral or intravenous bicarbonate on top of hydration alone is the main determinant of CIN prevention (primary endpoint) in a population of patients with moderate or severe chronic kidney disease scheduled for coronary angiography and\/or angioplasty. If we then demonstrate nonsignificant differences in urine alkalinization and incidence of CIN between the two bicarbonate groups (secondary endpoint), a practical implication will be that oral administration is preferable for practical reasons over the administration of intravenous bicarbonate.",

        "Abstract":"BACKGROUND: Chronic kidney disease (CKD) is associated with an increased risk of adverse cardiovascular outcomes, in patients with coronary artery disease (CAD) undergoing percutaneous coronary intervention (PCI). However, most studies used bare-metal stents or first-generation drug-eluting stents, and less guideline-directed therapy to reduce cardiovascular risk was reported in CKD patients. This study investigates the impact of moderate-CKD on patients undergoing PCI in the current era.\nMETHODS: Patient level data were pooled from 2 multicenter randomized trials (BIONICS and NIREUS trials) with a near \"all-comers\" design, comparing PCI with ridaforolimus-eluting stents vs. zotarolimus-eluting stents in patients with CAD. Patients were classified according to the presence or absence of moderate-CKD, defined as creatinine clearance (CrCl) <60 mL\/min. We compared baseline characteristics, angiographic findings, and clinical outcomes 1-year post-PCI.\nRESULTS: 236\/2,201 (10.7%) patients had CKD, mean CrCl of 50.3 + 7.8 mL\/min. These patients were generally older and more often with hypertension than non-CKD patients, but the use of guideline-directed therapy was similar between the groups. CKD was associated with an increased risk of cardiovascular death (hazard ratio [HR] 6.08; 95% CI 2.11-17.51; p < 0.001), but with a reduced occurrence of repeated revascularization, including ischemia-driven revascularization (HR 0.47; 95% CI 0.24-0.92; p < 0.05). The rate of repeated angiography per severe cardiovascular adverse event was significantly lower in the CKD than the non-CKD group (23\/38 [61%] vs. 253\/334 [76%], p < 0.05).\nCONCLUSIONS: Moderate-CKD in patients with CAD was associated with higher rates of all-cause and cardiovascular mortality, yet with a lower risk of revascularization 1-year following PCI. Lack of guideline-directed medical therapy does not explain the adverse outcome of CKD patients.",

The clinical characteristics were analyzed.  A total of 94 PAN patients were finally enrolled and 57 (60.64%) presented kidney manifestation. The mean age of onset was (37.76±17.40) years old and the interval from onset to diagnosis was 10 (0 to 240) months. Forty patients were misdiagnosed once or more times. In patients with renal involvement, 9 cases suffered from renal ischemia or infarction, 31 with microscopic haematuria, 26 with proteinuria, renal artery or its branch involved in 17 cases, renal vein thrombosis in 1 case, 4 cases with pyeloureterectasis, one case with renal fascia thickening, 33 cases with impaired renal function (serum creatinine>84 μmol\/L) including creatinine>140 μmol\/L in 10 patients. Renal artery branch stenosis was the most common presentation [9 cases (52.94%)] of renal vascular involvement, other abnormalities including nodular dilatation [4 cases (23.53%)], occlusion [3 cases (17.65%)].

        "Abstract":"A number of studies have reported on treatment outcomes of coronary stenting (PCI) for multivessel coronary artery diseases (MVD), and compared them with the conventional coronary artery bypass grafting (CABG). However, the clinical outcomes of robot-assisted CABG (R-CABG) in comparison with PCI in MVD patients have not been investigated.We recruited retrospectively MVD patients receiving R-CABG and PCI with drug-eluting stents for all vessels in one stage between January 2005 and December 2013 at our institution with at least 3 years of outcomes were retrospectively recruited and analyzed.A total of 638 MVD patients were studied. Among them, 281 received R-CABG, and 357 received PCI. Similar complete revascularizations were achieved in both groups (R-CABG: 40.2%, PCI: 41.5%, P = .751). The residual stenosis was 4.1 ± 4.4 in the R-CABG group, and comparably 3.5 ± 3.7 in the PCI group (P = .077). Patients in the R-CABG group were younger, with more severe coronary artery disease (CAD) and had more background risk factors. The in-hospital and long-term mortalities as well as the incidence of TLR, myocardial infarction (MI), stroke were all similar between groups. But the incidence of TVR and any revascularization were lower in the R-CABG group. The long-term mortality was predicted by age, left ventricular ejection fraction, and chronic kidney disease, but not by the revascularization modality, completeness of revascularization, nor residual SYNTAX scores. The last 3 factors were not predictors of long-term TLR, TVR, MI, and stroke.The in-hospital and long-term survival rates of MVD were similar for both the R-CABG and PCI groups. But the R-CABG group had rates of TVR and any revascularization lower than PCI. Revascularization modality, completeness of revascularization, and residual SYNTAX scores were not predictors of in-hospital and long-term mortalities, MI, and stroke in real-world practice. R-CABG was associated with lower rates of TLR and TVR, and is likely a safe and effective treatment and an alternative choice of PCI for MVD patients who have low surgical risks.",

        "Abstract":"Adverse effects have been reported in patients with preprocedural anemia after percutaneous coronary intervention (PCI), but data regarding the relation between elevated hemoglobin (Hb) level and post-PCI prognosis remain limited. This study assessed the impact of elevated Hb on major adverse cardiac and cerebrovascular event (MACCE) at 12 months, a composite of all-cause mortality, nonfatal myocardial infarction, and ischemic stroke after PCI. We pooled patient-level data from four Korean multicenter drug-eluting stent registries from 2010 to 2016. In total, 5,107 patients were divided into 5 categories according to the baseline Hb level (<10, 10 to 12.9, 13 to 14.9, 15 to 16.9 and ≥17 g\/dl). Patients with higher Hb levels were significantly younger, predominantly male, current smokers with higher body mass index, and more frequent dyslipidemia. Hypertension, diabetes, chronic kidney disease, and cerebrovascular accident were more prevalent in lower Hb groups. Categorically, a U-shaped curvilinear relation was observed between baseline Hb and clinical outcomes showing significantly higher MACCE rate in <10g\/dl (hazard ratio [HR], 4.62 [2.81 to 7.68]) and ≥17 g\/dl (HR, 4.06 [1.57 to 10.5]) groups compared with the reference group (13 to 14.9 g\/dl), especially in men. In nonanemic patients (Hb ≥13 g\/dl), adjusted HRs of MACCE, mortality, and stroke were significantly higher in ≥17 g\/dl group than in the reference group. Furthermore, ≥17 g\/dl was an independent predictor for MACCE and all-cause mortality after PCI. In conclusion, not only low Hb but also elevated Hb of ≥17 g\/dl was significantly associated with higher MACCE rates and all-cause mortality after PCI. An appropriate treatment strategy for patients with high Hb level should be identified through future studies.",

Kaplan-Meier curves of survival free from TLR were compared between the two groups. We also performed propensity score matching and then compared the two matched groups (n = 27 in each group). The acute procedure success rate was similar for the two groups (100% versus 99.1%, P = 0.56). The incidence of TLR was higher in the HD group than in the non-HD group (41.0% versus 9.6%, P < 0.0001).

        "Abstract":"Postoperative atrial fibrillation is the most common dysrhythmia to occur after coronary artery bypass graft surgery. It develops in 10% to 40% of patients and can lead to complications such as hemodynamic instability, heart failure, and stroke. Risk factors include hypertension, diabetes, chronic kidney disease, and obesity. Patients who experience postoperative atrial fibrillation often have longer hospital stays, are at higher risk for readmission, and have increased mortality. Protocols designed to reduce the incidence of the condition can decrease hospital costs, improve patient outcomes, and increase overall quality of care. This quality improvement project took place in a tertiary care center located in southeastern Michigan and focused on the development and implementation of an evidence-based postoperative atrial fibrillation prophylaxis protocol using amiodarone. The outcomes of this project suggest that amiodarone prophylaxis can reduce the incidence of postoperative atrial fibrillation in patients with no previous history of atrial fibrillation undergoing coronary artery bypass graft surgery.",

Risk of DTE or unplanned revascularization was similar to warfarin triple therapy for dabigatran 110 mg dual therapy across all CrCl categories. Dabigatran 150 mg dual therapy versus warfarin triple therapy had similar risk for DTE or unplanned revascularization in patients with CrCl 30 to <80 ml\/min and lower risk at CrCl ≥80 ml\/min (p for interaction = 0.02).\nCONCLUSIONS: In the RE-DUAL PCI trial, dabigatran dual therapy reduced bleeding events versus warfarin triple therapy irrespective of renal function, with overall similar risks of thromboembolic events but lower risks with dabigatran 150 mg in patients with normal CrCl.",

        "Abstract":"BACKGROUND: Invasive fungal infection (IFI) after liver transplant (LTx) is associated with extensive morbidity and mortality. Targeted prophylaxis reduces risk, but qualifying criteria, drug of choice and regimen are unclear and compliance is inconsistent.\nOBJECTIVE: Assess the impact of a risk factor-based fungal prophylaxis protocol (FPP) after LTx on fungal infection rates, fungal epidemiology, and transplant outcomes.\nMETHODS: Observational cohort study of adult LTx recipients between July 1, 2009, and June 30, 2017. Patients in the FPP group were given a set dose of 400 mg fluconazole without renal adjustment on POD 1-14 via pharmacist delegation protocol.\nRESULTS: One hundred and eighty-nine patients met inclusion criteria; 50 in the FPP and 139 in the pre-implementation comparator group. Of those who would be considered high-risk, 22.3% received antifungal prophylaxis prior to FPP implementation vs 92% after implementation (P < .0001). There were significantly fewer fungal infections in the FPP group at 1 year (12.5% vs 26.6%, P = .03). IFI in the pre-implementation control group was due to Candida species in 95% of cases; 30% were species with reduced fluconazole susceptibility. IFI in the FPP group was due to Candida species in all cases, and no isolates had reduced fluconazole susceptibility. Aspergillus did not account for any IFI between the groups. One-year patient and graft survival were similar between groups. In a multivariable model accounting for patient and donor age, donor type, MELD, and cold ischemic time, FPP was protective against fungal infection (HR 0.3, P = .015). FPP did not significantly impact graft survival (HR 0.4, P = .14), but trended toward improved patient survival. (HR 0.18, P = .06).\nCONCLUSION: Implementation of a targeted FPP utilizing static dosing of fluconazole 400 mg × 14 days to those that meet high-risk criteria significantly reduces invasive fungal infection after liver transplant. Use of this protocol did not adversely affect fungal epidemiology and may have a positive impact on allograft and patient survival. Future large prospective studies are needed to better evaluate survival impact.",

We aimed to evaluate the preventive effects of left ventricular end-diastolic pressure (LVEDP)-guided hydration for the prevention of CI-AKI in patients with chronic kidney disease undergoing cardiac catheterization.\nMETHODS: This prospective randomized single-blind clinical trial enrolled 114 eligible patients with an estimated glomerular filtration rate (eGFR) of 15 < eGFR ≤ 60 mL\/min\/1.73 m [according to the level-modified Modification of Diet in Renal Disease formula (MDRD)] and stable ischemic heart disease undergoing coronary procedures. The patients were randomly allocated 1:1 into the LVEDP-guided hydration group (n = 57) or the standard hydration group (n = 57). CI-AKI was defined as a greater than 25% or greater than 0.5 mg\/dL (44.2 mmol\/L) increase in the serum creatinine concentration compared with the baseline value. Hydration with 0.9% sodium chloride at a rate of 1 mL\/kg\/h (0.5 mL\/kg\/h if left ventricular ejection fraction < 40%) within 12 h was given to all the patients in both groups before the procedure.

        "Abstract":"2\nBackground Fractional flow reserve (FFR) and optical coherence tomography (OCT) may help both in assessment and in percutaneous coronary intervention optimization of angiographically intermediate coronary lesions. We designed a prospective trial comparing the clinical and economic outcomes associated with FFR or OCT in angiographically intermediate coronary lesions. Methods and Results Three hundred fifty patients with angiographically intermediate coronary lesions (n=446) were randomized to FFR or OCT guidance. In the FFR arm, percutaneous coronary intervention was performed if FFR was ≤0.80 aiming for a postprocedure FFR >0.90. In the OCT arm, percutaneous coronary intervention was performed if percentage of area stenosis was ≥75% or 50% to 75% with minimal lumen area <2.5 mm or plaque ulceration. Costs, angina frequency, and major adverse cardiac events were assessed at 1 month and at 13 months. We present early data at 1 month consistent with a prespecified analysis of secondary end points. Patients randomized to FFR, as compared with OCT, were significantly more commonly managed with medical therapy alone (67.7% versus 41.1%; P<0.001), required less contrast media (245±137 versus 280±129 mL; P=0.004), and exhibited a lower occurrence of contrast-induced acute kidney injury (1.7% versus 8.6%; P=0.034). At 1 month, in comparison to FFR, OCT was associated with increased total costs (2831±1288 versus 4292±3844 euros\/patient; P<0.001) whereas occurrence of major adverse cardiac events or significant angina was similar. Conclusions In patients with angiographically intermediate coronary lesions, a functional guidance by FFR, as compared with OCT, increased the rate of patients treated with medical therapy alone. This translated into a significant reduction in administered contrast, contrast-induced acute kidney injury, and total costs at 1 month with FFR.

Safety analysis was performed retrospectively to assess the complication rate, hemorrhagic rate, and rate of ischemic events. There were no hemorrhages related to the VPS surgery.\nRESULTS: Nineteen subjects were included in the series. The patients received a total of 25 procedures that included 19 EVDs and 6 VPSs. Two patients (8.3%) developed small asymptomatic track hemorrhages after EVD placement. One patient developed a large retroperitoneal hemorrhage due to renal artery branch injury during procedure, and another patient developed an idiosyncratic transient thrombocytopenia which resolved after stopping the medication. One patient (4%) developed a transient ischemic attack, which resolved after a bolus of tirofiban.\nCONCLUSION: Our study suggests that long-term use of intravenous tirofiban monotherapy in aSAH subjects for endovascular SAC or FDD is safe in the perioperative setting.",

The primary outcome was the incidence of CI-AKI, and the secondary outcomes were the differences of serum creatinine (Scr), blood urea nitrogen (BUN), uric acid (UA), and estimated glomerular filtration rate (eGFR) levels between groups after contrast media exposure. We used fixed-effects or random-effects models according to I statistics. The meta-analytic procedures were completed by Review Manager, version 5.3.\nACHIEVEMENTS: Eight random controlled trials with 1141 patients were included for this analysis. Compared with the control, allopurinol was associated with a reduced risk of CI-AKI (Relatives Risk (RR) 0.39, 95% confidence interval [CI] 0.20,0.74, P = .004) and only a intend for decrease a post-procedure uric acid levels compared with the controlled ones at 48 hours (standardized mean difference (SMD) -0.72, 95% CI -1.44, 0.01, P = .05).

The anti-inflammatory and anti-thrombotic properties of vitamin D, in fact, could be even more beneficial among diabetics, where platelet hyperreactivity and suboptimal response to antiplatelet drugs has been associated with poorer outcomes. However, no study has so far evaluated the impact of vitamin D levels on platelet reactivity and high-on treatment platelet reactivity (HRPR) among diabetic patients receiving dial antiplatelet therapy (DAPT).\nMETHODS: Our population is represented by a consecutive cohort ofdiabetic patients treated with DAPT (ASA + clopidogrel or ticagrelor or dose-adjusted prasugrel) for an acute coronary syndrome or elective PCI, undergoing platelet reactivity assessment at 30-90 days post-discharge. Aggregation was assessed by multiple-electrode aggregometry. HRPR was defined for values above the lower limit of normality (in non-treated patients).\nRESULTS: We included 440 patients, that were divided according to quartiles values of vitamin D (< 9.4; 9.4-15.59; 15.6-21.64; ≥ 21.65 ng\/ml). Among them, 31 were excluded as chronically treated with vitamin D supplementation. Lower vitamin D quartiles were associated with more advanced age (p = 0.01), female gender (p = 0.04), renal failure (p = 0.005), history of previous MI (p = 0.01), CABG and use of diuretics (p = 0.003), severe coronary disease (p = 0.002), but lower ejection fraction (p = 0.001), treatment with statins (p = 0.04) and new ADP-antagonists (p = 0.002). Vitamin D levels related with higher HbA1c (p = 0.001), cholesterol (p = 0.02) and creatinine (p = 0.004) and lower hemoglobin (p = 0.004). The prevalence of HRPR with ASA was low and not related to vitamin D quartiles (3.4% vs 2.7% vs 1.8% vs 2.1%, p = 0.44; adjusted OR[95%CI] = 1.16[0.60-2.26], p = 0.67).

There were 290 LDCL interventions with the use of newer generation drug‑eluting stents (DESs; cobalt chromium everolimus- or zotarolimus-eluting stents) performed between January 2013 and January 2016.\nRESULTS: The mean (SD) TSL was 55.5 (16.8) mm. The use of intravascular ultrasound \/ optical coherence tomography was 17.1%, rotablation, 6.9%, and noncompliant balloon, 88.9%. The median (range) follow‑up duration was 831 (390-1373) days. All‑cause mortality and cardiac death rates were 11.7% and 6.9%, respectively. The myocardial infarction (MI) rate was 6.6%, including target‑vessel MI in 4.1%. The rate of clinically‑driven repeat revascularization was 13.8%, and of definite or probable LDCL stent thrombosis, 7.2%. Overall patient‑oriented adverse event rate (any death, MI, or repeat revascularization) was 25.5%, and device‑oriented rate (cardiac death, target vessel‑MI, or target lesion restenosis), 13.4%. Adverse outcome predictors were chronic kidney disease, acute coronary syndrome as an indication for the procedure, chronic heart failure with reduced left ventricular ejection fraction, multivessel disease, and coexisting peripheral artery disease, but not lesion‑related factors, such as bifurcation, calcification, chronic total occlusion, or TSL.\nCONCLUSIONS: Adverse outcomes following contemporary LDCL management using newer generation DESs in routine clinical practice are associated with clinical patient characteristics rather than lesion characteristics or TSL. We identified high‑risk patient cohorts that may benefit from enhanced surveillance.",

        "Abstract":"BACKGROUND: Some studies suggest that black patients may have worse outcomes after drug-eluting stent (DES) placement. There are limited data characterizing long-term outcomes by race. The objective was to compare long-term outcomes between black and white patients after percutaneous coronary intervention (PCI) with DES implantation.\nMETHODS: We analyzed 915 black and 3,559 white (n = 4,474) consecutive patients who underwent DES placement at Duke University Medical Center from 2005 through 2013. Over 6-year follow up, we compared rates of myocardial infarction (MI), all-cause mortality, revascularization, and major bleeding between black and white patients. A multivariable Cox regression model was fit to adjust for potentially confounding variables. Dual-antiplatelet therapy use over time was determined by patient follow-up surveys and compared by race.\nRESULTS: Black patients were younger; were more often female; had higher body mass indexes; had more diabetes mellitus, hypertension, and renal disease; and had lower median household incomes than white patients (P < .001). At 6 years after DES placement, black relative to white patients had higher unadjusted rates of MI (12.1% vs 10.1%, hazard ratio 1.25, 95% CI 1.00-1.57, P = .05) and major bleeding (17.8% vs 14.3%, hazard ratio 1.28, 95% CI 1.07-1.54, P = .01), but there were no significant differences in other outcomes. After multivariable adjustment, there were no statistically significant racial differences in any of these outcomes at 6 years. Similarly, dual-antiplatelet therapy use was comparable between racial groups.\nCONCLUSIONS: Unadjusted rates of MI and major bleeding over long-term follow up were higher among black patients compared to white patients, but these differences may be explained by racial differences in comorbid disease.",

Oral hydration with water is inexpensive and it may be effective in the prevention of CI-AKI, but its efficacy among patients undergoing primary percutaneous coronary intervention (PCI) remains unknown.\nMETHODS\/DESIGN: Our study is a secondary analysis on the database from the ATTEMPT study. We enrolled ST-elevation myocardial infarction (STEMI) patients undergoing primary PCI. Eligible patients received peri-procedural aggressive (left ventricular end-diastolic pressure-guided) or routine (≤ 500 mL) intravenous hydration with an isotonic solution (0.9% NaCl) with randomization. The primary endpoint was CI-AKI, defined as a > 25% or 0.5 mg\/dL increase in serum creatinine from baseline during the first 48-72 h post-procedurally. All patients drank unrestricted amounts of fluids freely, the volume of which was recorded until 24 h following primary PCI. Oral hydration volume\/weight (OHV\/W) ratios were calculated. The association between post-procedural oral hydration (quartiles) and CI-AKI was assessed using multivariable analysis controlling for confounders, including intravenous hydration strategies.\nDISCUSSION: Our study determined the effects of post-procedural oral hydration on CI-AKI following primary PCI, which is a potential strategy for CI-AKI prevention among patients with STEMI at very high risk.\nTRIAL REGISTRATION: ClinicalTrials.gov, NCT02067195 .

        "Published":null,
        "Abstract":"AIMS: Acute kidney injury (AKI) is a common complication following transcatheter aortic valve implantation (TAVI) and is associated with increased risk for short- and long-term mortality. In patients undergoing percutaneous coronary intervention (PCI), forced diuresis with matched hydration has been shown to reduce the incidence of AKI by ∼50%. The aim of the present study was to evaluate whether forced diuresis with matched intravenous hydration reduces AKI in patients undergoing TAVI.\nMETHODS AND RESULTS: Reducing Acute Kidney Injury (REDUCE-AKI) was a single-centre, prospective, randomized, double-blind sham-controlled clinical trial, designed to examine the effect of an automated matched saline infusion with urine output for the prevention of AKI in patients undergoing TAVI. A total of 136 TAVI patients were randomized, 68 in each group. Mean age was 83.9 ± 5 years and 41.2% were males. There were no differences in baseline characteristics between the two groups. The rate of AKI was not statistically different between the groups (25% in the active group vs. 19.1% in the sham group, P = 0.408). There was a significant increase in long-term mortality in the active group (27.9% vs. 13. 2% HR 3.744, 95% CI 1.51-9.28; P = 0.004). The study was terminated prematurely by the Data Safety Monitoring Board for futility and a possible signal of harm.\nCONCLUSIONS: Unlike in PCI, forced diuresis with matched hydration does not prevent AKI in patients undergoing TAVI, and might be associated with increased long-term mortality. Future studies should focus on understanding the mechanisms behind these findings.\nCLINICALTRIALS.GOV REGISTRATION: NCT01866800, 30 April 2013.",

However, routine IVUS guidance in patients with CKD remains controversial.\nMETHODS: CKD was defined as an estimated glomerular filtration rate (eGFR) <60 mL min 1.73 m . The primary end point was target vessel failure (TVF) at 12 months, including cardiac death, target vessel myocardial infarction, and clinically driven target vessel revascularization.\nRESULTS: eGFR was available in 1,443 patients, of whom 723 were in the IVUS guidance group, and 720 were in the angiography guidance group. Finally, CKD was present in 349 (24.2%) patients. At 12 months, TVF in the CKD group was 7.2%, which was significantly higher than 3.2% in the non-CKD group (p = .001). Moreover, there were 25 TVFs in the CKD patients, with 7 (3.9%) TVFs in the IVUS group and 18 (10.7%) TVFs in the angiography group (hazard ratio [HR]: 0.35; 95% confidence interval [CI]: 0.15-0.84; p = .01), whereas 35 TVFs occurred in patients without CKD, with 14 (2.6%) TVFs in the IVUS group and 21 (3.8%) TVFs in the angiography group (HR: 0.67; 95% CI: 0.34-1.32; p = .25; p for interaction = .24).\nCONCLUSIONS: This study demonstrated that CKD patients undergoing DES implantations were associated with a higher risk of TVF at 12 months.

        "Abstract":"Advanced age and diabetes represent summative conditions in the determination of cardiovascular risk, and especially for the management of dual antiplatelet therapy (DAPT), often requiring balancing between bleeding and thrombotic complications. However, few studies have so far evaluated the impact of age on platelet reactivity and suboptimal platelet inhibition (high-on treatment platelet reactivity-HRPR) on DAPT among diabetic patients, that was, therefore the aim of the present study. In diabetic patients treated with DAPT (ASA + clopidogrel or ticagrelor) platelet reactivity was assessed at 30-90 days post-discharge for an acute coronary syndrome or elective PCI. Aggregation was assessed by multiple-electrode aggregometry. HRPR was defined for values above the lower limit of normality (in non-treated patients). Elderly patients were considered ≥ 75 years of age. We included 462 patients, among them 149 (32.2%) were ≥ 75 years. Elderly patients were more often females (p = 0.006), with lower body size (p = 0.04), acute coronary syndrome at presentation and renal failure (p < 0.001), non-smokers (p = 0.002), in therapy with insulin (p = 0.02) and diuretics (p < 0.001) and lower rate of betablockers (p = 0.02). Age directly related with C reactive protein (p = 0.01), creatinine levels and inversely with hemoglobin (p < 0.001) and triglycerides (p = 0.003). No association was found at linear regression analysis for platelet reactivity and age with different activating stimuli, but for ASPI test (r = 0.12; p = 0.03). No significant difference in HAPR was found in elderly patients (2.4 vs. 3.2%, p = 0.76, OR[95% CI] = 0.45[0.1-2.11], p = 0.31). HRPR for ADP antagonists was similarly not affected by age (30.1% vs. 35.7%, p = 0.28, adjusted OR[95% CI] = 0.78[0.47-1.29], p = 0.33). Comparable results were obtained when considering separately the DAPT strategies with clopidogrel or ticagrelor, or when adjusting our results according to propensity score values. Among diabetic patients receiving dual antiplatelet therapy for an acute coronary syndrome or elective percutaneous coronary intervention, age does not affect platelet reactivity or the rate of high-on treatment platelet reactivity. Similar results were obtained for ASA and clopidogrel or ticagrelor.",

After excluding in-hospital mortality cases (n = 79), we categorized patients into two groups based on the average SBP (SBP) at the outpatient clinic: mean SBP 120 mmHg or less (n = 290) and mean SBP greater than 120 mmHg (n = 641). Primary endpoint was major adverse cardiovascular and cerebrovascular events (MACCEs), defined as cardiac death, myocardial infarction, repeat target vessel revascularization, or stroke. Propensity score matching was performed to adjust for differences in baseline clinical variables. Median follow-up duration was 77.7 (36.6-87.3) months.\nRESULTS: The mean SBP greater than 120 mmHg had higher prevalence of cardiovascular risk factors, such as diabetes (38.4 vs. 27.2%, P = 0.001), hypertension (58.8 vs. 32.4%, P < 0.001), and chronic kidney disease (3.3 vs. 1.0%, P = 0.043) than mean SBP 120 mmHg or less.

The absolute risk of dose reduction was presented as cumulative incidence both overall and according to baseline characteristics. Moreover, to assess baseline comorbidities related to dose reduction, adjusted Cox regression models were used. In subgroup analysis, we investigated dose reduction following acute myocardial infarction and\/or percutaneous coronary intervention (MI\/PCI), chronic kidney disease (CKD), turned 80 years, intracranial hemorrhage, peripheral bleeding, ischemic stroke, cancer, bone fracture, and antiplatelet treatment start.\nRESULTS: Of 24,489 patients included, 12.2% experienced dose reduction during the study period. Dabigatran treatment, higher age at inclusion, high CHADS-VASc score, and high HAS-BLED score were related to higher risk of dose reduction.

We compared baseline characteristics, social determinants of health, and 1-year outcomes in female African Americans (AA) and Hispanic\/Latinas (HL) versus white women after coronary everolimus-eluting stent implantation in all-comer patients. Methods and Results We pooled 1863 women from the PLATINUM Diversity (n=1057 women) and PROMUS ELEMENT PLUS (n=806 women) postapproval studies, with some overlap in study sites. Social determinants of health data were only available for PLATINUM Diversity. The primary end point was 1-year major adverse cardiac events (death, myocardial infarction, or target vessel revascularization). Outcomes were risk adjusted using multivariate Cox regression. The study sample comprised 1417 white (76.1%, reference group), 296 AA (15.9%), and 107 HL (5.7%) women. AA were older, and both AA and HL had more diabetes mellitus and hypertension than white women. AA had larger reference vessel diameters but less lesion calcification, whereas HL had less lesion tortuosity but more calcification. Compared with white women, there was a trend toward higher unadjusted 1-year major adverse cardiac events in AA (12.0% versus 8.0%; P=0.06) but similar rates in HL (11.0% versus 8.0%; P=0.32), and after risk adjustment, there were no differences (AA women: hazard ratio, 1.47; 95% CI, 1.00-2.17; HL women: hazard ratio, 1.33; 95% CI, 0.71-2.44). AA had a 3-fold higher adjusted risk of 1-year myocardial infarction (hazard ratio, 3.45; 95% CI, 1.72-7.14; P=0.01) and increased risk of target vessel revascularization (hazard ratio, 1.82; 95% CI, 1.10-2.94; P=0.02). Independent predictors of major adverse cardiac events included renal disease, prior myocardial infarction, silent ischemia, history of stroke, and multivessel disease. Conclusions Race and ethnicity confer heterogeneity in women undergoing everolimus-eluting stent implantation. Despite more comorbidities and less favorable social determinants of health, AA and HL women have similar 1-year major adverse cardiac events to white women, although AA women seem to have a higher risk of 1-year myocardial infarction.

Results were pooled using a random-effect model or a fixed-effect model according to the heterogeneity.\nRESULTS: Five RCTs with 1,367 patients undergoing coronary angiography (CAG) or percutaneous coronary intervention (PCI) were included. Meta-analysis indicated that probucol in addition to periprocedural hydration significantly reduced the incidence of CI-AKI (risk ratio (RR): 0.37, 95% confidence interval (CI): 0.24 - 0.56, p < 0.001) with insignificant heterogeneity (I = 0%). Moreover, treatment with probucol significantly lowered the increment of serum creatinine (weighted mean difference (WMD): -0.04 mg\/dL, 95% CI: -0.07 to -0.02 mg\/dL, p < 0.001) and preserved the loss of estimated glomerular filtrating rate (WMD: 2.46 mL\/min, 95% CI: 0.84 - 4.07 mL\/min, p = 0.003) as compared with control treatment.

Finally, preoperative β-blocker use was associated with longer postoperative intensive care unit stays (45.2 vs 47.0 hours; P = .001), but clinically similar hospital length of stay.\nCONCLUSIONS: Preoperative β-blocker administration is not associated with improved outcomes after AVR but instead is associated with increased postoperative morbidity. Routinely initiating preoperative β-blockade is not supported in patients undergoing AVR.",

From January 2013 to December 2013, 9 769 consecutive patients underwent selective PCI in Fuwai Hospital were retrospectively included in this study. Patients were divided into two groups, including non-post-PCI anticoagulant therapy group and low-dose and short-time post-PCI anticoagulant therapy group (enoxaparin 0.4 ml\/12 h or fondaparinux 2.5 mg\/day by subcutaneous injection for 2-3 days after PCI). All patients were evaluated at 30 days, 180 days and 12 months for major adverse coronary and cerebral events (MACCE) including all-cause death, myocardial infarction, revascularization and stroke as well as in-stent thrombosis and bleeding events. Data from 1 755 pairs of patients were analysis after propensity score matching. The clinical outcomes were compared between groups by using Kaplan-Meier survival analysis before and after propensity score matching. Multivariable Cox analysis was used to define the impact and determinants of post-PCI anticoagulation on clinical outcomes.  one thousand seven hundred and fifty-five (18.0%) patients didn't receive post-PCI anticoagulation and 8 014 (82.0%) patients received post-PCI anticoagulation, 5 666 (58.0%) patients received enoxaparin and 2 348 (24.0%) patients received fondaparinux. Patients were younger and incidence of female patients was less, incidence of renal dysfunction and acute coronary syndrome were higher in low-dose and short-time post-PCI anticoagulant therapy group than in non-post-PCI anticoagulation group (all 0.05). Similarly, patients with post-PCI anticoagulation were associated with more left main coronary artery lesion and branch lesion (0.05). Post-PCI anticoagulation patients were associated with less trans-femoral process, more drug-eluting stents implantation and less simple balloon dilatation (all 0.05). Nine thousand seven hundred and seventeen (99.5%) patients completed 2 years follow up. Post-PCI anticoagulation patients had significantly lower 30-day all-cause death (0.05% (4 cases) vs. 0.46% (8 cases), 0.001) and stroke (0 vs. 0.11% (2 cases), 0.003), lower 180-day all-cause death (0.17% (14 cases) vs. 0.57% (10 cases), 0.002), revascularization (2.07% (166 cases) vs. 3.71% (65 cases), 0.001) and MACCE (3.49% (280 cases) vs. 5.47% (96 cases), 0.001), lower 2-year revascularization (7.61% (610 cases) vs. 12.84% (225 cases), 0.001) and MACCE (10.92 (875 cases) vs. 16.01% (281 cases), 0.001). Multivariable Cox regression analysis showed that post-PCI anticoagulant therapy was an independent protective factor of 30-day (=0.17, 95 0.05-0.62, 0.007), 180-day all-cause death (=0.37, 95 0.16-0.87, 0.023) and MACCE (=0.74, 95 0.58-0.94, 0.013), 2-year MACCE (=0.71, 95 0.62-0.81, 0.001). After propensity score matching, post-PCI anticoagulation therapy remained as an independent protective factor of 30-day all-cause death (=0.11, 95 0.01-0.92, 0.042) and 2-year MACCE (=0.81, 95 0.68-0.96, 0.015).  Low-dose and short-time post-PCI anticoagulant therapy may decrease 30-day all-cause death, 180-day all-cause death and MACCE and 2-year MACCE, and meanwhile this option does not increase bleeding risk in patients underwent selective PCI.",

Little is known about the outcomes of lower extremity bypass (LEB) for peripheral arterial disease (PAD) in patients with a history of drug abuse disorder. The aim of this study is to evaluate the outcomes of LEB in this patient population.\nMETHODS: A retrospective study of the Premier Healthcare Database 2009-2015 was performed. In-hospital complications, mortality, and hospitalization costs were assessed in patients with a history of drug abuse disorder (opioids, cannabis, cocaine, sedatives\/hypnotics\/anxiolytics, and hallucinogens\/methamphetamine\/psychoactive drugs) who underwent LEB for PAD. Multivariable logistic and generalized linear models were utilized to study the association between drug use\/misuse and in-hospital outcomes after LEB.\nRESULTS: Our cohort included 50,976 patients, of which 967 (2%) had a history of drug abuse disorder on admission. The majority of drugs were cannabis (38.5%), followed by opioids (21.5%) and cocaine (14.5%). Patients with a history of drug use\/misuse were significantly at a higher risk of developing complications during their hospital stay (71.9% vs. 64.2%, P < 0.001) including acute renal failure (11.8% vs. 9.1%), stroke (1.6% vs. 0.6%), respiratory complications (pneumonia and respiratory failure) (15.0% vs. 9.6%), hemorrhage\/shock (36.2% vs. 31.8%), vascular or graft-related complications (29.8% vs. 26.4%), wound complications (9.1% vs. 6.3%), cellulitis (8.5% vs. 6.8%), and sepsis (2.1% vs. 1.2%, all P < 0.001). In addition, drug users were found to have higher risk of concomitant major amputations compared to nondrug users (2.0% vs. 0.9%, P < 0.001). On multivariable analysis, no difference was noted between the 2 groups in terms of in-hospital mortality and concomitant major amputations. However, drug use\/misuse was associated with 57% higher odds of overall in-hospital complications (odds ratio [OR] 1.57, 95% confidence interval [CI] 1.34-1.83, P < 0.001), a prolonged length of hospital stay (median: 7 days vs. 5 days in nonabusers, P < 0.001), and higher hospitalization costs compared to nonusers (adjusted mean difference: OR $3,075, 95% CI $2,096-$4,055, P < 0.001).\nCONCLUSIONS: Drug use\/misuse is significantly associated with increased odds of in-hospital complications, longer hospital stays, and higher hospitalization costs following LEB. Vascular surgeons need to pay special attention to this patient population and explore interventions to decrease the morbidity and economic burden associated with drug use.",

CKD patients were more likely to be older, be female, and have a history of heart failure. CKD subjects were more likely to experience a MACCE (adjusted hazard ratio [HR]: 1.48; 95% confidence interval [CI]: 1.28 to 1.71; p = 0.0001) during a median 4.5-year follow-up.

The study's primary outcome measurements assessed renal function. These assessments included duration of renal dysfunction, duration and severity of acute kidney injury (AKI), estimated glomerular filtration rate (eGFR) over time, urine output, and use of renal-replacement therapy. Complications and other measures of morbidity were also assessed.\nRESULTS: Sixty-nine patients (mean age 71.5 [standard deviation 9.2] years; 19 of 69 women) were enrolled and randomized. Patients received coronary artery bypass graft surgery (37\/69), valve surgery (24\/69), coronary artery bypass graft and valve surgery (6\/69), or other procedures (2\/69). Mean on-pump time was 268 [standard deviation 136] minutes. Duration of renal dysfunction did not differ between the groups (relative risk, 0.86; 95% confidence interval [CI], 0.19-3.79, P = .84). However, patients who received the amino acid infusion had a reduced duration of AKI (relative risk, 0.02; 95% CI, 0.005-0.11, P < .0001) and greater eGFR (+10.8%; 95% CI, 1.0%-20.8%, P = .033).

Although chronic kidney disease patients have both high ischemic and bleeding events, little is known about both risks during DAPT in hemodialysis (HD) patients.\nMETHODS: From July 2009 to March 2017, we retrospectively analyzed bleeding events and major adverse cardiac and cerebrovascular events (MACCE) in 644 consecutive patients who underwent successful percutaneous coronary intervention (PCI) with 2nd-DES implantation in our institution. We divided the patients into 2 groups [102 HD and 518 non-HD patients] after excluding 24 patients. The primary endpoint was bleeding events of Bleeding Academic Research Consortium (BARC) type 2, 3, or 5. The secondary endpoint was MACCE. We also investigated potential bleeding risk factors in those patients.\nRESULTS: At a median follow-up of 49 months, bleeding events occurred in 76 (12.3%) patients. Critical bleeding events of BARC type 3 or 5 occurred more frequently in HD (HD vs. non-HD: 16.7% vs. 7.1%; p=0.004). Most events tended to occur within 6 months post PCI.

Patients were categorized in preserved renal function and mild or moderate CKD groups depending on their eGFR (≥90, 89-60 and 59-30 mL\/min\/1.73 m2, respectively). The primary clinical endpoint, a composite of overall death and myocardial infarction, and its individual components were analyzed using proportional hazards regression (Clinical Trial registration information: http:\/\/www.controlled-trials.com.

Little is known about the role of preprocedural hydration on persistent RD in patients with chronic kidney disease [CKD; estimated glomerular filtration rate (eGFR) <60 mL\/min\/1.73 m] undergoing percutaneous coronary intervention (PCI). We therefore examined the use of preprocedural hydration to decrease the incidence of persistent RD. Methods Between 2012 and 2015, 1,230 consecutive patients undergoing PCI, except for patients with an eGFR ≥60 mL\/min\/1.73 m, on dialysis, having acute myocardial infarction, or recently having started renin-angiotensin inhibitors, were screened (n=333). Before their index PCI, the 12-h saline group (n=103) received 1 mL\/kg\/h 0.9% sodium chloride for 12 hours, and the 1-h bicarbonate group (n=63) received 3 mL\/kg 154 mEq\/L sodium bicarbonate for 1 hour. The control group (n=167) received no pre-procedural hydration. The study outcome of kidney function decline was investigated using the percent-change (%-change) of the calculated creatinine clearance between the baseline value and the lowest value recorded three to six months after index PCI. Results There was less renal function deterioration in the saline group than in the control group, and the bicarbonate group showed deterioration similar to the other groups (%-change; 12-h saline 2.0±11.3% vs. control -5.6±12.6%, p<0.001; vs. 1-h bicarbonate -1.8±14.1%, p=0.18; 1-h bicarbonate vs. control, p=0.14 ANOVA). A multiple regression analysis adjusted for risk factors for persistent RD showed that saline hydration correlated independently with a higher %-change (r=0.262, p<0.001).

        "Abstract":"BACKGROUND: Enhanced platelet reactivity represents one of the major determinants of cardiovascular risk among diabetic patients. The aim of the present study was to evaluate the impact of metformin use on platelet reactivity in diabetic patients receiving dual antiplatelet therapy (DAPT).\nMETHODS: We included diabetic patients treated with DAPT after an acute coronary syndrome or percutaneous coronary intervention. Platelet reactivity was assessed at 30-90 days by Multiple-electrode aggregometry. In an additional cohort of diabetic patients naïve to antiplatelet therapy, we assessed platelet reactivity by light transmission aggregometry, surface expression of P-selectin and plasma concentration of Thromboxane B2 (TxB2).\nRESULTS: We included 219 diabetic patients, 117 (53.4%) treated with metformin. Metformin was associated with younger age (p=0.03), male gender (p=0.02), lower rate of hypertension (p=0.04), active smoker (p=0.002), previous MI (p<0.001) renal failure (p<0.001), fibrinogen (p<0.001) and C-reactive protein (p=0.04), larger use of diuretics (p=0.04) calcium antagonists (p=0.05), better glycemic control (p<0.001) and higher haemoglobin (p=0.003). The prevalence of HAPR did not significantly differ according to hypoglycemic treatment (p=0.73; adjusted OR[95%CI]=5.63[0.42-76], p=0.19). Moreover, no impact of metformin was observed for HRPR (p=0.77; adjusted OR[95%CI]=1.15[0.55-2.4], p=0.71). Among an additional cohort of 42 diabetic patients naïve to antiplatelet therapy, we confirmed no impact of metformin or insulin on aggregation.\nCONCLUSIONS: Our study found no apparent association in diabetic patients treated with DAPT, between the use of metformin and platelet reactivity or the rate of HPR.",

        "Abstract":"Background Patients who have had an acute coronary syndrome ( ACS ) are at increased risk of recurrent cardiovascular events; however, paradoxically, high-risk patients who may derive the greatest benefit from guideline-recommended therapies are often undertreated. The aim of our study was to examine the management, clinical outcomes, and temporal trends of patients after ACS stratified by the Thrombolysis in Myocardial Infarction (TIMI) risk score for secondary prevention, a recently validated clinical tool that incorporates 9 clinical risk factors. Methods and Results Included were patients with ACS enrolled in the biennial Acute Coronary Syndrome Israeli Surveys ( ACSIS ) between 2008 and 2016. Patients were stratified by the TIMI risk score for secondary prevention to low (score 0-1), intermediate (2), or high (≥3) risk. Clinical outcomes included 30-day major adverse cardiac events (death, myocardial infarction, stroke, unstable angina, stent thrombosis, urgent revascularization) and 1-year mortality. Of 6827 ACS patients enrolled, 35% were low risk, 27% were intermediate risk, and 38% were high risk. Compared with the other risk groups, high-risk patients were older, were more commonly female, and had more renal dysfunction and heart failure ( P<0.001 for each). High-risk patients were treated less commonly with guideline-recommended therapies during hospitalization (percutaneous coronary intervention) and at discharge (statins, dual-antiplatelet therapy, cardiac rehabilitation). Overall, high-risk patients had higher rates of 30-day major adverse cardiac events (7.2% low, 8.2% intermediate, and 15.1% high risk; P<0.001) and 1-year mortality (1.9%, 4.6%, and 15.8%, respectively; P<0.001). Over the past decade, utilization of guideline-recommended therapies has increased among all risk groups; however, the rate of 30-day major adverse cardiac events has significantly decreased among patients at high risk but not among patients at low and intermediate risk. Similarly, the 1-year mortality rate has decreased numerically only among high-risk patients. Conclusions Despite an improvement in the management of high-risk ACS patients, they are still undertreated with guideline-recommended therapies. Nevertheless, the outcome of high-risk patients after ACS has significantly improved in the past decade, thus they should not be denied these therapies.",

        "Abstract":"OBJECTIVES: To investigate the prevalence, predictors and associations between guideline-directed medical therapy (GDMT) and clinical outcomes in acute myocardial infarction (AMI) patients undergoing percutaneous coronary intervention (PCI) from eight academic centers in the United States.\nBACKGROUND: Evidence for GDMT in patients with AMI comes from randomized controlled trials. The use of GDMT in clinical practice is unknown in this setting.\nMETHODS: PROMETHEUS is a multicenter observational registry comprising 19,914 patients with acute coronary syndrome (ACS) undergoing PCI. Patients with AMI were divided into two groups based on the prescription of GDMT or not (non-GDMT) at discharge. GDMT was defined according to American College of Cardiology\/American Heart Association (ACC\/AHA) class I recommendations, specifically, dual antiplatelet therapy, statin and beta-blocker for all AMI patients, and additional ACEI\/ARB in patients with left ventricular ejection fraction (LVEF) less than 40%, hypertension, diabetes mellitus (DM) or chronic kidney disease (CKD). The primary endpoint was major adverse cardiovascular events (MACE) defined as a composite of all-cause death, MI, stroke or unplanned target vessel revascularization (TVR) at 1 year.\nRESULTS: Out of 4,834 patients with AMI, 3,356 (69.4%) patients were discharged on GDMT. Patients receiving GDMT were more often younger and male. Compared with non-GDMT patients, GDMT patients had a significantly lower frequency of comorbidities. Predictors of greater GDMT prescription at discharge were ST-segment elevation myocardial infarction (STEMI), and increased body mass index (BMI), whereas hypertension, prior PCI, anemia and CKD were associated with less GDMT prescription. At 1 year, the use of GDMT was associated with a significantly lower incidence of MACE (13.7% vs. 22.5%; adjusted HR 0.68; 95%CI 0.58-0.80; P < 0.001), death (3.7% vs. 9.4%; adjusted HR 0.61; 95%CI 0.46-0.80; P < 0.001), and unplanned TVR (8.4% vs. 11.3%; adjusted HR 0.76; 95%CI 0.61-0.96; P = 0.020). However, there were no significant differences in the incidence of MI (4.3% vs. 7.0%; adjusted HR 0.75; 95%CI 0.56-1.01; P = 0.056), stroke (1.5% vs. 2.0%; adjusted HR 0.79; 95%CI 0.47-1.34; P = 0.384) between the two groups.\nCONCLUSION: In a contemporary practice setting in the United States, GDMT was utilized in just over two-thirds of AMI patients undergoing PCI. Predictors of GDMT prescription at discharge included STEMI, BMI and absence of hypertension, CKD, anemia or prior PCI. Use of GDMT was associated with significantly lower risk of 1-year MACE and mortality.",

        "Published":null,
        "Abstract":"CONTEXT AND AIMS: Off-pump coronary artery bypass graft (OPCABG) is a form of CABG surgery. It is performed without the use of cardiopulmonary bypass machine as a surgical treatment for coronary heart disease. Acute kidney injury (AKI) is one of the common postoperative complications of OPCABG. Previous studies suggest important differences related to intravenous fluid (IVF) chloride content and renal function. We hypothesize that perioperative use of chloride restricted IVFs may decrease incidence and severity of postoperative AKI in patients undergoing OPCABG.\nMETHODS: Six hundred patients were randomly divided into two groups of 300 each. In Group A (n = 300), chloride liberal IVFs, namely, hydroxyethyl starch (130\/0.4) in 0.9% normal saline (Voluven), 0.9% normal saline, and Ringer's lactate were used for perioperative fluid management. In Group B (n = 300), chloride-restricted IVFs, namely, hydroxyethyl starch (130\/0.4) in balanced colloid solution (Volulyte) and balanced salt crystalloid solution (PlasmaLyte A), were used for perioperative fluid management. Serum creatinine values were taken preoperatively, postoperatively at 24 h and at 48 h. Postoperative AKI was determined by AKI network (AKIN) criteria.\nRESULTS: In Group A, 9.2% patients and in Group B 4.6% patients developed Stage-I AKI determined by AKIN criteria which was statistically significant (P < 0.05).\nCONCLUSION: Perioperative use of chloride restricted IVF was found to decrease incidence of postoperative AKI. The use of chloride liberal IVF was associated with hyperchloremic metabolic acidosis.",

These endothelial progenitor cells can quickly mature into normal endothelium, providing rapid endothelialization.\nMETHODS: The MASCOT (Multinational Abluminal Sirolimus Coated biO-engineered stenT) (N = 2,614, 61 global sites) and REMEDEE (Randomized study to Evaluate the safety and effectiveness of an abluMinal sirolimus coatED bio-Engineered StEnt Post Market Registry) (N = 1,000, 9 European sites) registries are 2 prospective, multicenter studies evaluating clinical outcomes after attempted COMBO stent placement in all-comer patients undergoing percutaneous coronary intervention. In this patient-level pooled analysis we analyzed 1-year target lesion failure (TLF), a composite of cardiac death, target vessel myocardial infarction, or clinically driven target lesion revascularization. Furthermore, we determined predictors of 1-year TLF.\nRESULTS: A total of 3,614 patients (63.5 ± 11.2 years of age; 23.8% women) were included in this analysis. The prevalence of diabetes mellitus was 29.3%, and 54.3% patients presented with acute coronary syndrome. The primary endpoint of 1-year TLF occurred in 140 (3.9%) patients, with incidence of cardiac death in 1.6%, target vessel myocardial infarction in 1.2%, clinically driven target lesion revascularization in 2.2%, and definite stent thrombosis in 0.5% patients. Insulin-treated diabetes mellitus, chronic renal failure, and American College of Cardiology\/American Heart Association lesion type B2\/C were independent predictors of 1-year TLF.\nCONCLUSIONS: In this large patient-level pooled analysis of patients treated with the dual-therapy COMBO stent excellent results at 1-year were observed.

        "Abstract":"[{'i': 'Purpose:'}, {'i': 'Methods:'}, {'i': 'Results:'}, {'i': 'Conclusion:'}]\nStudies have revealed that patients with chronic kidney disease (CKD) are more susceptible to adverse effects of percutaneous coronary intervention (PCI). In addition, the role of elevated high sensitive C-reactive protein (hs-CRP) in the prediction of adverse cardiac outcomes after coronary stent implantation has already been shown. Therefore, in this study, we aimed to evaluate the effect of omega-3 supplementation on hs-CRP and 30-day major adverse cardiac events (MACE) in patients with CKD undergoing elective PCI.  In this randomized trial, 80 CKD patients who were candidates for elective PCI, were randomly assigned to two groups; the first group received a single dose of omega-3 (2500 mg, 12 h before PCI) as well as the standard drug regimen of PCI and the second group received placebo plus the standard therapy (325 mg loading dose of aspirin, 600 mg loading dose of clopidogrel, and weight-adjusted intravenous heparin). Hs-CRP levels were measured at baseline and 24 h after the intervention as a primary endpoint. The secondary endpoint was the incidence of MACE over a 30-day period after PCI.  Omega-3 did not significantly decrease post-PCI serum level of hs-CRP; however, the overall 30-day MACE was significantly lower in the omega-3 group compared to the control group (p=0.05).  Our results revealed the positive effect of the omega-3 supplement on decreasing 30-day MACE; hence, omega-3 may be considered as an effective adjunctive therapy to the standard drug regimen used before PCI. The evaluation of the effect of omega-3 on long-term MACE is recommended for future studies.",

        "Abstract":"PURPOSE: We aimed to report a single center's experience on endovascular treatment of true renal artery aneurysms (TRAAs), including treatment techniques and outcomes.\nMETHODS: This retrospective study was designed to evaluate the treatment and follow-up of TRAAs treated by a variety of endovascular interventional techniques over a period of 6 years. Six patients with nine TRAAs were identified; seven of the TRAAs were treated using different combinations of coil embolization and flow diverter stents. The clinical findings, aneurysm characteristics, endovascular methods and treatment outcomes were reported.\nRESULTS: Seven TRAAs of six patients were treated, with a median aneurysm size of 20 mm. Three TRAAs were treated with primary sac occlusion (one with primary coil embolization, one with balloon and stent assisted coil and glue embolization, and one with amplatzer vascular occlusion device and coil embolization). The remaining four TRAAs of three patients were treated with flow diverter stents (Cardiatis, Silk, Pipeline, and Surpass). Immediate clinical success was achieved in patients treated with primary sac embolization (95% CI, 29.2%-100%). Among patients treated with flow diverter stents, one patient required an additional flow diverter at 6-month follow-up. The occlusion time in flow diverters ranged from 1 month to 12 months (median, 3.5 months) taking the repeat procedure into account. In patients treated with flow diverters, the clinical success rate was 100% (95% CI, 29.2%-100%) at one-year follow-up. Long-term follow-up ranged from 3 to 52 months. One intraprocedural complication was encountered with a flow diverter during deployment, which required additional stenting and tirofiban infusion. No other major complication was seen.\nCONCLUSION: Endovascular treatment is an effective and safe method offering high success rates and low morbidity in the treatment of TRAAs and may supplant surgery as the primary therapy. Current experience in the use of flow diverter stents in TRAAs is limited to individual case reports with one brand of flow diverter device. Our small numbered series of four TRAAs shows our experience regarding endovascular treatment with different flow diverter brands.",

        "Abstract":"INTRODUCTION: Prolonged dual anti-platelet therapy (DAPT) is undesirable in certain patients. The biolimus-A9 drug-coated stent (BA9-DCS) has a rapid drug-elution profile allowing shortened DAPT.\nMETHODS: The demographics, procedural data, and clinical outcomes for 505 patients presenting with an ACS to three UK centres and treated with a BA9-DCS stent (PCI-DCS) were collected, and compared to a consecutive ACS cohort of unselected patients treated in the same period with drug-eluting stents (PCI-DES).\nRESULTS: PCI-DCS patients were older, more often female with hypertension, chronic kidney disease, severe LV dysfunction, and peripheral vascular disease more frequent than the PCI-DES cohort. PCI-DCS patients had a much higher Mehran bleed risk score (21.5 ± 7.7 vs. 15.9 ± 7.7, P < 0.0001). Baseline disease burden was greater in the PCI-DCS cohort with more left main and three vessel disease. During PCI, more stents (1.91 ± 1.1 vs. 1.57 ± 0.94, P < 0.0001), total stent length (38.2 ± 20.8 vs. 31.4 ± 20.3, P < 0.0001) and longer stents (38.2 ± 20.8 vs. 31.4 ± 20.3 mm, P < 0.0001) were used in the PCI-DCS cohort with rotational atherectomy also used more frequently. Physician-recommended DAPT duration was 2.9 ± 3.9 months for PCI-DCS patients and 11.3 ± 2.4 months for PCI-DES patients (P < 0.0001). At 12-month follow-up, definite stent thrombosis (0.6% vs. 1.1%) and TLR (3.2% vs. 2.7%) rates were similar between the two groups. After adjustment for baseline differences, there were no statistically significant differences in death and combined MACE rates at 12 months.\nCONCLUSIONS: The outcomes of patients treated with polymer-free BA9 drug-coated stent who present with an ACS and who were deemed unsuitable for prolonged DAPT are encouraging.

Limitations of current studies include a general ack of advanced CKD patients in major randomized controlled trials, of evidence on algorithm implementation, and of robust assessment tools for hemorrhagic risk. Herein, we aim to analyze the ESC Update recommendations and the newly implemented risk scores (DAPT, PRECISE-DAPT, PARIS) from the point of view of CKD, providing suggestions on drug choice (which combination has the best evidence), dosage, and duration (the same or different as for non-CKD population) of antithrombotics, as well as to identify current shortcomings and to envision directions of future research.\nCONCLUSION: We provide an evidence-based perspective on the new proposed bleeding management protocol, with focus on the CKD population. Despite previous important steps on antithrombotic therapy of renal patients, there remain many unsolved questions for which our suggestions could fundament new randomized controlled trials and specific protocols.",

        "Abstract":"BACKGROUND: While extended dual antiplatelet therapy (DAPT) with aspirin and a platelet (P2Y) inhibitor after percutaneous coronary intervention (PCI) reduces the risk of stent thrombosis (ST) and myocardial infarction (MI), it also increases bleeding. Newer generation drug-eluting stents with bioabsorbable polymer coatings may reduce thrombotic events and allow abbreviated DAPT in selected patients. The EVOLVE Short DAPT study is designed to evaluate the safety of 3-month DAPT in high bleeding risk subjects treated with the SYNERGY bioabsorbable polymer everolimus-eluting stent.\nTRIAL DESIGN: EVOLVE Short DAPT is a prospective, single-arm, international study that enrolled 2009 high risk bleeding subjects (defined as age ≥75 years, chronic anticoagulation, major bleeding within 12 months, history of stroke, renal insufficiency\/failure, or thrombocytopenia) who underwent PCI with the SYNERGY stent. Subjects presenting with acute MI or complex lesions were excluded. After 3 months treatment with DAPT (except those on anticoagulant in whom aspirin is optional), subjects free from stroke, MI, revascularization or ST will be eligible to discontinue P2Y inhibitor, but continue aspirin. Co-primary endpoints assessed between 3-15 months are: i) death\/MI compared for non-inferiority with propensity-adjusted historical group receiving 12-month DAPT, and ii) definite\/probable ST compared to a performance goal. The secondary endpoint is the rate of bleeding in subjects not receiving chronic anticoagulation compared for superiority against a propensity-adjusted historical control.\nCONCLUSION: The EVOLVE Short DAPT study will prospectively define the safety of DAPT discontinuation at 3 months in high bleeding risk patients treated with the SYNERGY stent.",

These patients may suffer from metabolic bone diseases, severe atherosclerosis, and undesirable cardiovascular events. Endoscopic parathyroidectomy with autotransplantation is a treatment option for those who do not respond to clinical management. This study aimed to investigate practical use of a self-made device in parathyroid autotransplantation for patients with sHPT, and to compare this device with ordinary surgical scissors.\nMETHODS: A total of 15 patients with sHPT were treated with endoscopic parathyroidectomy and autotransplantation. Pieces of parathyroid tissue were squeezed in our self-made device and injected into the brachioradialis muscle. Sixteen patients with sHPT who were treated with traditional parathyroid transplantation served as controls. Serum levels of parathyroid hormone, alkaline phosphatase, calcium, phosphorus and intact parathyroid hormone were measured before and after surgery.\nRESULTS: Preoperative symptoms were alleviated, and serum parathyroid hormone and alkaline phosphatase levels, hyperphosphatemia, and hypercalcemia were improved or normalized in all of the patients in both groups. Pathological examinations showed that parathyroid cells remained active.\nCONCLUSION: Application of our squeezing device is an economic, effective, and safe method in endoscopic parathyroidectomy and autotransplantation for patients with sHPT.",

        "Abstract":"OBJECTIVE: Acute limb ischemia is a common vascular emergency requiring immediate intervention. Thrombolysis has been widely utilized for acute limb ischemia; the purpose of this study is to analyze contemporary trends, outcomes and complications of thrombolysis for acute limb ischemia.\nMETHODS: Patients were identified from the Nationwide Inpatient Sample (2003-2013) using ICD-9. Patients undergoing emergency thrombolysis for acute limb ischemia were evaluated. Three groups were analyzed: thrombolysis alone, thrombolysis and endovascular procedure (T+ENDO), and failed thrombolysis requiring open surgery (T+OPEN).\nRESULTS: A total of 162,240 patients with acute limb ischemia were estimated: 33,615 patients (20.7%) underwent thrombolysis as the initial treatment. Mean age was 66.2 ± 34.9 years with 54% male. The utilization of thrombolysis increased significantly during the study period (16.8-24.2%, p < 0.0001). The most common group was thrombolysis and endovascular procedure (40.7%), followed by thrombolysis alone (34.1%), and T+OPEN (25.2%). Thrombolysis and endovascular procedure increased significantly over time (31.6-47.8%, p < 0.0001) whereas thrombolysis alone and T+OPEN significantly decreased (39.6-28.6% and 28.7-23.6%, respectively, p < 0.0001). Overall mortality was 4.9%; thrombolysis and endovascular procedure compared to thrombolysis alone and T-OPEN had a lower mortality rate (3.2% vs. 6.1% and 5.9%, p < 0001). The overall stroke rate was 1.9%; thrombolysis alone had the highest stroke rate (3.0%, p < 0.0001) with thrombolysis and endovascular procedure the lowest (1.2%) and T+OPEN 1.7%. The highest amputation rate was T+OPEN (11.6%, p < 0.001) compared to thrombolysis and endovascular procedure (5.1%) and thrombolysis alone (5.3%). T+OPEN had the highest incidence of cardiac (5.5%), respiratory (7.3%) and renal complications (12.5%), pneumonia (4.0%), and fasciotomy (16.8%) (all p < 0.0001).\nCONCLUSION: Thrombolysis remains an effective treatment for acute limb ischemia with increased utilization over time. There was a significant increase in thrombolysis and endovascular procedure leading to improved outcomes. Thrombolysis alone carried the highest mortality and stroke rate, with T+OPEN associated with the highest amputation and complications. Although thrombolysis is effective, 25% of patients required an open procedure suggesting that patient selection for thrombolysis first instead of open surgery continues to be a clinical challenge.",

Prior trials comparing a strategy of optimal medical therapy (OMT) with or without revascularization have largely excluded patients with advanced CKD. Whether a routine invasive approach when compared with a conservative strategy is beneficial in such patients is unknown.\nMETHODS: ISCHEMIA-CKD is a National Heart, Lung, and Blood Institute-funded randomized trial designed to determine the comparative effectiveness of an initial invasive strategy (cardiac catheterization and optimal revascularization [percutaneous coronary intervention or coronary artery bypass graft surgery, if suitable] plus OMT) versus a conservative strategy (OMT alone, with cardiac catheterization and revascularization [percutaneous coronary intervention or coronary artery bypass graft surgery, if suitable] reserved for failure of OMT) on long-term clinical outcomes in 777 patients with advanced CKD (defined as those with estimated glomerular filtration rate <30 mL\/min\/1.73m or on dialysis) and moderate or severe ischemia on stress testing. Participants were randomized in a 1:1 fashion to the invasive or a conservative strategy. The primary end point is a composite of death or nonfatal myocardial infarction. Major secondary endpoints are a composite of death, nonfatal myocardial infarction, hospitalization for unstable angina, hospitalization for heart failure, or resuscitated cardiac arrest; angina control; and disease-specific quality of life. Safety outcomes such as initiation of maintenance dialysis and a composite of initiation of maintenance dialysis or death will be reported. The trial is projected to have 80% power to detect a 22% to 24% reduction in the primary composite end point with the invasive strategy when compared with the conservative strategy.\nCONCLUSIONS: ISCHEMIA-CKD will determine whether an initial invasive management strategy improves clinical outcomes when added to OMT in patients with advanced CKD and stable ischemic heart disease.",

In such patients, whether utilization of different generations of drug-eluting stents (DES) for IR or CR affect long-term major adverse cardiovascular events (MACE) is unknown. This study included 702 NSTEMI patients with MVD who received first-generation (1G) or second-generation (2G) DES. In multivariable analysis, chronic kidney disease, chronic total, 1G DES and IR were independent predictors of long-term MACE. In patients receiving 1G DES, no significant differences of MACE were observed between the IR and CR groups (39.1% vs. 36.2%, p = 0.854). However, in patients receiving 2G DES, significantly fewer MACE were observed in the CR group than in the IR group (3.7% vs. 10.2%, p = 0.002). Compared with patients receiving 1G DES for IR, those receiving 2G DES for IR and CR exhibited significantly lower risk of MACE (59% and 83% lower, respectively). CR could not provide clinical benefits over IR in NSTEMI patients with MVD receiving 1G DES. However, in patients receiving 2G DES, compared with IR, CR was associated with a lower risk of long-term MACE, which was mainly caused by low rates of non-TLR and any revascularization.",

        "Abstract":"BACKGROUND: Hypothyroidism has been known to be associated with hyperlipidemia, endothelial dysfunction and atherosclerosis. Elevation of thyroid-stimulation hormone (TSH) is a gold standard to detect these conditions. However, no large studies have investigated the association between TSH elevation and long-term clinical outcomes in patients with acute myocardial infarction (AMI).\nHYPOTHESIS: Hypothyroidism is associated with higher mortality in patients with AMI.\nMETHODS: A total of 4748 AMI patients undergoing percutaneous coronary intervention (PCI) with drug-eluting stents were consecutively enrolled. We analyzed 1977 patients whose thyroid function data available after the exclusion of hyperthyroidism and possible central hypothyroidism. Patients were divided into two groups; euthyroid group (n = 1846) with normal TSH and normal free thyroxine (FT4); hypothyroidism group (n = 131) with elevated TSH and normal or low FT4. The two groups were subsequently compared with their all-cause and cardiac mortalities.\nRESULTS: Median follow-up duration was 3.5 years. Hypothyroidism group were older, included in more females, and had higher incidences of atrial fibrillation, stroke, and renal dysfunction. Elevated TSH was associated with significantly higher all-cause mortality (26.0% vs 11.7%, P < 0.0001) and cardiac mortality (9.2% vs 4.6%, P = 0.014). The multivariate Cox proportional hazards model identified that TSH elevation was a significant predictor of all-cause mortality (adjusted hazard ratio 1.560, 95% confidence interval 1.017 to 2.392, P = 0.041).\nCONCLUSIONS: Our data suggest that AMI patients with TSH elevation had worse clinical outcome.

The AVERT system alters the coronary injection pressure profile by diverting contrast away from the patient during coronary injection.\nMETHODS: The AVERT trial was a prospective, multicenter, 1:1 randomized clinical trial in 578 subjects with either baseline estimated glomerular filtration rate 20 to 30 ml\/min\/1.73 m or estimated glomerular filtration rate 30 to 60 ml\/min\/1.73 m and at least 2 additional risk factors for CI-AKI. Patients undergoing coronary angiography with planned or possible percutaneous coronary intervention (PCI) were randomized to hydration plus the AVERT system (n = 292) or hydration only (n = 286). The primary effectiveness endpoints were: 1) the total CMV used; and 2) the incidence of CI-AKI, defined as a ≥0.3 mg\/dl increase in serum creatinine within 5 days post-procedure.\nRESULTS: Patient demographics were well balanced between the groups, with mean baseline serum creatinine of 1.6 ± 0.4 mg\/dl and 64.9% patients with diabetes mellitus. PCI was performed in 42.2% of procedures, with coronary angiography in the remainder. Use of AVERT resulted in a 15.5% relative reduction in CMV overall (85.6 ± 50.5 ml vs. 101.3 ± 71.1 ml; p = 0.02) and a 22.8% relative reduction in CMV among PCI patients (114 ± 55 ml vs. 147 ± 81 ml; p = 0.001). The maximum relative reduction in CMV was 46% (124 ± 48 ml vs. 232 ± 97 ml; p = 0.01) when ≥3 lesions were treated. There were no differences in the rates of CI-AKI (27.0% vs. 26.6%; p = 0.70) between the study groups.\nCONCLUSIONS: Use of the AVERT system was feasible and safe, with acceptable image quality during coronary angiography and PCI. AVERT significantly reduced CMV, with the extent of CMV reduction correlating with procedural complexity. No significant differences in CI-AKI were observed with AVERT in this trial.

Clinical data of 59 MI patients received intestinal stomas at Jinling Hospital, Nanjing University School of Medicine from January 2010 to June 2017 were analyzed retrospectively. There were 41 male and 18 female patients aging of (51±14) years (ranging from 20 to 86 years). All the patients were divided to two groups according to the degree of bowel ischemia: acute MI group (AMI, bowel necrosis, =43) and chronic MI group (CMI, bowel stricture, =16). The medium time from onset to consult of AMI was 7(12) days (()) and the time of CMI was 80(51) days.

This study investigates the course of liver allografts from multiorgan donors enrolled in the randomized dopamine trial between 2004 and 2007 (clinicaltrials.gov identifier: NCT00115115). There were 264 hemodynamically stable DBDs who were randomly assigned to receive low-dose dopamine. Dopamine was infused at 4 μg\/kg\/minute for a median duration of 6.0 hours (interquartile range, 4.4-7.5 hours). We assessed the outcomes of 212 liver transplantations (LTs) performed at 32 European centers. Donors and recipients of both groups were very similar in baseline characteristics. Pretransplant laboratory Model for End-Stage Liver Disease score was not different in recipients of a dopamine-treated versus untreated graft (18 ± 8 versus 20 ± 8; P = 0.12). Mean cold ischemia time was 10.6 ± 2.9 versus 10.1 ± 2.8 hours (P = 0.24). No differences occurred in biopsy-proven rejection episodes (14.4% versus 15.7%; P = 0.85), requirement of hemofiltration (27.9% versus 31.5%; P = 0.65), the need for early retransplantation (5.8% versus 6.5%; P > 0.99), the incidence of primary nonfunction (7.7% versus 8.3%; P > 0.99), and in-hospital mortality (15.4% versus 14.8%; P > 0.99).

Some patients cannot undergo attempted revascularization because of contraindications, and they only receive conservative treatment. In this study, we investigate the comorbidities and survival rates of patients with CLI who receive conservative treatment. Thirty-five patients with CLI due to ASO, who had not undergone revascularization surgery (C group), were enrolled. As controls, 136 patients with CLI due to ASO who did undergo revascularization (R group), mainly via bypass surgery, were enrolled. Coronary artery disease, heart failure, and respiratory dysfunction were factors indicating conservative treatment. Limb salvage rates and survival rates were not significantly different between the two groups. Patients who had survived for less than two years after surgery had a higher prevalence of chronic heart failure, cardiovascular disease, and end-stage renal disease compared to patients who had survived for more than two years. The use of statins, dual antiplatelets, aspirin, or warfarin did not influence whether a patient survived for longer than two years. 77% of patients survived for more than two years after receiving only conservative therapies. Surgical revascularization did not improve the prognosis of patients with CLI as compared with the conservative therapy.

Although the prevalence of HPR was numerically lower on prasugrel therapy compared with clopidogrel therapy before and after switching, the differences did not reach a statistical significance (57.6% vs. 75.7% vs. 74.2%, p=0.13). Even under prasugrel treatment, more than half of patients showed HPR.\nCONCLUSIONS: Although low-dose prasugrel had somewhat better antiplatelet effect than clopidogrel, it could not significantly improve the prevalence of HPR in Japanese HD patients. Higher doses of prasugrel might be needed to achieve adequate platelet inhibition in this high thrombotic risk population.",

        "Abstract":"Few studies have described glucose metabolism in the immediate posttransplant period. Here, we report a 37-year-old female patient who had transient hypoglycemia after combined pancreas and kidney transplant for poorly controlled type 1 diabetes and renal failure. Although the patient's blood sugar decreased from 420 to less than 120 mg\/dL and the kidney demonstrated graft function immediately posttransplant, at 19 hours after transplant, the patient's blood glucose decreased to below the normal range at a nadir of 59 mg\/dL. When treated with intravenous dextrose, her blood glucose levels increased over 7 hours to 119 mg\/dL but then again declined, appearing to follow a circadian rhythm, with hypoglycemia shown during early morning hours and then improving during the afternoon. This prompted treatment with a continuous infusion of 5% dextrose on day 2, resulting in blood sugar levels returning to normal by day 4 and discharge on day 6. She has since remained euglycemic. The differential diagnosis of hypoglycemia immediately after kidney-pancreas transplant is wide. Indeed, after we excluded ischemia-reperfusion injury, impaired renal clearance, insulin-associated antibodies, and lack of pancreatic innervation, we believe that cause was most likely due to impairment of early glucose counterregulatory responses or delayed alpha cell function.",

        "Abstract":"Prasugrel and ticagrelor are recommended over clopidogrel in patients with ST-elevation myocardial infarction (STEMI). In this registry analysis, we compared efficacy and safety of ticagrelor and prasugrel P2Y12 inhibition in patients with STEMI. We included 318 patients in this single-center analysis. Twelve-month follow-up was conducted during ambulatory care at our department. Patients were on dual antiplatelet therapy with aspirin and ticagrelor or prasugrel during the follow-up period. Prescription of prasugrel or ticagrelor, respectively, was according to the preference of the treating physician. Major adverse cardiac and cerebrovascular events (MACCE) [death, myocardial infarction (MI), stroke, and unplanned reintervention] and thrombolysis in myocardial infarction (TIMI) bleeding (major\/minor) were registered during hospitalization and follow-up. TIMI bleeding events were more frequent in ticagrelor-treated patients [17 vs. 5 patients, hazard ratio (HR) 2.85, 95% confidence interval (CI) 1.2-6.6; log-rank P value = 0.01]. Prasugrel-treated patients were significantly younger (ticagrelor 63 ± 12 years vs. prasugrel 57 ± 10; P < 0.0001). Besides that, patients' characteristics were similar in both groups. Multivariate analysis revealed that ticagrelor medication was independently associated with bleeding risk after adjustment for age, percutaneous coronary intervention approach (femoral vs. radial), diabetes mellitus, and kidney function (HR 3.01; 95% CI 1.0-7.4; P = 0.043). In patients treated with ticagrelor, 35 MACCE were detected. There was no difference as compared to prasugrel-treated patients (24 events, HR 1.24, 95% CI 0.79-2.09; log-rank P value = 0.41). TIMI bleeding events were more frequent in ticagrelor-treated patients with STEMI during 12-month follow-up. There were no differences in MACCE between groups in this registry analysis.",

This trial explores whether intravenously administered iron isomaltoside 1000 (Monofer®) results in better clinical outcomes in patients undergoing complex heart valve surgery who are expected to receive transfusion.\nMETHODS\/DESIGN: In this prospective, single-center, double-blinded, randomized controlled trial, 214 patients undergoing reoperation or multiple valve surgery are randomly allocated to either the iron isomaltoside 1000 (IVFe) or the control group from August 2016 to August 2018. The IVFe group receives iron isomaltoside 1000 mg (maximum dose 20 mg\/kg) intravenously 3 days before and after the surgery. The control group receives an equivalent volume of normal saline. The primary endpoint is transfusion requirement (more than 1 unit of packed erythrocytes) for postoperative care until discharge and secondary endpoint are major complications, such as delayed ventilator therapy, acute kidney injury, and mortality. Reticulocyte count, plasma hepcidin, iron profiles (serum iron, serum ferritin, total iron-binding capacity, transferrin, transferrin saturation), coagulation profiles, urinary analysis, and chemical profiles are measured for three preoperative baseline-data days and just before surgery, except for hepcidin. After surgery, daily routine basic laboratory tests are measured just before discharge and reticulocyte count, iron profiles, and hepcidin are repeatedly checked for three postoperative days.\nDISCUSSIONS: From our study, we can clarify the following points: the first is the perioperative IVFe effect on the demand for transfusion, and clinical outcomes in reoperation or complex valve surgery and the second is the role of hepcidin in the effect of IVFe on the hemoglobin level increase.\nTRIAL REGISTRATION: ClinicalTrials.gov , Identifier: NCT02862665 .

        "Abstract":"BACKGROUND: Surgical endarterectomy with or without patch angioplasty has been considered the gold standard for treatment of symptomatic common femoral artery (CFA) disease. Surgical risks include wound infection, hematoma and lymph leak in approximately 17% of patients. Endovascular therapy has less procedure-related morbidity and mortality. Endovascular approaches achieve patency rates of 60% to 90% at 1 and 2 years utilizing atherectomy and balloon angioplasty. CFA stenting has been limited due to concerns of stent kinking, thrombosis and restenosis. Combined directional atherectomy with drug-coated balloon to treat CFA disease in patients with Rutherford II\/III patients has been studied recently. We sought to study the safety and outcomes of adjunct drug-coated balloon (DCB) therapy in symptomatic CFA disease patients, including critical limb ischemia (Rutherford IV), after achieving procedural success.\nOBJECTIVE: To evaluate the additive efficacy of drug coated balloon in treating CFA disease.\nMETHODS: Using retrospective single center data, we analyzed the outcomes of patients who underwent CFA interventions. In this non-randomized study, all patients from December 2010 to December 2014 with CFA disease underwent atherectomy (orbital, plaque excision or both) with adjunctive scoring balloon angioplasty (Ath\/PTA). After December 2014, patients treated with combination atherectomy and DCB, (Ath\/DCB), underwent final drug delivery to the vessel wall with drug-coated balloon. Distal embolic protection devices were used in the majority of patients. Primary efficacy endpoint was 1-year primary patency and freedom from clinically driven target lesion revascularization (CD-TLR). Patency of vessels was assessed at 12-month interval using duplex ultrasound.\nRESULTS: Seventy de novo common femoral artery stenotic lesions were treated in both groups. Mean age was 69 in (Ath\/PTA) group and 72 in Ath\/DCB group. Patients in each group had similar risk factor profiles including diabetes mellitus, hypertension, smoking, coronary artery disease, myocardial infarction, prior coronary revascularization, congestive heart failure, cerebrovascular accidents and chronic kidney disease. The Ath\/DCB group had more advanced disease presentation by Rutherford classification (intermittent claudication in 61% and critical limb ischemia in 39% versus intermittent claudication in 76% and chronic limb ischemia in 24%) when compared with the Ath\/PTA group. Primary efficacy endpoint was met in 85% and 94% (p = 0.26) in the Ath\/PTA and Ath\/DCB groups respectively. All patients had run-off angiography at the end of procedure to ensure patency.\nCONCLUSION: Adjunctive drug-coated balloon therapy does not increase the primary patency rate when compared with atherectomy and scoring balloon angioplasty alone at 1-year in common femoral artery disease treatment.",

        "Abstract":"BACKGROUND: Clinical trials have shown conflicting results regarding the use of volatile anaesthesia before or after an ischaemic insult in cardiac surgical patients and its effect on myocardial injury. This may be attributable to the failure of continuing volatile agents into the early postoperative period. We hypothesised that combined volatilebased anaesthesia and postoperative sedation would decrease the extent of myocardial injury after coronary artery bypass grafting (CABG) when compared with an intravenous, propofol-based approach. This study aimed to assess the feasibility of the perioperative protocol and investigate whether volatile anaesthesia provides cardioprotection in patients undergoing CABG.\nMETHODS: Randomized, controlled trial enrolling 157 patients with preserved left ventricular function scheduled for elective or urgent on-pump CABG. Patients received either volatile- or propofol-based anaesthesia and postoperative sedation. Volatile sedation in the ICU was provided with the use of the AnaConDa® device (Sedana Medical, Uppsala, Sweden). The primary outcome was myocardial injury measured by serial troponin measurement at the beginning of surgery, 2, 4 and 12-16 h after ICU admission. The secondary outcome was cardiac performance expressed as cardiac index (CI) and the need for inotropic and vasopressor drug support. The peak postoperative troponin level was defined as the highest level at any time in the first 16 h after surgery.\nRESULTS: 127 patients completed the study protocol, 60 patients in the volatile group and 67 patients in the propofol group. Troponin levels were similar between groups at all of the measured time points. There were no differences in cardiac index or vasoactive drug support except for the immediate post- cardiopulmonary bypass (CPB) period when patients in the volatile group had low systemic vascular resistance, high CI and required more vasopressors. There was no difference in postoperative kidney function, intensive care unit discharge or hospital discharge time.\nCONCLUSIONS: The use of volatile-based anaesthesia and postoperative sedation did not confer any cardioprotection compared with propofol-based anaesthesia and sedation in patients who had good left ventricular function and were undergoing CABG.",

        "Abstract":"Direct oral anticoagulants, which include the factor Xa inhibitor rivaroxaban, have some advantages over vitamin K antagonists in regard to stroke prevention in patients with atrial fibrillation. However, no antidotes to reverse the effect of oral anticoagulants are commercially available, which can complicate treating patients in whom reversal is urgent. We faced this challenge in a kidney transplant candidate, a 65-year-old man with end-stage renal disease who had been taking rivaroxaban for paroxysmal atrial fibrillation. When a deceased-donor kidney became available, we needed to rapidly reduce the patient's bleeding risk, while minimizing the cold ischemic time of the donor kidney. Therefore, we decided to take an experimental approach and perform therapeutic plasma exchange. The patient's plasma anti-factor Xa level decreased from 0.4 IU\/mL immediately before treatment to 0.21 IU\/mL afterward, indicating that rivaroxaban had been actively removed from circulation. Waste fluid showed significant anti-Xa activity, indicating that the risk of rebound anticoagulation had been mitigated. The patient subsequently underwent successful kidney transplantation. To our knowledge, this is the first report of therapeutic plasma exchange to reverse the effects of rivaroxaban in a patient undergoing urgent surgery. This treatment may also be suitable for patients who have life-threatening, large-volume bleeding, especially in the presence of substantial kidney or liver dysfunction.",

In particular, we demonstrated that incorporating the modified Mg(OH) nanoparticles within degradable coatings on drug-eluting arterial stents efficiently attenuates the inflammatory response and in-stent intimal thickening by more than 97 and 60%, respectively, in the porcine coronary artery, compared with that of drug-eluting stent control. We also observed that decreased inflammation allows better reconstruction of mouse renal glomeruli in a kidney tissue regeneration model.

        "Abstract":"OBJECTIVES: Acute renal failure is a common complication of major cardiovascular surgeries (One-third of patients). Adenosine release as a vascular vasodilator increases after cardiac surgery, which reduces renal and glomerular blood flow and subsequently causes kidney ischemic damage. The present study aimed at evaluating the impact of aminophylline as an adenosine receptor antagonist on renal function after cardiac surgery hoping to find an appropriate method to reduce acute kidney injury.\nMETHODS: The patients in the intervention group received 5 mg\/kg aminophylline bolus after induction of anesthesia; then, 0.25 mg\/kg\/hr of the drug was administered intraoperatively and up to 48 hours after surgery in the ICU cardiac surgery. Similar volume of normal saline was injected to the patients of the second group. Serum BUN, Cr, and GFR were measured pre- and postoperatively and 3 days postsurgery. Patients' 24- hour urine output and RIFLE were also calculated.\nRESULTS: Those patients who received medication were extubated earlier (P = 0.018) and received lower amount of inotropic drugs (P < 0001). According to the RIFLE criteria, most of the patients experienced no change or even improved GFR and Cr amounts compared to the control group (p < 0.05). GFR and Cr value of all the patients with Cleveland score, less and more than 6, showed a significant difference between the 2 groups (P = 0.001 and P = 0.01, respectively). According to the RIFLE criteria, most of the patients experienced no change or even improved GFR.\nCONCLUSIONS: Aminophylline in cardiac surgery can reduce the frequency of acute kidney injury according to RIFLE criteria and could be used in the prevention of AKI as a safe and efficient modality in high-risk patients. Also, the use of this drug may reduce the need for inotropic medication at the time of surgery, intensive care unit stay length, and extubation time.",

The maintenance dose of prasugrel 2.5 mg\/day was prescribed for patients with a low body weight (≤50 kg), elderly (≥75 years), or renal insufficiency (eGFR ≤30 mL\/min\/1.73 m). In-hospital events were assessed in 992 ACS patients treated with drug-eluting stents. Excluding 29 in-hospital deaths, out-of-hospital events were assessed in 963 ACS patients. The primary safety outcome measure was major bleeding (Bleeding Academic Research Consortium types 3 and 5). The incidence of in-hospital major bleeding was 3.4%. Multivariate analysis showed that being elderly, low body weight, renal insufficiency, stroke history, femoral approach, and mechanical support usage were independent predictors of in-hospital major bleeding.

Delayed graft function (DGF) remains the most frequent complication after this procedure, reaching more than 30%. Its prevention is essential as it impedes early- and long-term prognosis of transplantation. Numerous pharmacological interventions aiming to prevent ischemia-reperfusion injuries failed to reduce the rate of DGF. We hypothesize that cyclosporine as an early preconditioning procedure in donors would be associated with decreased DGF.\nMETHODS: The Cis-A-rein study is an investigator-initiated, prospective, multicenter, double-blind, randomized, controlled study performed to assess the effects of a donor preconditioning with cyclosporine A on kidney grafts function in transplanted patients. After randomization, a brain dead donor will receive 2.5 mg kg of cyclosporine A or the same volume of 5% glucose solution. The primary objective is to compare the rate of DGF, defined as the need for at least one dialysis session within the 7 days following transplantation, between both groups. The secondary objectives include rate of slow graft function, mild and severe DGF, urine output and serum creatinine during the first week after transplantation, rate of primary graft dysfunction, renal function and mortality at 1 year. The sample size (n = 648) was determined to obtain 80% power to detect a 10% difference for rate of DGF at day 7 between the two groups (30% of the patients in the placebo group and 20% of the patients in the intervention group).\nDISCUSSION: Delayed graft function is a major issue after renal transplantation, impeding long-term prognosis.

        "Abstract":"BACKGROUND: Off-pump coronary artery bypass surgery (OPCAB) is often complicated by hemodynamic instability, especially in patients with prior left ventricular (LV) dysfunction and appropriate choice of inotrope plays a vital role in perioperative management of these patients.\nAIM AND OBJECTIVE: To study hemodynamic effects and immediate outcome of prophylactic infusion of levosimendan in patients with the LV dysfunction undergoing OPCAB surgery and whether this strategy helps in successful conduct of OPCAB surgery.\nMATERIALS AND METHODS: After Institutional Ethics Committee approval, 60 patients posted for elective OPCAB surgery were randomly divided into two groups (n = 30 each). Patients with the LV ejection fraction <30% were included. Study group was started on injection levosimendan (@ 0.1 μg\/kg\/min) in the previous night before surgery and continued for 24 h including intraoperative period. Hemodynamic monitoring included heart rate, invasive blood pressure, cardiac index (CI), pulmonary capillary wedge pressure (PCWP), pulse oximetry, and arterial blood gases with serum lactates at as T0 (baseline), T1 (15 min after obtuse marginal and\/or PDA anastomoses), T2 (at end of surgery), T3 (6 h after surgery in Intensive Care Unit [ICU]), T4 (12 h after surgery), and T5 (24 h after surgery in ICU). Vasopressor was added to maintain mean arterial pressure >60 mmHg. Chi-square\/Fisher's exact\/Mid P exact test and Student's t-tests were applied for categorical and continuous data.\nRESULTS: CI was greater and PCWP reduced significantly in Group L during intraoperative and early postoperative period. Serum lactate concentration was lower in patients pretreated with levosimendan. Incidence of postoperative atrial fibrillation (POAF) (36.6 vs. 6.6%; P = 0.01), low cardiac output syndrome (LCOS) (30% vs. 6%; P = 0.02), and acute kidney injury (23.3% vs. 6.7%; P = 0.04) was less in Group L. Three patients (10%) in control group required conversion to cardiopulmonary bypass (CPB) as compared to none in the study group. There was no difference regarding ICU or hospital stay and mortality in both groups.\nCONCLUSION: Preoperative levosimendan helps in successful conduct of OPCAB and reduces the incidence of LCOS, POAF, conversion to CPB, and requirement of intra-aortic balloon pump.",

        "Abstract":"BACKGROUND: Chronic kidney disease (CKD) and inflammation play critical roles in atherosclerosis. There is limited evidence regarding the relationship between CKD and patients receiving second-generation drug-eluting stents for coronary artery disease.\nOBJECTIVE: This study aimed to investigate the effect of CKD on cardiovascular and renal events in patients undergoing percutaneous coronary intervention (PCI) with everolimus-eluting stents (EES).\nMETHODS: We analyzed 504 consecutive patients with stable angina pectoris and significant coronary artery stenosis treated with EES. CKD was defined as an estimated glomerular filtration rate < 60 mL\/min\/1.73 m2 before coronary angiography. The primary outcome was the occurrence of major adverse renal and cardiovascular events (MARCE) including cardiac death, revascularization, heart failure, cerebral infarction, worsening renal function > 25% from baseline, and renal replacement therapy at 1 year.\nRESULTS: Patients were divided into the a MARCE (n = 126) and a non-MARCE (n = 378) group. The incidence of CKD was 51% in all subjects (including those on hemodialysis) and was significantly higher in the MARCE group than in the non-MARCE group (p = 0.00001). Multivariate logistic regression analysis identified that CKD was independently associated with MARCE (adjusted odds ratio 2.03, 95% confidence interval 1.21-3.39, p = 0.007). Patients were divided into four groups based on CKD and C-reactive protein (CRP) level prior to initial coronary angiography. Cox proportional hazards analysis revealed that patients with CKD and high CRP (≥0.3 mg\/dL) had the worst prognosis (hazard ratio 4.371, 95% confidence interval 2.634-7.252, p = 0.00001) compared to patients without CKD and with low CRP.\nCONCLUSION: CKD combined with CRP predicted more clinical events in patients undergoing PCI with EES.",

We examined the hazard of significant kidney events, cardiovascular events, and death using Cox proportional hazard models with propensity score weighting. The composite significant kidney event end point was defined as the first occurrence of a ≥30% decline in eGFR to an eGFR<60 ml\/min per 1.73 m, initiation of dialysis, or kidney transplant. The composite cardiovascular event end point was defined as the first occurrence of hospitalization for acute myocardial infarction, acute coronary syndrome, stroke, or congestive heart failure; coronary artery bypass grafting; or percutaneous coronary intervention, and it was only examined in those free of cardiovascular disease at baseline.\nRESULTS: Over a maximum of 5 years, there were 4707 significant kidney events, 1498 deaths, and 818 cardiovascular events. Compared with thiazide diuretics, hazard ratios for significant kidney events for -blockers, calcium channel blockers, and loop diuretics were 0.81 (95% confidence interval, 0.74 to 0.89), 0.67 (95% confidence interval, 0.58 to 0.78), and 1.19 (95% confidence interval, 1.00 to 1.41), respectively. Compared with thiazide diuretics, hazard ratios of mortality for -blockers, calcium channel blockers, and loop diuretics were 1.19 (95% confidence interval, 0.97 to 1.44), 0.73 (95% confidence interval, 0.52 to 1.03), and 1.67 (95% confidence interval, 1.31 to 2.13), respectively.

European Heart Rhythm Association Practical Guide on the use of new oral anticoagulants in patients with non-valvular atrial fibrillation. Europace 2013;15:625-651; Heidbuchel et al. Updated European Heart Rhythm Association Practical Guide on the use of non-vitamin K antagonist anticoagulants in patients with non-valvular atrial fibrillation. Europace 2015;17:1467-1507]. Non-vitamin K antagonist oral anticoagulants (NOACs) are an alternative for vitamin K antagonists (VKAs) to prevent stroke in patients with atrial fibrillation (AF) and have emerged as the preferred choice, particularly in patients newly started on anticoagulation. Both physicians and patients are becoming more accustomed to the use of these drugs in clinical practice. However, many unresolved questions on how to optimally use these agents in specific clinical situations remain. The European Heart Rhythm Association (EHRA) set out to coordinate a unified way of informing physicians on the use of the different NOACs. A writing group identified 20 topics of concrete clinical scenarios for which practical answers were formulated, based on available evidence. The 20 topics are as follows i.e., (1) Eligibility for NOACs; (2) Practical start-up and follow-up scheme for patients on NOACs; (3) Ensuring adherence to prescribed oral anticoagulant intake; (4) Switching between anticoagulant regimens; (5) Pharmacokinetics and drug-drug interactions of NOACs; (6) NOACs in patients with chronic kidney or advanced liver disease; (7) How to measure the anticoagulant effect of NOACs; (8) NOAC plasma level measurement: rare indications, precautions, and potential pitfalls; (9) How to deal with dosing errors; (10) What to do if there is a (suspected) overdose without bleeding, or a clotting test is indicating a potential risk of bleeding; (11) Management of bleeding under NOAC therapy; (12) Patients undergoing a planned invasive procedure, surgery or ablation; (13) Patients requiring an urgent surgical intervention; (14) Patients with AF and coronary artery disease; (15) Avoiding confusion with NOAC dosing across indications; (16) Cardioversion in a NOAC-treated patient; (17) AF patients presenting with acute stroke while on NOACs; (18) NOACs in special situations; (19) Anticoagulation in AF patients with a malignancy; and (20) Optimizing dose adjustments of VKA.

        "Abstract":"BACKGROUND: Chronic kidney disease (CKD) remains an independent predictor of cardiovascular morbidity and mortality. CKD complicates referral for percutaneous coronary intervention (PCI) in non-ST-segment-elevation myocardial infarction (NSTEMI) patients because of the risk for acute kidney injury and the need for dialysis, with American College of Cardiology\/American Heart Association guidelines underscoring the limited data on these patients.\nMETHODS AND RESULTS: Using the National Inpatient Sample to analyze hospitalizations in the United States from 2004 to 2014, we sought to assess PCI utilization and in-hospital outcomes in NSTEMI admissions with CKD. NSTEMI admissions were identified by  code 410.7. CKD admissions were identified by  code 585. Propensity score-matched cohorts of patients with NSTEMI were matched for age, sex, comorbidities, race, median household income, primary payer status, and hospital characteristics. Of 4 488 795 hospitalizations for NSTEMI, 31% underwent PCI. Overall, 89% of admissions had no CKD. In addition, 32% of NSTEMI admissions with no CKD and 23%, 14%, and 22% with CKD stages 3, 4, and 5 underwent PCI, respectively. Hospitalized NSTEMI patients with CKD stages 4 and 5 had 41% and 20% less likelihood, respectively, of undergoing PCI compared with those with no CKD. Among hospitalized NSTEMI patients with no CKD or CKD stage 3, 4, or 5, PCI-treated groups had 63%, 57%, 39%, and 59% lower likelihood, respectively, of all-cause, in-hospital mortality compared with propensity score-matched medically managed groups.\nCONCLUSIONS: PCI use decreased among hospitalized NSTEMI patients as CKD severity increased, and all-cause, in-hospital mortality was greater for NSTEMI patients admitted with more severe CKD regardless of treatment strategy.",

The ART (Arterial Revascularization Trial) was designed to compare survival after bilateral versus single internal thoracic artery grafting. Many of the ART patients (≈30%) received perioperative aprotinin. We investigated the association between perioperative aprotinin administration and short-term (in-hospital) and long-term outcomes by performing a post hoc analysis of the ART.\nMETHODS AND RESULTS: Among patients enrolled in the ART (n=3102) from 2004 to 2007, we excluded those who did not undergo surgery (n=18) and those with no information about use of perioperative aprotinin (n=9). Finally, 836 of 3076 patients (27%) received aprotinin. Propensity matching was used to select 536 pairs for final comparison. Aprotinin was also associated with an increased risk of hospital mortality (9 [1.7%] versus 1 [0.2%]; odds ratio, 9.12; 95% confidence interval [CI], 1.15-72.2; =0.03), intra-aortic balloon pump insertion (37 [6.9%] versus 17 [3.2%]; odds ratio, 2.26; 95% CI, 1.26-4.07; =0.006), and acute kidney injury (102 [19.0%] versus 76 [14.2%]; odds ratio, 1.42; 95% CI, 1.03-1.97; =0.03). Aprotinin was not associated with a lower incidence of transfusion (37 [6.9%] versus 28 [5.2%]; odds ratio, 1.34; 95% CI, 0.81-2.23; =0.25) and reexploration (26 [4.9%] versus 19 [3.5%]; hazard ratio, 1.39; 95% CI, 0.76-2.53; =0.28).

        "Abstract":"Inflammation is a major contributor to the pathogenesis of ischemic acute kidney injury (AKI), which complicates the post-operative outcomes of large numbers of hospitalized surgical patients. Hydroxychloroquine (HCQ), a well-known anti-malarial drug, is commonly used in clinical practice for its anti-inflammatory actions. However, little is known about its role in renal ischemia\/reperfusion (I\/R) injury. In the current study, mice were subjected to I\/R injury and HCQ was administered for seven days by gavage prior to surgery. In parallel, HK-2 human renal proximal tubule cells were prophylactically treated with HCQ and then were exposed to hypoxia\/reoxygenation (H\/R). The results showed that HCQ significantly attenuated renal dysfunction evidenced by blunted decreases in serum creatinine and kidney injury molecular-1 expression and the improvement of HK-2 cell viability. Additionally, HCQ markedly reduced macrophage and neutrophil infiltration, pro-inflammatory cytokine production, and NLRP3 inflammasome activation. Mechanistic studies showed that HCQ could inhibit the priming of the NLRP3 inflammasome by down-regulating I\/R or H\/R-induced NF-κB signaling. Moreover, HCQ reduced cathepsin (CTS) B, CTSD and CTSL activity, and their redistribution from lysosomes to cytoplasm. CTSB and CTSL (not CTSD) were implicated in I\/R triggered NLRP3 inflammasome activation. Notably, we found that HCQ attenuated renal injury through downregulation of CTSB and CTSL-mediated NLRP3 inflammasome activation. This study provides new insights into the anti-inflammatory effect of HCQ in the treatment of AKI.",

The similar trend was observed with long-term DAPT in CKD population. But it did not reach statistical significance (HR 3.15, 95% CI 0.64-15.63, P=.160).\nCONCLUSIONS: The rates of POCO and coronary thrombotic events were significantly higher in patients with CKD compared with those without CKD, which were not affected by short- or long-term DAPT.

Previously, small studies have reported an association between AF and poorer outcomes among patients with STEMI. We performed this study to investigate the impact of AF on in-hospital outcomes in patients with STEMI treated with primary percutaneous coronary intervention (PPCI) using a large national database. The study population constituted of patients 18 years and older with a primary discharge diagnosis of STEMI and who underwent PPCI. Using a 2:1 matching protocol, matched groups of patients with AF (N = 24,680) and without (N = 49,198) were developed. Among 1,493,859 patients with STEMI who underwent PPCI, 129,354 patients (8.7%) had AF. In the propensity-matched cohort, adjusted in-hospital mortality was significantly higher for patients with AF compared with patients with no AF (10.3% vs 9.4%) (adjusted odds ratio [OR] 1.10; confidence interval [CI] 1.06 to 1.16; p <0.0001). Patients with AF were also at higher risk of heart failure, cardiogenic shock, acute stroke, acute kidney injury, vascular complications, need for blood transfusion, and a composite outcome of gastrointestinal and retroperitoneal bleeding. Patients with AF were less likely to be treated with drug-eluting stent compared with patients without AF (51.4% vs 56.6%) (adjusted OR 0.81; CI 0.79 to 0.84; p <0.001). Among patients presenting with STEMI and who underwent PPCI, AF is present in about 8% of patients.

        "Abstract":"Ischemia-reperfusion injury has multiple effects on a transplanted allograft, including delayed or impaired graft function, compromised long-term survival, and an association with an increased incidence of rejection. Eculizumab, a monoclonal antibody blocking terminal complement activation, has been postulated to be an effective agent in the prevention or amelioration of IRI. We performed a single-center prospective, randomized controlled trial involving 57 pediatric kidney transplant recipients between 2012 and 2016. The immunosuppressive protocol included two doses of alemtuzumab; half of the patients were randomized to receive a single dose of eculizumab prior to transplantation. Maintenance immunosuppression was based on a combination of low-dose tacrolimus and mycophenolate, without steroids. Eculizumab-treated patients had a significantly better early graft function, less arteriolar hyalinosis and chronic glomerulopathy on a protocol biopsies taken on day 30, 1 year, and 3 years after transplantation. In the eculizumab group, four non-vaccinated children lost their grafts during the course of a flu-like infection. Eculizumab is associated with better early graft function and improved graft morphology; however, there was an unacceptably high number of early graft losses among the eculizumab-treated children. While a promising strategy, the best approach to complement inhibition remains to be established.",

A total of 25 cases of coronary heart disease patients(DES placement time ≥8 months) with coronary artery angiography showing DES in-stent restenosis (ISR) in Zunyi medical college affiliated hospital from July 2013 to December 2015 were included in this study and patient's data were retrospectively analyzed.In these patients with ISR, OCT images were acquired before percutaneous coronary intervention. Patients were divided into the ISNA group (12 patients and 12 lesions) and non-ISNA group(13 patients and 13 lesions) according to the result of OCT. ISNA on OCT was defined as neointima formation with the presence of lipids or calcification.  (1) The incidence of chronic kidney disease and increased low-density lipoprotein cholesterol level in ISNA group were significant higher than that in non-ISNA group(all 0.05). The stent implantation time in ISNA group was longer than that in the non-ISNA group(53.0(14.0, 81.0) months vs. 15.0(8.5, 32.5) months, 0.01). In addition, clinical manifestation of acute coronary syndrome was present in 8 out of 12 patientsin ISNA group, and stable angina pectoris was found in 10 out of 13 casesin non-ISNA group(0.01). (2) Quantitative analysis of OCT showed that the lumen area was less in ISNA group than in non-ISNA group((3.45±1.82)mm(2) vs. (4.17±1.68)mm(2), 0.01), and neointimal area(3.89(2.26, 5.52)mm(2) vs. 2.96(1.99, 4.22)mm(2), 0.01), neointimal load (53.15(40.18, 67.30)% vs. 41.54(32.08, 56.91)%, 0.01), neointimal thickness(0.98(0.63, 1.36)μm vs. 0.72(0.51, 1.03)μm, 0.01) were higher in ISNA group than in non-ISNA group.(3)Qualitative analysis of OCT showed that the prevalence of homogeneous intima was less in the ISNA group than in the non-ISNA group ((41.42±22.56)% vs.(72.06±18.68)%, 0.05), on the contrary, the heterogeneous intima was more common in the ISNA group ((58.57±22.56)% vs. (27.94±18.68)%, 0.05). There was no significant difference between two groups in the peri-stentmicrovessels (9\/12 vs. 5\/13,0.05), and prevalence of intraintimalmicrovessels was higher in the ISNA group than in non-ISNA group (7\/12 vs. 2\/13, 0.05). In addition, thin cap fibrous plaque(7\/12 vs. 0, 0.01), disrupted intima with visible cavity (7\/12 vs. 1\/13, 0.05),andintraluminal red thrombus(7\/12 vs. 1\/13, 0.05) were significantly higher in ISNA group than in non-ISNA group.  Results of OCT show that ISNA occurs frequently in patients with ISR after DES implantation. The stent implantation time, incidence of chronic kidney disease and higher low-density lipoprotein cholesterol level are associated with the formation of ISNA in these patients.",

        "Abstract":"PURPOSE: A case report describing use of idarucizumab for dabigatran reversal without the use of hemostatic agents in a patient who developed acute upper gastrointestinal (GI) bleeding while receiving triple antithrombotic therapy is presented.\nSUMMARY: A 77-year-old man with a complex cardiac history presented to the emergency room with chief complaints of black tarry stools and low blood pressures for 4 days. His past medical history included recent percutaneous coronary intervention (PCI) and drug-eluting stent (DES) placement, atrial fibrillation, hypertension, hyperlipidemia, coronary artery disease, coronary artery bypass graft surgery, stage 3 chronic kidney disease, and cholecystectomy. His triple antithrombotic therapy consisted of aspirin, clopidogrel, and dabigatran. The patient stated that his last dose of dabigatran was taken the night before. Serum dabigatran levels were not measured. Due to suspicion of acute upper GI bleeding, all antithrombotic agents were withheld. Treatment with idarucizumab, i.v. pantoprazole, and blood transfusion was ordered. An upper endoscopy was safely performed 24 hours later and revealed a minor Mallory-Weiss tear. The patient was discharged 48 hours later with prescriptions for acid suppressant and triple antithrombotic therapy; his melena had resolved before discharge. At 14-week follow-up, the patient reported that his cardiologist had deleted aspirin from his antithrombotic regimen.\nCONCLUSION: A patient who had recently undergone PCI and DES placement and was receiving aspirin, clopidogrel, and dabigatran for atrial fibrillation was successfully treated for acute GI bleeding with idarucizumab without the use of a hemostatic agent.",

        "Abstract":"BACKGROUND: Available technologies could avoid global ischemia for the removal of a renal tumor.\nOBJECTIVE: To present hyperaccuracy three-dimensional (HA3D) reconstruction during robot-assisted partial nephrectomy (RAPN) and compare its efficacy in sponsoring successful selective clamping of renal arterial branches during RAPN.\nDESIGN, SETTING, AND PARTICIPANTS: Patients undergoing RAPN (January 2016-July 2017) for renal mass PADUA score ≥10 who underwent abdominal computed tomography scan with angiography. Since February 2017 HA3D reconstruction was performed.\nSURGICAL PROCEDURE: HA3D reconstruction-aided RAPN and standard RAPN with selective clamping.\nMEASUREMENTS: Intraoperative variables focusing on the renal arterial pedicle management and success rate of its planned management.\nRESULTS AND LIMITATIONS: Thirty-one patients in group no HA3D and 21 in group HA3D. The median (standard deviation) tumor size was 50.9 and 50.8mm (p=0.97), and median PADUA scores 10.5 and 11 (p=0.85) for groups no HA3D and HA3D, respectively. In group no HA3D, a significantly higher number of patients underwent global ischemia (80% vs 24%, p<0.01). Of note, in 90% of the group HA3D cases, intraoperative management of the renal pedicle was performed as preoperatively planned; in 39% of the group no HA3D cases, management of the renal arterial pedicle was varied intraoperatively (p=0.04). We disclose the limited sample size and the experimental technique.\nCONCLUSIONS: Preoperative simulation of selective ischemia was feasible and effective with HA3D reconstruction. In all the RAPN cases performed, selective clamping was successful, avoiding ischemia of the healthy renal remnant. A strict collaboration between urologists and bioengineers is mandatory to improve the technology.\nPATIENT SUMMARY: In this report, we found that an accurate three-dimensional reconstruction of the kidney before conservative surgery for renal cancer seems to help in avoiding the global ischemia of the kidney. Further studies are needed to conclude if avoiding a percentage of ischemia to the kidney is clinically relevant.",

        "Published":null,
        "Abstract":"BACKGROUND: Tranexamic acid (TXA) is a common antifibrinolytic agent used to minimize bleeding in cardiac surgery. Up to 50% cardiac surgical patients have chronic renal dysfunction (CRD). Optimal dosing of TXA in CRD remains poorly investigated. This is important as TXA is renally eliminated with accumulation in CRD. High TXA doses are associated with postoperative seizures. This study measures plasma TXA concentrations in CRD cardiac surgical patients for pharmacokinetic modeling and dose adjustment recommendations.\nMETHODS: This prospective cohort study enrolled 48 patients with stages 1-5 CRD, classified by Kidney Disease Outcome Quality Initiative. Patients were separated into 2 treatment groups. A \"low-risk\" group underwent simple aortocoronary bypass or single-valve repair\/replacement and received a 50 mg\/kg TXA bolus. A \"high-risk\" group underwent redo, aortic, multiple valve or combination surgery and received the Blood Conservation Using Anti-fibrinolytics Trial dosing regimen (loading dose 30 mg\/kg, infusion 16 mg\/kg\/h with 2 mg\/kg in pump prime). Primary outcome identified changes in TXA clearance and distribution volume, which provided the rationale for dose adjustment. Descriptive clinical outcomes assessed postoperative seizures, blood loss, ischemic-thrombotic complications, in-hospital mortality, and length of hospital stay.\nRESULTS: TXA concentrations were elevated and sustained above the therapeutic threshold for approximately 12 hours in high-risk stages 3-5 groups, in accordance to CRD severity.\nCONCLUSIONS: Using a pharmacokinetic model, we propose a simple new TXA dosing regimen that optimizes maximal antifibrinolysis and avoids excessive drug dosing.",

This is a prospective, multicentre, European, all-comers registry with a 1000 patients treated with COMBO stent. Target lesion failure (TLF), a composite of target vessel-myocardial infarction (tv-MI), cardiac death and target lesion revascularization, and the occurrence of stent thrombosis (ST) in relation with DAPT cessation before 30 and 180days of follow-up is evaluated. At 30days follow-up 48 patients were not on DAPT, at 180days follow-up of 78 patients had no DAPT. Patients with DAPT discontinuation were older, had overall lower left ventricle ejection fraction and more frequent chronic renal failure. No TLF and especially no stent thrombosis were observed in these patients.\nCONCLUSIONS: Discontinuation of DAPT within 6months after COMBO stent placement did not influence the rate of TLF up to 1-year follow-up.

        "Abstract":"INTRODUCTION: Type 2 diabetes mellitus is a common disease, affecting up to 13.1% of the Portuguese population. In addition to the known micro and macrovascular complications, drug side effects constitute a major concern, leading to changes in the treatment guidelines, which favor safety over efficacy. Metformin is the first-line pharmacological treatment for most patients with type 2 diabetes mellitus; however, it has been associated with vitamin B12 deficiency in up to 30% of treated patients. The authors describe the prevalence of vitamin B12 deficiency in a diabetic population and explore the possible underlying factors.\nMATERIAL AND METHODS: Retrospective, observational study. Clinical and laboratory data of type 2 diabetes mellitus patients whose vitamin B12 status was evaluated in the last decade (2005 - 2016) were analyzed. Patients with known malabsorptive syndromes or having undergone bariatric surgery were excluded from the study. Statistical analysis of the data was done and the results were considered statistically significant at p values < 0.05.\nRESULTS: The study included a total of 1007 patients (58% women) with a mean age of 66.4 ± 12.2 years and 11 ± 10.4 years of type 2 diabetes mellitus duration. These patients had a high prevalence of complications: diabetic renal disease 47.7%, neuropathy 9.2%, retinopathy 14.9%, coronary artery disease 8.4%, cerebrovascular disease 10.9%, and peripheral arterial disease 5.5%. Vitamin B12 deficiency (< 174 ng \/ dL) was present in 21.4% of the population and this subgroup was older (68.4 vs 65.8 years, p = 0.006), had a longer type 2 diabetes mellitus duration (13.35 vs 10.36 years; p = 0.001), higher prevalence of retinopathy (20.9% vs 13.3%; p = 0.005) and thyroid dysfunction (34% vs 23.7%; p = 0.002). Vitamin B12 deficiency was also more frequent in patients treated with metformin (24.7% vs 15.8%; p = 0.017), antiplatelet agents (25.4% vs 16.2%, p < 0.001), and calcium channel blockers (26.8% vs 18.2%; p = 0.001). After adjustment for possible confounders, the variables associated with B12 deficiency were: metformin, hypothyroidism, age and type 2 diabetes mellitus duration.\nDISCUSSION: Despite the retrospective design, the results report a high prevalence of vitamin B12 deficiency in the type 2 diabetic population. This study also demonstrates that the B12 deficiency risk is higher in older people, with longer diabetes mellitus duration, hypothyroidism and treated with metformin.\nCONCLUSION: Further studies are needed to identify the risk factors for the B12 deficit. The recognition of these variables will contribute to optimize the screening and prevention of the B12 deficiency in type 2 diabetes mellitus.",

        "Abstract":"OBJECTIVE: Early cessation of dual antiplatelet therapy (DAPT) is related to stent thrombosis (ST). The use of second-generation everolimus- and zotarolimus-eluting stents is associated with low restenosis rates and short duration of clopidogrel usage. Non-cardiac surgery in recently stent-implanted patients is associated with major adverse cardiac events (MACEs). Chronic renal failure patients awaiting renal transplantation may also undergo coronary stent implantation prior to surgery. Here we aimed to investigate the safety of early (3 months) DAPT interruption in second-generation drug-eluting stent (DES)-implanted renal transplant recipients.\nMETHODS: In total, 106 previously stent-implanted chronic renal failure patients who underwent renal transplantation were retrospectively enrolled. Three groups were formed according to stent type and the duration of DAPT: early-interruption (3 months from DES implantation), lateinterruption (3-12 months from DES implantation), and bare-metal stent (BMS; at least 1 month from BMS implantation) groups.\nRESULTS: Comparison among BMS, DES-early and DES-late groups indicated no difference in ST, myocardial infarction, death, and MACEs. In addition, no difference was observed in ST (p=0.998), myocardial infarction (p=0.998), death (p=0.999), and MACEs (p=0.998) between DES-early and DES-late groups.\nCONCLUSION: Early (3 months) interruption of antiplatelet treatment with second-generation stents before renal transplantation seems to be safe and does not lead to increase in the occurrence of ST and MACEs.",

        "Abstract":"BACKGROUND: Recent randomized evidence has demonstrated benefit with complete revascularization during the index hospitalization for multivessel coronary artery disease ST-segment elevation myocardial infarction (STEMI) patients; however, this benefit likely depends on the risk of future major adverse cardiovascular events (MACE).\nMETHODS: Using data from Duke University Medical Center (2003-2012), we identified those at high risk for 1-year MACE among 664 STEMI patients with conservatively managed non-infarct-related artery (non-IRA) lesions. Using multivariable logistic regression, we identified clinical and angiographic characteristics associated with MACE (death, myocardial infarction, urgent revascularization) to 1 year and developed an integer-based risk prediction model for clinical use.\nRESULTS: In this cohort (median age 60 years, 30% female), the unadjusted Kaplan-Meier rates for MACE at 30 days and 1 year were 10% and 28%, respectively. Characteristics associated with MACE at 1 year included reduced left ventricular ejection fraction, hypertension, heart failure, higher-risk non-IRA vessels (left main), renal insufficiency, and greater % stenosis of non-IRA lesions. A 15-point risk score including these variables had modest discrimination (C-index 0.67) across a spectrum of subsequent risk (4%-88%) for 1-year MACE.\nCONCLUSIONS: There is a wide spectrum of risk following primary percutaneous coronary intervention for STEMI patients with multivessel disease. Using readily available clinical characteristics, the expected incidence of MACE by 1 year can be calculated with a simplified risk score, facilitating a tailored approach to clinical care.",

        "Published":null,
        "Abstract":"INTRODUCTION: Advances in modern medicine have led to people living longer and healthier lives. Frailty is an emerging concept in medicine yet to be explored as a risk factor in cardiac surgery. When it comes to CABG surgery, randomized controlled clinical trials have primarily focused on low-risk (ROOBY, CORONARY), elevated-risk (GOPCABE) or high-risk patients (BBS), but not on frail patients. Therefore, we believe that off-pump CABG could be an important technique in patients with limited functional capacity to respond to surgical stress. In this study, the authors introduce the new national, multicenter, randomized, controlled trial \"FRAGILE\", to be developed in the main cardiac surgery centers of Brazil, to clarify the potential benefit of off-pump CABG in frail patients.\nMETHODS: FRAGILE is a two-arm, parallel-group, multicentre, individually randomized (1:1) controlled trial which will enroll 630 patients with blinded outcome assessment (at 30 days, 6 months, 1 year, 2 years and 3 years), which aims to compare adverse cardiac and cerebrovascular events after off-pump versus on-pump CABG in pre-frail and frail patients. Primary outcomes will be all-cause mortality, acute myocardial infarction, cardiac arrest with successful resuscitation, low cardiac output syndrome\/cardiogenic shock, stroke, and coronary reintervention. Secondary outcomes will be major adverse cardiac and cerebrovascular events, operative time, mechanical ventilation time, hyperdynamic shock, new onset of atrial fibrillation, renal replacement therapy, reoperation for bleeding, pneumonia, length of stay in intensive care unit, length of stay in hospital, number of units of blood transfused, graft patency, rate of complete revascularization, neurobehavioral outcomes after cardiac surgery, quality of life after cardiac surgery and costs.\nDISCUSSION: FRAGILE trial will determine whether off-pump CABG is superior to conventional on-pump CABG in the surgical treatment of pre-frail and frail patients.\nTRIAL REGISTRATION: ClinicalTrials.gov, ID: NCT02338947.

        "Published":"2017-11-24",
        "Abstract":"BACKGROUND: The topic of aspirin (acetylsalicylic acid, ASA) use in coronary artery disease patients planned for coronary artery bypass grafting during perioperative period is among the most disputed issues in cardiac surgery. We designed a study to weigh the risks and benefits of continued ASA ingestion until the time of surgery.\nMETHODS: In this randomized double-blind clinical trial, 206 consecutive patients scheduled for isolated coronary artery bypass surgery (CABG) were randomly stratified into two groups. In group 1 (104 cases), patients were given 80 mg ASA per day until the day of surgery. In group 2 (102 patients), ASA (80 mg per day) was stopped 4 days before the operation. Patients in these two groups were similar in terms of preoperative patient and procedural characteristics. ASA was resumed 24 hours after the surgery in all patients.\nRESULTS: The rates of bleeding and reexploration within 24 hours of surgery were significantly higher in group 1 (824.3 vs. 492.1 mL,  < 0.001 and 5.7% vs. 0,  = 0.0138, respectively). The amount of intra- and postoperative packed red blood cell (PRBC) transfusion was considerably greater in group 1 (mean: 1.83 vs. 0.71 units,  < 0.001). The rate of hospital mortality was similar (1.9% in both the groups,  = 0.98). Patients in group 1 had significantly longer mean hospital stay than patients in group 2 (8 vs. 5.1 days,  < 0.001). Again the time interval between weaning from heart-lung machine and closing the sternum was strikingly longer in group 1 (mean: 32.1 vs. 14.5 minutes,  < 0.001). The incidence of adverse postoperative outcomes such as myocardial infarction, stroke, and renal failure was not statistically different between the two groups.\nCONCLUSION: Sustained ASA use until the day of surgery in patients planned for elective isolated CABG can result in excessive bleeding, increased rate of reexploration, and need for more PRBC transfusion without any proven beneficial effect on reducing unfavorable postoperative outcomes. Hence, we recommend discontinuing ASA between 3 and 5 days before non-urgent CABG while keeping it on in nonelective circumstances.",

The relative treatment effect of one strategy over another was assessed by propensity-score matching method. The primary outcome was a composite of death, myocardial infarction, or stroke.\nRESULTS: Median follow-up duration was 4.7 years. In the matched cohort, both groups demonstrated a similar risk for the primary outcome (adjusted hazard ratio [HR]: 0.94; 95% CI: 0.77-1.15; P=.54). Compared with CABG, PCI exhibited higher risks of myocardial infarction (HR: 2.11; 95% CI: 1.16-3.83; P=.01) and repeated revascularization (HR: 5.95; 95% CI: 3.94-8.98; P<.001). In the overall population, age, presence of chronic kidney disease, and low ejection fraction (<40%) were key clinical predictors of primary outcome regardless of the treatment strategy. However, factors deemed to be associated with perioperative morbidity were determinants of primary outcome in the CABG group, whereas those generally associated with the severity of atherosclerotic coronary artery disease were strong predictors in the PCI group.\nCONCLUSIONS: Among patients with significant LMCAD, the long-term risk of the composite outcome of death, myocardial infarction, or stroke was similar between CABG and PCI. Clinical variables that differentially predict adverse outcomes might be useful in triaging appropriate revascularization strategy.",

        "Published":"2017-10-23",
        "Abstract":"OBJECTIVE: Acute kidney injury (AKI) is an important risk factor for a number of adverse outcomes including end-stage renal disease and cardiovascular morbidity and mortality. Whilst many clinical situations that can induce AKI are known-e.g. drug toxicity, contrast agent exposure or ischemia during surgery-targeted preventive or therapeutic measures are still lacking. As to renoprotective strategies, remote ischemic preconditioning (RIPC) is one of the most promising novel approaches and has been examined by a number of clinical trials. The aim of this study was to use blood oxygenation level-dependent (BOLD) MRI as a surrogate parameter to assess the effect of RIPC in healthy volunteers.\nMATERIALS AND METHODS: In this IRB-approved, prospective study, 40 healthy volunteers were stratified with 20 undergoing an RIPC procedure (i.e. RIPC group) with a transient ischemia of the right arm, and 20 undergoing a sham procedure. Before and after the procedure, both kidneys of all participants were scanned using a 12-echo mGRE sequence for functional BOLD imaging at 3T. For each volunteer, 180 ROIs were placed in the cortex and the medulla of the kidneys. Ultimately, R2* values, which have an inverse correlation with the oxygenation level of tissue, were averaged for the RIPC and control groups.\nRESULTS: Following intervention, mean R2* values significantly decreased in the RIPC group in both the cortex (18.6 ± 2.3 vs. 17.5 ± 1.7 Hz; p = 0.0047) and medulla (34 ± 5.2 vs. 32.2 ± 4.2 Hz; p = 0.0001). However, no significant differences were observed in the control group.\nCONCLUSION: RIPC can be non-invasively assessed in healthy volunteers using BOLD MRI at 3T, demonstrating a higher oxygen content in kidney tissue. This study presents a first-in-man trial establishing a quantifiable readout of RIPC and its effects on kidney physiology. BOLD measurements may advance clinical trials in further evaluating RIPC for future clinical care.",

        "Abstract":"There are limited real-world data on prevalence and predictors of dual antiplatelet therapy (DAPT) prolongation beyond one year after acute coronary syndrome (ACS). We have explored such issue in the START ANTIPLATELET Registry, which is a prospective, observational, multicenter, Italian registry performed in seven Italian cardiology institutions including patients admitted for ACS and followed up to one year. Out of a total population of 840 ACS patients, 596 patients had completed 12-month follow-up being on DAPT. Decision to prolong DAPT beyond one year was taken in 79 patients (13%), whereas in 517 patients DAPT was stopped. The strongest predictors of DAPT continuation were a new cardiovascular events after the index admission event (OR 3.3, 95% CI 1.4-7.7), no bleeding complications (OR 3.2, 95% CI 1.2-8.3) and no anemia during one-year follow-up (OR 2.6, 95% CI 1.1-5.9); other independent predictors were renal failure (OR 2.5, 95% CI 1.3-5.0) and peripheral artery disease (OR 1.8, 95% CI 1.1-3.0). The choice of DAPT prolongation was not correlated with younger ager, presence of diabetes mellitus, coronary angioplasty as initial treatment strategy or type of implanted stent (drug-eluting vs bare metal). In conclusion, this study provides a real-world snapshot on the factors influencing the option to continue DAPT beyond one year after ACS; a low bleeding risk seems to influence the choice to prolong DAPT more than a high ischemic risk.",

        "Abstract":"Atrial fibrillation (AF) is one of the most common complications in patients who undergo coronary artery bypass graft surgery (CABG). The aim of this study was to evaluate the effect of L-carnitine administration on postoperative AF and the levels of C-reactive protein (CRP) following CABG. The effects of L-carnitine on the incidence of acute kidney injury after CABG were also assessed. One hundred thirty-four patients undergoing elective CABG, without a history of AF or previous L-carnitine treatment, were randomly assigned to an L-carnitine group (3000 mg\/d L-carnitine) or a control group. CRP levels, as a biomarker of inflammation, were assessed in all the patients before surgery as baseline levels and 48 hours postoperatively. Neutrophil gelatinase-associated lipocalin, as a kidney biomarker, was also measured in the patients before surgery and 2 hours thereafter. The incidence of AF was 13.4% in our population. The incidence of AF was decreased in the L-carnitine group (7.5% in the L-carnitine group vs 19.4% in the control group; P = 0.043) and the postoperative CRP level (8.79 ± 6.9 in the L-carnitine group, and 10.83 ± 5.7 in the control group; P = 0.021). The postoperative neutrophil gelatinase-associated lipocalin concentration demonstrated no significant rise after surgery compared with the preoperative concentration (72.54 ± 20.30 in the L-carnitine group vs 67.68 ± 22.71 in the placebo group; P = 0.19). Our study showed that L-carnitine administration before CABG might inhibit and reduce the incidence of AF after CABG. It seems that a rise in the CRP level, as an inflammation marker, may be associated with the incidence of AF. Inflammation as measured by CRP was also reduced in the carnitine group, compared with the control group.",

        "Abstract":"UNLABELLED: Essentials Routine monitoring is unnecessary but measuring dabigatran levels is helpful in certain situations. We compared ecarin chromogenic assay (STA-ECA-II) and dilute thrombin time (dTT) in patient samples. Both tests provided accurate measurements over a wide range of dabigatran concentrations. Adoption of STA-ECA-II and dTT into routine clinical practice will improve patient care.\nSUMMARY: Background Although routine coagulation monitoring is unnecessary, measuring plasma dabigatran concentrations can be useful for detecting drug accumulation in renal failure or overdose, assessing the contribution of dabigatran to serious bleeding, planning the timing of urgent surgery or intervention, or determining the suitability for thrombolytic therapy for acute ischemic stroke. Dabigatran concentrations can be quantified using chromogenic or clot-based tests, such as the ecarin chromogenic assay (ECA) and the diluted thrombin time (dTT), respectively. Objective The purpose of this study was to compare the results of these assays with dabigatran concentrations measured by the reference standard of mass spectrometry in samples from 50 dabigatran-treated patients collected at peak and trough after at least 4 months of drug intake. Methods Drug levels measured with either the STA Ecarin Chromogenic Assay-II (STA-ECA-II) or dTT were linearly correlated with those determined by mass spectrometry over a wide range of concentrations. Results and Conclusions For detection of levels below 50 ng mL both tests have specificities of at least 96%, suggesting that they accurately detect even low levels of drug. Therefore, regardless of whether a chromogenic or clot-based platform is preferred, the STA-ECA-II and dTT are useful tests for measuring dabigatran concentrations. Unfortunately, neither test is licensed by the United States Food and Drug Administration. Although approved in other jurisdictions, the dTT and STA-ECA-II are not widely or rapidly available in most hospitals. Therefore, cooperation between regulators and hospitals is urgently needed to render these tests readily available to inform patient care.",

        "Published":null,
        "Abstract":"BACKGROUND: Atherosclerotic renal artery stenosis reduces renal blood flow (RBF) and amplifies stenotic kidney hypoxia. Revascularization with percutaneous transluminal renal angioplasty (PTRA) and stenting often fails to recover renal function, possibly because of ischemia\/reperfusion injury developing after PTRA. Elamipretide is a mitochondrial-targeted peptide that binds to cardiolipin and stabilizes mitochondrial function. We tested the hypothesis that elamipretide plus PTRA would improve renal function, oxygenation, and RBF in patients with atherosclerotic renal artery stenosis undergoing PTRA.\nMETHODS AND RESULTS: Inpatient studies were performed in patients with severe atherosclerotic renal artery stenosis scheduled for PTRA. Patients were treated before and during PTRA with elamipretide (0.05 mg\/kg per hour intravenous infusion, n=6) or placebo (n=8). Stenotic kidney cortical\/medullary perfusion and RBF were measured using contrast-enhanced multidetector CT, and renal oxygenation by 3-T blood oxygen level-dependent magnetic resonance imaging before and 3 months after PTRA. Age and basal glomerular filtration rate did not differ between groups. Blood oxygen level-dependent imaging demonstrated increased fractional hypoxia 24 hours after angiography and stenting in placebo (+47%) versus elamipretide (-6%). These were reverted to baseline 3 months later. Stenotic kidney RBF rose (202±29-262±115 mL\/min; =0.04) 3 months after PTRA in the elamipretide-treated group only. Over 3 months, systolic blood pressure decreased, and estimated glomerular filtration rate increased (=0.003) more in the elamipretide group than in the placebo group (=0.11).\nCONCLUSIONS: Adjunctive elamipretide during PTRA was associated with attenuated postprocedural hypoxia, increased RBF, and improved kidney function in this pilot trial. These data support a role for targeted mitochondrial protection to minimize procedure-associated ischemic injury and to improve outcomes of revascularization for human atherosclerotic renal artery stenosis.\nCLINICAL TRIAL REGISTRATION: URL: https:\/\/www.clinicaltrials.gov.

        "Abstract":"OBJECTIVES: Compared with percutaneous coronary intervention (PCI), coronary artery bypass grafting (CABG) appears to be a promising revascularization strategy for multivessel coronary disease. Trials comparing these treatments have not used second-generation drug-eluting stents (2nd DES). We conducted a retrospective evaluation of both treatments using a propensity score-matched analysis (PSMA).\nMETHODS: A total of 537 patients with three-vessel with\/without left-main-trunk coronary artery disease underwent CABG (n = 239) or primary PCI using 2nd DES (298) at a single institution. PSMA resulted in 168 matched pairs. For both treatments, Kaplan-Meier analysis and Cox regression were used to compare all-cause mortality, cardiac death, myocardial infarction (MI), stroke rates and target-vessel revascularization (TVR).\nRESULTS: The CABG group included sicker patients with renal dysfunction, peripheral vascular disease, low ejection fraction and current smokers than those in the PCI group. After PSMA, both groups were well matched in all parameters. Mean follow-up (months) was 32 in CABG and 35 in PCI. In the unmatched patient population, there was no difference in the incidence of all-cause death, cardiac death, MI, or stroke but the incidence of TVR was significantly higher in the PCI group [hazard ratio (HR) 4.63; 95% confidence interval (95% CI) 2.43-8.82; P < 0.001] and, after PSMA, the incidence of all-cause death (HR 2.71; 95% CI 1.14-6.46; P = 0.019) and TVR (HR 9.0; 95% CI 2.73-29.67; P < 0.001) was significantly higher in the PCI group than in the CABG group.\nCONCLUSIONS: In patients with three-vessel coronary artery disease, CABG is associated with better survival and less revascularization than PCI using 2nd DES at mid-term results.",

However, very few studies have been conducted to examine its implementation in non-Western real-world practice. In this study, we sought to describe statin prescription patterns in relation to patient characteristics in a Japanese multicenter percutaneous coronary intervention (PCI) registry as a foundation for quality improvement. We studied 15,024 patients that were prospectively enrolled in the Japan Cardiovascular Database-Keio interhospital Cardiovascular Study Registry from January 2009 to August 2014. The overall discharge statin non-prescription rate was 15.2%, without significant interhospital (MOR = 1.01) or annual differences (MOR = 1.13) observed. Hierarchical multivariable logistic regression analysis accounting for regional differences revealed that the presence of chronic kidney disease was associated with higher rates of statin non-prescription (OR 1.87, 95% confidence interval, 1.69-2.08, p value <0.001), and higher age (per 1-year increase) showed a trend for prescription of low-intensity statin (OR 1.00, 95% confidence interval, 1.00-1.01, p value = 0.045) within the subset of PCI patients (N = 4,853) enrolled after the year 2011.

        "Abstract":"IMPORTANCE: Low cardiac output syndrome after cardiac surgery is associated with high morbidity and mortality in patients with impaired left ventricular function.\nOBJECTIVE: To assess the ability of preoperative levosimendan to prevent postoperative low cardiac output syndrome.\nDESIGN, SETTING, AND PARTICIPANTS: Randomized, double-blind, placebo-controlled trial conducted in 13 French cardiac surgical centers. Patients with a left ventricular ejection fraction less than or equal to 40% and scheduled for isolated or combined coronary artery bypass grafting with cardiopulmonary bypass were enrolled from June 2013 until May 2015 and followed during 6 months (last follow-up, November 30, 2015).\nINTERVENTIONS: Patients were assigned to a 24-hour infusion of levosimendan 0.1 µg\/kg\/min (n = 167) or placebo (n = 168) initiated after anesthetic induction.\nMAIN OUTCOMES AND MEASURES: Composite end point reflecting low cardiac output syndrome with need for a catecholamine infusion 48 hours after study drug initiation, need for a left ventricular mechanical assist device or failure to wean from it at 96 hours after study drug initiation when the device was inserted preoperatively, or need for renal replacement therapy at any time postoperatively. It was hypothesized that levosimendan would reduce the incidence of this composite end point by 15% in comparison with placebo.\nRESULTS: Among 336 randomized patients (mean age, 68 years; 16% women), 333 completed the trial. The primary end point occurred in 87 patients (52%) in the levosimendan group and 101 patients (61%) in the placebo group (absolute risk difference taking into account center effect, -7% [95% CI, -17% to 3%]; P = .15). Predefined subgroup analyses found no interaction with ejection fraction less than 30%, type of surgery, and preoperative use of β-blockers, intra-aortic balloon pump, or catecholamines. The prevalence of hypotension (57% vs 48%), atrial fibrillation (50% vs 40%), and other adverse events did not significantly differ between levosimendan and placebo.\nCONCLUSIONS AND RELEVANCE: Among patients with low ejection fraction who were undergoing coronary artery bypass grafting with cardiopulmonary bypass, levosimendan compared with placebo did not result in a significant difference in the composite end point of prolonged catecholamine infusion, use of left ventricular mechanical assist device, or renal replacement therapy. These findings do not support the use of levosimendan for this indication.\nTRIAL REGISTRATION: EudraCT Number: 2012-000232-25; clinicaltrials.gov Identifier: NCT02184819.",

        "Abstract":"BACKGROUND: Increased platelet aggregation during antiplatelet therapy may predict cardiovascular events in patients with coronary artery disease. The majority of these patients receive aspirin monotherapy. We aimed to investigate whether high platelet-aggregation levels predict cardiovascular events in stable coronary artery disease patients treated with aspirin.\nMETHODS AND RESULTS: We included 900 stable coronary artery disease patients with either previous myocardial infarction, type 2 diabetes mellitus, or both. All patients received single antithrombotic therapy with 75 mg aspirin daily. Platelet aggregation was evaluated 1 hour after aspirin intake using the VerifyNow Aspirin Assay (Accriva Diagnostics) and Multiplate Analyzer (Roche; agonists: arachidonic acid and collagen). Adherence to aspirin was confirmed by serum thromboxane B. The primary end point was the composite of nonfatal myocardial infarction, ischemic stroke, and cardiovascular death. At 3-year follow-up, 78 primary end points were registered. The primary end point did not occur more frequently in patients with high platelet-aggregation levels (first versus fourth quartile) assessed by VerifyNow (hazard ratio: 0.5 [95% CI, 0.3-1.1], =0.08) or Multiplate using arachidonic acid (hazard ratio: 1.0 [95% CI, 0.5-2.1], =0.92) or collagen (hazard ratio: 1.4 [95% CI, 0.7-2.8], =0.38). Similar results were found for the composite secondary end point (nonfatal myocardial infarction, ischemic stroke, stent thrombosis, and all-cause death) and the single end points. Thromboxane B levels did not predict any end points. Renal insufficiency was the only clinical risk factor predicting the primary and secondary end points.\nCONCLUSIONS: This study is the largest to investigate platelet aggregation in stable coronary artery disease patients receiving aspirin as single antithrombotic therapy.

        "Abstract":"The benefit of statin therapy in patients with advanced chronic kidney disease remains uncertain. Randomized trials have questioned the efficacy of the drug in improving outcomes for on-dialysis populations, and many patients with end-stage renal disease are not currently taking statins. This study aimed to investigate the impact of statin use on survival of patients with vascular access performed at a vascular center for chronic dialysis. Consecutive end-stage renal disease patients admitted for vascular access surgery in 2006 to 2013 were reviewed. Information on therapy was retrieved and patients on statins were compared to those who were not on statins. Primary endpoint was 5-year survival. Independent predictors of mortality were assessed with Cox regression analysis adjusting for covariates (ie, age, sex, hyperlipidemia, hypertension, cardiac disease, cerebrovascular disease, chronic obstructive pulmonary disease, obesity, diabetes, and statins). Three hundred fifty-nine patients (230 males; mean age 68.9 ± 13.7 years) receiving 554 vascular accesses were analyzed: 127 (35.4%) were on statins. Use of statins was more frequent in patients with hypertension (89.8% v 81%; P = .034), hyperlipidemia (52.4% v 6.2%; P < .0001), coronary disease (54.1% v 42.6%; P = .043), diabetes (39.4% v 21.6%; P = .001), and obesity (11.6% v 2.0%; P < .0001). Mean follow-up was 35 months. Kaplan-Meier survival rates at 3 and 5 years were 84.4% and 75.9% for patients taking statins and 77.0% and 65.1% for those not taking statins (P = .18). Cox regression analysis selected statins therapy as the only independent negative predictor (odds ratio = 0.55; 95% confidence interval = 0.32-0.95; P = .032) of mortality, while age was an independent positive predictor (odds ratio = 1.05; 95% confidence interval = 1.03-1.08; P < .0001). Vascular access patency was comparable in statin takers and those not taking statins (P = .60). Use of statins might halve the risk of all-cause mortality at 5 years in adult patients with vascular access for chronic dialysis. Statins therapy should be considered in end-stage renal disease populations requiring dialysis access placement.",

This bioengineered layer attracts circulating endothelial progenitor cells that can differentiate into normal endothelium. Rapid endothelialisation of the stent might allow safe short dual antiplatelet therapy. We aim to assess clinical outcomes in patients treated with this novel device at 2-year follow-up.\nMETHODS: A total of 1000 patients were included in the REMEDEE Registry to evaluate clinical outcomes after treatment with the dual-therapy stent. This prospective, multicentre, European registry included all-comers patients, which resulted in a high-risk patient population. Target lesion failure (TLF), a combined endpoint consisting of cardiac death, target vessel myocardial infarction (tv-MI) and target lesion revascularisation (TLR), at 2-year follow-up was the primary focus of this analysis. Subgroup analyses were performed according to diabetes mellitus (DM), gender, age, acute coronary syndrome, smoking, hypertension, hypercholesterolaemia, previous stroke, peripheral vascular disease and chronic renal failure.\nRESULTS: TLF at 2 years was observed in 84 patients (8.5%), with 3.0% cardiac death, 1.2% tv-MI and 5.9% TLR. Definite stent thrombosis at 2 years was 0.6%. In the presence of DM or chronic renal failure, a higher TLF was observed.\nCONCLUSIONS: The dual-therapy stent shows favourable clinical outcomes from 12 months onwards.

        "Abstract":"INTRODUCTION AND OBJECTIVES: Current guidelines on the treatment of blood cholesterol recommend continuous maintenance of high-intensity statin treatment in drug-eluting stent (DES)-treated patients. However, high-intensity statin treatment is frequently underused in clinical practice after stabilization of DES-treated patients. Currently, the impact of continuous high-intensity statin treatment on the incidence of late adverse events in these patients is unknown. We investigated whether high-intensity statin treatment reduces late adverse events in clinically stable patients on aspirin monotherapy 12 months after DES implantation.\nMETHODS: Clinically stable patients who underwent DES implantation 12 months previously and received aspirin monotherapy were randomly assigned to receive either high-intensity (40mg atorvastatin, n = 1000) or low-intensity (20mg pravastatin, n = 1000) statin treatment. The primary endpoint was adverse clinical events at 12-month follow-up (a composite of all death, myocardial infarction, revascularization, stent thrombosis, stroke, renal deterioration, intervention for peripheral artery disease, and admission for cardiac events).\nRESULTS: The primary endpoint at 12-month follow-up occurred in 25 patients (2.5%) receiving high-intensity statin treatment and in 40 patients (4.1%) receiving low-intensity statin treatment (HR, 0.58; 95%CI, 0.36-0.92; P = .018). This difference was mainly driven by a lower rate of cardiac death (0 vs 0.4%, P = .025) and nontarget vessel myocardial infarction (0.1 vs 0.7%, P = .033) in the high-intensity statin treatment group.\nCONCLUSIONS: Among clinically stable DES-treated patients on aspirin monotherapy, high-intensity statin treatment significantly reduced late adverse events compared with low-intensity statin treatment.\nCLINICAL TRIAL REGISTRATION: URL: http:\/\/www.clinicaltrials.gov.

        "Abstract":"BACKGROUND: The percutaneous infrainguinal stent (PSI) register study aimed to collate all percutaneous endovascular procedures for infrainguinal peripheral arterial occlusive disease (PAOD) conducted in 74 German vascular centers between September and November 2015 (3 months). In order to obtain representative results all consecutive treatment procedures had to be submitted by the participating trial centers.\nMATERIAL AND METHODS: This was a prospective, nonrandomized multicenter study design. All patients suffering from intermittent claudication (IC, Fontaine stage II) or critical limb ischemia (CLI, Fontaine stages III and IV) were included. Trial centers with less than 5 cases reported within the 3‑month trial period or centers that could not ensure the submission of all treated patients were excluded.\nRESULTS: In the final assessment 2798 treated cases from 74 trial centers were reported of which 65 (87.8 %) centers were under the leadership of a vascular surgeon. Approximately 33 % of the interventions in centers under the leadership of vascular surgeons were conducted by radiologists. Risk factors, especially chronic renal disease, diabetes and cardiac risk factors were significantly different between patients with IC and CLI. Of the patients with Fontaine stage II PAOD 41.3 % had 3 patent crural vessels compared to only 10.8 % of patients with Fontaine stage IV. With respect to peri-interventional complications, percutaneous endovascular treatment of IC was a safe procedure with severe complications in less than 1 % and no fatalities. Only 4.5 % of the procedures were conducted under ambulatory conditions. In the supragenual region self-expanding bare metal stents, standard percutaneous transluminal angioplasty (PTA) and drug-coated balloons were the most frequently used procedures. For interventions below the knee, standard PTA was the most commonly employed treatment.\nCONCLUSION: The main aim of the PSI study was to obtain a realistic picture of percutaneous endovascular techniques used to treat suprapopliteal and infrapopliteal PAOD lesions and to describe the treatment procedures used by vascular specialists in Germany. To investigate the change in trends for treatment over time, this study has to be repeated in the future in order to test how quickly the results of randomized studies can be implemented in practice.",

        "Abstract":"2\nOBJECTIVE Wound infections following spinal surgery for deformity place a high toll on patients, providers, and the health care system. The prophylactic application of intraoperative vancomycin powder has been shown to lower the infection risk after thoracolumbar decompression and fusion for deformity correction. The purpose of this study was to assess the microbiological patterns of postoperative surgical site infections (SSIs) after prophylactic use of vancomycin powder in adult patients undergoing spinal deformity surgery. METHODS All cases involving adult patients who underwent spinal deformity reconstruction at Duke University Medical Center between 2011 and 2013 with a minimum of 3 months of clinical follow-up were retrospectively reviewed. In all cases included in the study, crystalline vancomycin powder was applied to the surgical bed for infection prophylaxis. Baseline characteristics, operative details, rates of wound infection, and microbiological data for each case were gathered by direct medical record review. RESULTS A total of 1200 consecutive spine operations were performed for deformity between 2011 and 2013. Review of the associated records demonstrated 34 cases of SSI, yielding an SSI rate of 2.83%. The patients' mean age (± SD) was 62.08 ± 14.76 years. The patients' mean body mass index was 30.86 ± 7.15 kg\/m, and 29.41% had a history of diabetes. The average dose of vancomycin powder was 1.41 ± 2.77 g (range 1-7 g). Subfascial drains were placed in 88% of patients. All SSIs occurred within 30 days of surgery, with deep wound infections accounting for 50%. In 74% of the SSIs cultures were positive, with about half the organisms being gram negative, such as Citrobacter freundii, Proteus mirabilis, Morganella morgani, and Pseudomonas aeruginosa. There were no adverse clinical outcomes related to the local application of vancomycin. CONCLUSIONS Our study suggests that in the setting of prophylactic vancomycin powder use, the preponderance of SSIs are caused by gram-negative organisms or are polymicrobial. Further randomized control trials of prophylactic adjunctive measures are warranted to help guide the choice of empirical antibiotic therapy while awaiting culture data.",

Patients taking metformin took the drug until the day of surgery and resumed taking it 3 h after extubation.\nRESULTS: There were no differences in clinical outcomes or complications between groups. Serial measurement of cardiac, liver, and kidney biomarkers were similar between groups. The mean peak lactic acid level was significantly higher in the non-metformin users (5.4 ± 2.6 vs. 7.4 ± 4.1 mmol\/l; P = 0.001). Multivariable logistic regression analysis identified the need for vasopressor administration as an independent predictor of lactic acidosis (odds ratio: 7.3, 95% confidence interval: 2.5-20.6; P < 0.001).\nCONCLUSION: In the absence of risk factors associated with persistent lactic acidosis, such as shock or acute kidney or liver injury, continued peri-operative metformin administration was not associated with the occurrence of lactic acidosis in patients undergoing CABG. Elevated lactic acid levels seem to be directly related to tissue anoxia caused by escalating vasopressor support after surgery.",

        "Abstract":"BACKGROUND: There are limited data on the impact of chronic moderate or severe anaemia on the clinical outcomes of patients with acute coronary syndrome undergoing coronary angiography or percutaneous coronary intervention.\nMETHODS: We retrospectively compared two groups of consecutive patients with acute coronary syndrome according to their haemoglobin level on admission. The research group ( n=89) had a haemoglobin level of 10.9 g\/dl or less and a control group ( n=79) of age-matched patients had a haemoglobin level greater than 10.9 g\/dl. We studied drug therapy before, during and after intervention, and performed 1-year follow-up of bleeding complications according to the Bleeding Academic Research Consortium criteria, all-cause mortality and re-infarction, as well as haemoglobin level on discharge, 6 and 12 months after admission.\nRESULTS: Compared to controls, a haemoglobin level less than 10.9 g\\dl on admission is associated with a higher rate of major bleeding: 26 patients (32%) versus none in the control group ( P<0.001); and the use of packed red blood cell (RBC) transfusion: nine patients (11.7%) versus none in the control group ( P=0.003) within the first 6 months post-catheterisation. However, the re-infarction rate and mortality were similar in the study and control groups: 9.2% versus 9.7% ( P=0.915) and 12.6% versus 8.9% ( P=0.434), accordingly.\nCONCLUSIONS: Chronic moderate or severe anaemia in patients with acute coronary syndrome undergoing coronary angiography or percutaneous coronary intervention is associated with a substantially increased risk of bleeding in the first 6 months.

        "Abstract":"OBJECTIVE: The aim of this study was to evaluate whether preoperative diabetes management can improve glycemic control and clinical outcomes after elective surgery.\nBACKGROUND: There is lack of data on the importance of diabetes treatment before elective surgery. Diabetes is often ignored before surgery and aggressively treated afterwards.\nMETHODS: Patients with diabetes were identified and treated proactively before their scheduled surgeries. Data for all elective surgeries over 2 years before and 2 years after implementation of the program were collected.\nRESULTS: Out of 31,392 patients undergoing first surgery, 3909 had diabetes; 2072 before and 1835 after the program. Mean blood glucose on the day of surgery was 146.4 ± 51.9 mg\/dL before and 139.9 ± 45.6 mg\/dL after the program (P = 0.0028). Proportion of patients seen by the inpatient diabetes team increased. Mean blood glucose during hospital stay was 166.7 ± 42.9 mg\/dL before and 158.3 ± 46.6 mg\/dL after program (P < 0.0001). The proportion of patients with hypoglycemic episodes (<50 mg\/dL) was 4.93% before and 2.48% after the program (P < 0.0001). Length of hospital stay (LOS) decreased among patients with diabetes (4.8 ± 5.3 to 4.6 ± 4.3 days; P = 0.01) and remained unchanged among patients without diabetes (4.0 ± 4.5 and 4.1 ± 4.8, respectively; P = 0.42). Changes in intravenous antibiotic use, patients discharged to home, renal insufficiency, myocardial infarction, stroke, and in-hospital mortality were similar among diabetic and nondiabetic groups.\nCONCLUSIONS: Preoperative and inpatient diabetes management improves glycemic control on the day of surgery and postoperatively and decreases the incidence of hypoglycemia. These changes may eventually improve clinical outcomes. Although statistically significant, the decrease in LOS was of equivocal clinical significance in this study.",

        "Abstract":"PURPOSE: Favorable long-term outcomes of the Zilver PTX drug-eluting stent (DES) in femoropopliteal lesions have been demonstrated. Chronic renal failure (CRF) has been shown to be a risk factor for restenosis and decreased limb salvage. The results of the DES in patients with CRF have not previously been reported. This study compares the results with the DES in patients with CRF and those without CRF.\nMETHODS: This retrospective analysis from the Zilver PTX Japan Post-Market Surveillance Study included 321 patients with CRF and 584 patients without CRF. Outcomes included freedom from target lesion revascularization (TLR) and patency.\nRESULTS: Of the patients included in this subgroup analysis, 2-year data were available for 209 patients in the CRF group and 453 patients in the non-CRF group. The two groups were similar in terms of lesion length and the frequency of in-stent restenosis. Critical limb ischemia, severe calcification, and diabetes were more common in patients with CRF, whereas total occlusion was more common in patients without CRF. Freedom from TLR rates were 81.4 versus 84.9% (p = 0.24), and patency rates were 70.7 versus 70.3% (p = 0.95) in patients with and without CRF at 2 years, respectively.\nCONCLUSION: This is the first comparative study of the DES in femoropopliteal artery lesions in patients with and without CRF.

        "Abstract":"OBJECTIVES: This study evaluated the usability and contrast volume savings of the novel DyeVert™ System.\nBACKGROUND: During coronary diagnostic and interventional procedures, a substantial portion of injected contrast does not contribute to vessel imaging due to reflux into the ascending aorta. Contrast volume is the primary physician modifiable risk factor for prevention of contrast-induced acute kidney injury CI-AKI which is a frequent complication in patients undergoing coronary angiographic procedures and is related to increases in morbidity, mortality, and healthcare costs.\nMETHODS: In this pilot trial, 44 patients undergoing coronary diagnostic and\/or percutaneous coronary intervention (PCI) procedures were enrolled in two centers. All procedures were conducted using a manual manifold injection setup and the DyeVert System, which facilitates the diversion of excess contrast volume prior to injection into the patient. Direct measurements of both the amount of contrast that was attempted to be injected and the actual volume injected into the patient were taken.\nRESULTS: The difference between the two amounts indicated the volume saved. Procedure types included 34 diagnostic studies and 10 PCI. The mean percent volume saved by the DyeVert System was 47%, with a corresponding P value of <0.0001 achieving the pre-specified level of greater than 15% of contrast media being saved. Mean volume savings were similar for both diagnostic (47 ± 9%) and PCI (50 ± 9%) procedures. Image quality was good in 43\/44 (98%) patients.\nCONCLUSIONS: The DyeVert System substantially decreases contrast delivered to patients during diagnostic or interventional coronary procedures while maintaining adequate image quality. © 2017 Wiley Periodicals, Inc.",

        "Abstract":"BACKGROUND: Growth differentiation factor-15 (GDF-15) is related to major bleeding when measured at initial presentation in patients with acute coronary syndromes (ACSs) treated with dual antiplatelet therapy. It is unknown whether follow-up measurements provide additional information. The objective of this study was to investigate whether GDF-15 measured 1 month after an ACS provides additional information beyond the baseline levels with regard to the risk of major bleeding.\nMETHODS AND RESULTS: GDF-15 was measured at baseline and at 1 month after an ACS in 4049 patients included in the PLATelet inhibition and patient Outcomes (PLATO) trial. The association between 1-month GDF-15 level and non-coronary artery bypass grafting surgery-related major bleeding was assessed by a multivariable Cox model, adjusting for baseline GDF-15, age, anemia, impaired renal function, history of gastrointestinal bleeding, and sex. Elevated GDF-15 (>1800 ng\/L) at 1 month was associated with an increased risk of non-coronary artery bypass grafting-related major bleeding (3.9% versus 1.2%; hazard ratio, 3.38; 95% CI, 1.89-6.06), independent of baseline GDF-15. Patients who had elevated GDF-15 levels at baseline and subsequent nonelevated GDF-15 at 1 month had a similar risk as patients who had nonelevated levels at both measurements.\nCONCLUSIONS: GDF-15 at 1 month after an ACS is related to the risk of bleeding during DAPT and provides additional information on the bleeding risk beyond baseline GDF-15 levels. GDF-15 levels may therefore be useful as part of decision support concerning long-term antithrombotic treatment in patients post-ACS.\nCLINICAL TRIAL REGISTRATION: URL: http:\/\/www.clinicaltrials.gov.

We pooled the odds ratios from individual studies and conducted heterogeneity, quality assessment and publication bias analyses.\nRESULTS: A total of 11 studies with 29,246 patients were included (17,928 DES patients; 11,318 CABG). Compared with CABG, pooled analysis of studies showed DES had higher long-term all-cause mortality (OR, 1.22; p<0.00001), cardiac mortality (OR, 1.29; p<0.00001), myocardial infarction (OR, 1.89; p=0.02), repeat revascularization (OR, 3.47; p<0.00001) and major adverse cardiac and cerebrovascular events (MACCE) (OR, 2.00; p=0.002), but lower short-term all-cause mortality (OR, 0.33; p<0.00001) and cerebrovascular accident (OR, 0.64; p=0.0001). Subgroup analysis restricted to patients with end-stage renal disease (ESRD) yielded similar results, but no significant differences were found regarding CVA and MACCE.\nCONCLUSIONS: CABG for patients with CKD and MVD had advantages over PCI-DES in long-term all-cause mortality, MI, repeat revascularization and MACCE, but the substantial disadvantage in short-term mortality and CVA.

It is expected that the use of newer-generation drug-eluting stents (DES) would improve clinical outcomes in these patients. We evaluated the impact of CKD on clinical outcomes in diabetic patients undergoing PCI using newer-generation DES in a real-world setting.\nSUBJECTS AND METHODS: A total of 887 patients who underwent PCI with newer-generation DES and who had a history of DM or HbA1c >6.5% at the time of hospitalization were analyzed. These patients were divided into groups without CKD (n=549) and with CKD (n=338). Among survivors at discharge, a patient-oriented composite outcome (POCO) including all-cause mortality, myocardial infarction (MI), and revascularization was evaluated, together with a device-oriented composite outcome (DOCO) including cardiac death, target vessel-related MI, and target lesion revascularization at a follow-up period of one year.\nRESULTS: The incidence of POCO (5.4% vs. 14.0%, log-rank p<0.001) and DOCO (1.1% vs. 4.1%, log-rank p<0.001) was higher in patients with CKD. According to multivariate analysis, which was adjusted for baseline differences in demographic, clinical, and angiographic factors, the presence of CKD was an independent predictor of POCO (hazard ratio [HR]: 1.82, 95% confidence interval [CI]: 1.07 to 3.12), but not of DOCO (HR 2.08, 95% CI: 0.69-6.28).\nCONCLUSION: In DM patients, CKD is an independent and powerful predictor of patient-related outcomes, but not of device-related outcomes in the era of newer-generation DES.",

Recently, two large-scale studies on the use of hydroxyethyl starches (HES) in the intensive care setting have been published, which have caused a huge shift in the daily practice of volume therapy. These results have been applied to patients outside intensive care. The aim of this study was to evaluate the impact this change has had on the outcomes in a large population of cardiac surgery patients, with a focus on the type of colloid infusion.\nDESIGN: A prospective, registered, observational study, using propensity score matching.\nSETTING: Cohort study from 3 university hospitals using a common registry.\nPARTICIPANTS: The study comprised 17,742 patients who were referred for cardiac surgery from 2007 to 2014.\nINTERVENTIONS: Patients were divided in groups according to perioperative fluid replacement with either crystalloids or colloids. The colloid group was further divided into HES or human albumin (HA). Analyses were based on the following 3 subsections: HES versus crystalloids, HA versus crystalloids, and HES versus HA, with use of propensity score matching or direct matching of cases. Primary outcome parameters were 30-day and 6-month mortality, new postoperative renal replacement therapy, and new cardiac ischemic events.\nMEASUREMENTS AND MAIN RESULTS: The groups were fully comparable in individual analyses. The use of HES had no impact on new dialysis and 30-day mortality. A Cox proportional regression analysis showed that HES had no impact on 6-month mortality and new postoperative ischemic events. When comparing HA with crystalloid use, a significantly increased risk in crude analysis was demonstrated on all outcome parameters; and when comparing HA with HES, a significantly higher risk was observed in HA patients in mortality parameters and new postoperative, but after adjustment, only the risk of new postoperative dialysis persisted.\nCONCLUSION: This study underlined the difficulties in establishing hardcore outcome data, even in large cohort studies. The findings seemed to diminish the magnitude of risk when using HES in cardiac surgery patients and seriously questioned the choice of HA when a plasma expander is needed.",

We created a cohort of 4,687 adults who underwent cardiac catheterization, had a serum creatinine value measured within 30 days, and had more than one vessel with ≥50% stenosis. We used Cox proportional hazard regression modeling weighted by the inverse probability of treatment to examine the association between 4 treatment strategies (medical management, percutaneous coronary intervention [PCI] with bare metal stent, PCI with drug-eluting stent, and coronary artery bypass grafting [CABG]) and mortality among patients across categories of estimated glomerular filtration rate; secondary outcome was a composite of mortality, myocardial infarction, or revascularization. Compared with medical management, CABG was associated with a reduced risk of death for patients of any nondialysis CKD severity (hazard ratio [HR] range 0.43 to 0.59). There were no significant mortality differences between CABG and PCI, except a decreased death risk in CABG-treated CKD patients (HR range 0.54 to 0.55). Compared with medical management and PCI, CABG was associated with a lower risk of death, myocardial infarction, or revascularization in nondialysis CKD patients (HR range 0.41 to 0.64). There were similar associations between decreased estimated glomerular filtration rate and increased mortality across all multivessel coronary artery disease patient treatment groups. When accounting for treatment propensity, surgical revascularization was associated with improved outcomes in patients of all CKD severities. A prospective randomized trial in CKD patients is required to confirm our findings.",

        "Abstract":"BACKGROUND: Levosimendan is an inotropic agent that has been shown in small studies to prevent or treat the low cardiac output syndrome after cardiac surgery.\nMETHODS: In a multicenter, randomized, placebo-controlled, phase 3 trial, we evaluated the efficacy and safety of levosimendan in patients with a left ventricular ejection fraction of 35% or less who were undergoing cardiac surgery with the use of cardiopulmonary bypass. Patients were randomly assigned to receive either intravenous levosimendan (at a dose of 0.2 μg per kilogram of body weight per minute for 1 hour, followed by a dose of 0.1 μg per kilogram per minute for 23 hours) or placebo, with the infusion started before surgery. The two primary end points were a four-component composite of death through day 30, renal-replacement therapy through day 30, perioperative myocardial infarction through day 5, or use of a mechanical cardiac assist device through day 5; and a two-component composite of death through day 30 or use of a mechanical cardiac assist device through day 5.\nRESULTS: A total of 882 patients underwent randomization, 849 of whom received levosimendan or placebo and were included in the modified intention-to-treat population. The four-component primary end point occurred in 105 of 428 patients (24.5%) assigned to receive levosimendan and in 103 of 421 (24.5%) assigned to receive placebo (adjusted odds ratio, 1.00; 99% confidence interval [CI], 0.66 to 1.54; P=0.98). The two-component primary end point occurred in 56 patients (13.1%) assigned to receive levosimendan and in 48 (11.4%) assigned to receive placebo (adjusted odds ratio, 1.18; 96% CI, 0.76 to 1.82; P=0.45). The rate of adverse events did not differ significantly between the two groups.\nCONCLUSIONS: Prophylactic levosimendan did not result in a rate of the short-term composite end point of death, renal-replacement therapy, perioperative myocardial infarction, or use of a mechanical cardiac assist device that was lower than the rate with placebo among patients with a reduced left ventricular ejection fraction who were undergoing cardiac surgery with the use of cardiopulmonary bypass.

This clinical trial was performed to assess the preventive effect of oral nicorandil on CIN in high-risk patients undergoing cardiac catheterization.\nMETHODS: In this prospective, randomized, controlled trial, 128 patients with at least two risk factors for CIN undergoing elective percutaneous coronary intervention (PCI) were randomly assigned to either the nicorandil group or the control group. Patients in the nicorandil group (n = 64) received 10 mg nicorandil, daily from 30 min before and up to 3 days after procedure and intravenous hydration for 2 h before and 6 h after the procedure, whereas patients in the control group (n = 64) just received intravenous hydration. Serum creatinine (SCr) was measured before contrast exposure and at 72 h. CIN was defined as an increase of 25% in SCr or > 0.5 mg\/dL 72 h after contrast administration.\nRESULTS: Contrast-induced nephropathy occurred in 14 out of 64 (21.9%) patients in the control group and in 3 out of 64 (4.7%) patients in the nicorandil group. There was a significant difference in the incidence of CIN between the two groups at 72 h after administering the radiocontrast agent (p = 0.008). Moreover, there were significant differences between the two groups in SCr and estimated glomerular filtration rate 72 h after radiocontrast administration (p < 0.05).\nCONCLUSIONS: The findings revealed that oral nicorandil had substantial efficacy over hydration protocol for the development of CIN in high-risk patients undergoing cardiac catheterization.",

This early postmarketing observational study evaluated the safety and efficacy of short-term prasugrel use in patients with acute coronary syndrome (ACS) in real-world clinical settings in Japan. From May 2014 to January 2015, we enrolled consecutive patients with ACS requiring percutaneous coronary intervention in each institution. Each patient started prasugrel treatment ≥1 month before the end of the study period. Safety outcomes included incidence rates of adverse drug reactions (ADRs) and bleeding adverse events (AEs). Efficacy outcomes were incidence rates of cardiovascular events (including major adverse cardiovascular events [MACE]). Case report forms were collected from 749 patients, 732 of whom were eligible for the safety and efficacy analysis sets. Approximately 95% of patients had a prasugrel loading\/maintenance dose of 20 mg\/3.75 mg\/day. The incidences of ADRs and bleeding AEs were 8.6 and 6.4%, respectively. Twelve patients experienced major bleeding AEs; approximately 60% (seven patients) of which were gastrointestinal disorders. The incidence of bleeding AEs was significantly higher primarily in patients of female sex, aged ≥75 years, with low body weight (≤50 kg), severe cardiovascular disease, or severe renal impairment. The incidence of MACE was 1.9% during prasugrel treatment, and 3.1% at the end of the study period.

We investigated if a 4 g\/kg per minute continuous dopamine infusion administered after brain-death confirmation affects long-term graft survival and examined the exposure-response relationship with treatment duration.\nDESIGN, SETTING, PARTICIPANTS, & MEASUREMENTS: Five-year follow-up of 487 renal transplant patients from 60 European centers who had participated in the randomized, multicenter trial of dopamine donor pretreatment between 2004 and 2007 (ClinicalTrials.gov identifier: NCT00115115).\nRESULTS: Follow-up was complete in 99.2%. Graft survival was 72.6% versus 68.7% (=0.34), and 83.3% versus 80.4% (=0.42) after death-censoring in treatment and control arms according to trial assignment. Although infusion times varied substantially in the treatment arm (range 0-32.2 hours), duration of the dopamine infusion and all-cause graft failure exhibited an exposure-response relationship (hazard ratio, 0.96; 95% confidence interval [95% CI], 0.92 to 1.00, per hour). Cumulative frequency curves of graft survival and exposure time of the dopamine infusion indicated a maximum response rate at 7.10 hours (95% CI, 6.99 to 7.21), which almost coincided with the optimum infusion time for improvement of early graft function (7.05 hours; 95% CI, 6.92 to 7.18).

Patients with moderate-to-severe CKD (n = 604; 30.7%) were older, more likely to be women, to have hypertension, diabetes, prior MI or PCI, with higher severity of coronary artery disease (CAD), but were less frequently smokers or presenting with stable CAD. After adjustment, the 2-year rates of primary endpoint (composite of death, myocardial infarction and cerebrovascular accident), as well as bleeding and net adverse clinical events were higher in patients with moderate-to-severe CKD. DAPT prolongation at 24-month did not reduce the primary endpoint in both CKD (adj. HR: 0.957; 95% CI 0.652-1.407; P = 0.825) and no-CKD (adj.

Our analysis suggests that CKD should not be a major driver in the decision-making on the duration of DAPT after stent implantation.

The current practice of discontinuing renin-angiotensin-system inhibitors preoperatively may negate their beneficial effects in vulnerable populations, including patients with metabolic syndrome, who exhibit elevated renin-angiotensin system activity. We hypothesized that preoperative ARB use is associated with reduced incidence of postoperative complications, compared with ACEi or no drug, in patients with metabolic syndrome undergoing coronary artery bypass grafting.\nMETHODS: We used propensity matching to derive a cohort of 1,351 patients from 2,998 who underwent coronary artery bypass grafting based on preoperative use of ARBs, ACEis, or no renin-angiotensin-system inhibitors. Our primary end point was a composite of adverse events occurring within 30 days after the operation: new-onset atrial fibrillation\/flutter, arrhythmia requiring cardioversion, perioperative myocardial infarction, acute renal failure, need for dialysis, cerebrovascular accidents, acute respiratory failure, or perioperative death.\nRESULTS: At least one adverse event occurred in 524 (38.8%) of matched cohort patients (1,184 [39.6% of all patients]).

        "Published":"2017-01-09",
        "Abstract":"INTRODUCTION: The Revised Cardiac Risk Index (RCRI) is a popular classification system to estimate patients' risk of postoperative cardiac complications based on preoperative risk factors. Renal impairment, defined as serum creatinine >2.0 mg\/dL (177 µmol\/L), is a component of the RCRI. The estimated glomerular filtration rate has become accepted as a more accurate indicator of renal function. We will externally validate the RCRI in a modern cohort of patients undergoing non-cardiac surgery and update its renal component.\nMETHODS AND ANALYSIS: The Vascular Events in Non-cardiac Surgery Patients Cohort Evaluation (VISION) study is an international prospective cohort study. In this prespecified secondary analysis of VISION, we will test the risk estimation performance of the RCRI in ∼34 000 participants who underwent elective non-cardiac surgery between 2007 and 2013 from 29 hospitals in 15 countries. Using data from the first 20 000 eligible participants (the derivation set), we will derive an optimal threshold for dichotomising preoperative renal function quantified using the Chronic Kidney Disease Epidemiology Collaboration (CKD-Epi) glomerular filtration rate estimating equation in a manner that preserves the original structure of the RCRI. We will also develop a continuous risk estimating equation integrating age and CKD-Epi with existing RCRI risk factors. In the remaining (approximately) 14 000 participants, we will compare the risk estimation for cardiac complications of the original RCRI to this modified version. Cardiac complications will include 30-day non-fatal myocardial infarction, non-fatal cardiac arrest and death due to cardiac causes. We have examined an early sample to estimate the number of events and the distribution of predictors and missing data, but have not seen the validation data at the time of writing.\nETHICS AND DISSEMINATION: The research ethics board at each site approved the VISION protocol prior to recruitment. We will publish our results and make our models available online at http:\/\/www.perioperativerisk.com.\nTRIAL REGISTRATION NUMBER: ClinicalTrials.gov NCT00512109.",

Target lesion failure (TLF) and patient-oriented composite outcomes (POCO, composite of all-cause mortality, all-cause myocardial infarction, or any revascularization) at 1-year follow-up were compared between the DES and DEB groups.\nRESULTS: A total of 628 patients with 697 ISR lesions were treated using newer generation DES (n=409) or DEB (n=219). About 55.1% presented with acute coronary syndrome, and 15.1% showed left ventricular dysfunction.

We compared midterm clinical outcomes following eDES or new-generation DES (nDES) implantation for ostial RCA lesions.\nMETHODS: The study included 150 patients with ostial RCA lesions, 76 treated with eDES and 74 with nDES between January 2005 and September 2013. Study endpoints were major adverse cardiac events (MACEs), specifically all-cause death, target lesion revascularization (TLR), or myocardial infarction within 2 years after PCI.\nRESULTS: Patient characteristics between the groups were similar. The MACE rate was significantly lower in patients treated with nDES compared with those treated with eDES, mainly driven by the lower rates of TLR in the nDES group. Cox regression analysis identified severe chronic kidney disease (CKD) and the use of nDES as the independent predictors of MACE.\nCONCLUSIONS: The implantation of nDES for ostial RCA lesions significantly reduced the MACE rate compared with early-generation DES, mainly driven by a reduction in the TLR rate. However, nDES implantations for ostial RCA lesions may still be challenging in patients with severe CKD.",

        "Abstract":"OBJECTIVE: To investigate efficacy of remote ischaemic preconditioning on reducing kidney injury and myocardial damage after coronary artery bypass grafting surgery (CABG).\nBACKGROUND: Ischaemic preconditioning of a remote organ reduces ischaemia-reperfusion injury of kidney and myocardium after CABG.\nMETHOD: To reduce myocardial damage and kidney injury by applying Remote Ischaemic Preconditioning we recruited 100 consecutive patients undergoing elective coronary artery bypass grafting surgery. We applied three cycles of lower limb tourniquet, inflated its cuff for 5 minutes in study group or left un-inflated (sham or control group) before the procedure. The primary outcome was serum creatinine, creatinine clearance and troponin-I Levels at time 0, 6, 12, 24 and 48 h. Secondary outcomes were serum C-reactive protein, inotrope score, ventilation time and ICU stay. Data's were analyzed by MedCalc (MedCalc Software bvba, Acacialaan, Belgium). We compared the two group by student t test, chi-square and Mann-Whitney tests.\nRESULTS: The two groups were not statistically different in terms of age, gender, smoking habits, drug use, hypertension, hyperlipidemia and diabetes mellitus. This study showed a higher CRP level in study group comparing with control group (P=0.003), creatinine clearance was slightly higher in study group specially 24 h after procedure but was not statistically significant (p=0.11). Troponin-I level was significantly lower in study group (p=0.001).\nCONCLUSION: This study showed a lower Troponin-I level in study group which suggest a cardio-myocyte protective function of RIPC. It also showed slightly lower Creatinine clearance in control group, gap between two group increases significantly 24 hours after procedure which may suggest a potential kidney protection by RIPC. Serum CRP level was higher in study group. A multi-center randomized controlled trial with a longer time for creatinine clearance measurement may show the potential effectiveness of this non-invasive inexpensive intervention on reducing kidney injury after CABG.",

        "Published":"2016-12-15",
        "Abstract":"INTRODUCTION: Acute kidney injury (AKI) after cardiac surgery is common and results in increased morbidity and mortality. One possible mechanism for AKI is ischaemia-reperfusion injury caused by the extracorporeal circulation (ECC), resulting in an opening of the mitochondrial permeability transition pore (mPTP) in the kidneys, which can lead to cell injury or cell death. Ciclosporin may block the opening of mPTP if administered before the ischaemia-reperfusion injury. We hypothesised that ciclosporin given before the start of ECC in cardiac surgery can decrease the degree of AKI.\nMETHODS AND ANALYSIS: Ciclosporin to Protect Renal function In Cardiac Surgery (CiPRICS) study is an investigator-initiated double-blind, randomised, placebo-controlled, parallel design, single-centre study performed at a tertiary university hospital. The primary objective is to assess the safety and efficacy of ciclosporin to limit the degree of AKI in patients undergoing coronary artery bypass grafting surgery. We aim to evaluate 150 patients with a preoperative estimated glomerular filtration rate of 15-90 mL\/min\/1.73 m. Study patients are randomised in a 1:1 ratio to receive study drug 2.5 mg\/kg ciclosporin or placebo as an intravenous injection after anaesthesia induction but before start of surgery. The primary end point consists of relative P-cystatin C changes from the preoperative day to postoperative day 3. The primary variable will be tested using an analysis of covariance method. Secondary end points include evaluation of P-creatinine and biomarkers of kidney, heart and brain injury.\nETHICS AND DISSEMINATION: The trial is conducted in compliance with the current version of the Declaration of Helsinki and the International Council for Harmonisation (ICH) Good Clinical Practice guidelines E6 (R1) and was approved by the Regional Ethical Review Board, Lund and the Swedish Medical Products Agency (MPA). Written and oral informed consent is obtained before enrolment into the study.\nTRIAL REGISTRATION NUMBER: NCT02397213; Pre-results.",

        "Published":"2016-11-16",
        "Abstract":"Long-term clinical outcomes of new-generation drug-eluting stents in complex anatomic and clinical settings are not well defined. This study assessed the impact of patient and lesion complexity on 2-year outcomes after coronary revascularization with ultrathin strut biodegradable-polymer (BP) sirolimus-eluting stents (SES) versus durable-polymer (DP) everolimus-eluting stents (EES). In a prespecified analysis of the BIOSCIENCE randomized trial (NCT01443104), complex patients (911 of 2,119; 43%) were defined by the presence of acute ST-elevation myocardial infarction (MI); left ventricular ejection fraction ≤30%; renal dysfunction; insulin-treated diabetes; treatment of ostial lesion, bypass graft, unprotected left main lesion; or 3-vessel intervention. The primary end point was target lesion failure (TLF), a composite of cardiac death, target vessel MI, and clinically indicated target lesion revascularization. At 2 years, complex compared with simple patients had a greater risk of TLF (14.5% vs 7.4%, risk ratio 2.05, 95% confidence interval 1.56 to 2.69; p <0.001). The difference was sustained beyond 1 year on landmark analysis. Complex patients had higher rates of the patient-oriented composite end point of death, any MI, or any revascularization (23% vs 14.4%; p <0.001) as well as definite stent thrombosis (1.6% vs 0.4%, p = 0.006). There were no differences in TLF and patient-oriented composite end point between the BP-SES versus DP-EES, consistently among simple and complex patients. In conclusion, patient and lesion complexity had a durable adverse impact on clinical outcomes throughout 2 years of follow-up in this all-comers randomized trial. Safety and efficacy of new-generation BP-SES and DP-EES were comparable, irrespective of complexity status.",

        "Abstract":"BACKGROUND: Low cardiac output syndrome is associated with increased mortality and occurs in 3% to 14% of patients undergoing cardiac surgery on cardiopulmonary bypass (CPB). Levosimendan, a novel calcium sensitizer and K channel activator with inotropic, vasodilatory, and cardioprotective properties, has shown significant promise in reducing the incidence of low cardiac output syndrome and related adverse outcomes in patients undergoing cardiac surgery on CPB.\nMETHODS: LEVO-CTS is a phase 3 randomized, controlled, multicenter study evaluating the efficacy, safety, and cost-effectiveness of levosimendan in reducing morbidity and mortality in high-risk patients with reduced left ventricular ejection fraction (≤35%) undergoing cardiac surgery on CPB. Patients will be randomly assigned to receive either intravenous levosimendan (0.2 μg kg min for the first hour followed by 0.1 μg\/kg for 23hours) or matching placebo initiated within 8hours of surgery. The co-primary end points are (1) the composite of death or renal replacement therapy through day 30 or perioperative myocardial infarction, or mechanical assist device use through day 5 (quad end point tested at α<.01), and (2) the composite of death through postoperative day 30 or mechanical assist device use through day 5 (dual end point tested at α<.04). Safety end points include new atrial fibrillation and death through 90days. In addition, an economic analysis will address the cost-effectiveness of levosimendan compared with placebo in high-risk patients undergoing cardiac surgery on CPB. Approximately 880 patients will be enrolled at approximately 60 sites in the United States and Canada between July 2014 and September 2016, with results anticipated in January 2017.\nCONCLUSION: LEVO-CTS, a large randomized multicenter clinical trial, will evaluate the efficacy, safety, and cost-effectiveness of levosimendan in reducing adverse outcomes in high-risk patients undergoing cardiac surgery on CPB.\nCLINICAL TRIAL REGISTRATION: ClinicalTrials.gov (NCT02025621).",

        "Abstract":"BACKGROUND: Iloprost, a stable prostacyclin analog, is used as a rescue therapy for severe peripheral arterial disease (PAD). It has systemic vasodilatory and anti-aggregant effects, with severe vasodilatation potentially causing organ ischaemia when severe atherosclerosis is the underlying cause. In this study, we retrospectively analysed renal outcomes after iloprost infusion therapy in 86 patients.\nMETHODS: Eighty-six patients with PAD who received iloprost infusion therapy were retrospectively analysed. Clinical and biochemical parameters were recorded before (initial, Cr1), during (third day, Cr2), and after (14th day following the termination of infusion therapy, Cr3) treatment. Acute kidney injury (AKI) was defined according to KDIGO guidelines as a ≥ 0.3 mg\/dl (26.52 µmol\/l) increase in creatinine levels from baseline within 48 hours.\nRESULTS: Cr2 (1.46 ± 0.1 mg\/dl) (129.06 ± 8.84 µmol\/l) and Cr3 (1.53 ± 0.12 mg\/dl) (135.25 ± 10.61 µmol\/l) creatinine levels were significantly higher compared to the initial value (1.15 ± 0.6 mg\/dl) (101.66 ± 53.04 µmol\/l). AKI was observed in 36 patients (41.86%) on the third day of iloprost infusion. Logistic regression analysis revealed smoking and not using acetylsalicylic acid as primary predictors (p = 0.02 and p = 0.008, respectively) of AKI during iloprost treatment. On the third infusion day, patients' urinary output significantly increased (1813.30 ± 1123.46 vs 1545.17 ± 873.00 cm) and diastolic blood pressure significantly decreased (70.07 ± 15.50 vs 74.14 ± 9.42 mmHg) from their initial values.\nCONCLUSION: While iloprost treatment is effective in patients with PAD who are not suitable for surgery, severe systemic vasodilatation can cause renal ischaemia, resulting in nonoliguric AKI. Smoking, no acetylsalicylic acid use, and lower diastolic blood pressure are the clinical risk factors for AKI during iloprost treatment.",

        "Abstract":"INTRODUCTION AND OBJECTIVES: The proportion of elderly patients undergoing primary angioplasty is growing. The present study describes the clinical profile, procedural characteristics, outcomes, and predictors of outcome.\nMETHODS: A 31-center registry of consecutive patients older than 75 years treated with primary angioplasty. Clinical and procedural data were collected, and the patients underwent clinical follow-up.\nRESULTS: The study included 3576 patients (39.3% women, 48.5% with renal failure, 11.5% in Killip III or IV, and 29.8% with>6hours of chest pain). Multivessel disease was present in 55.4% and nonculprit lesions were additionally treated in 24.8%. Radial access was used in 56.4%, bivalirudin in 11.8%, thromboaspiration in 55.9%, and drug-eluting stents in 26.6%. The 1-month and 2-year incidences of cardiovascular death were 10.1% and 14.7%, respectively. The 2-year rates of definite or probable thrombosis, repeat revascularization, and BARC bleeding>2 were 3.1%, 2.3%, and 4.2%, respectively. Predictive factors were diabetes mellitus, renal failure, atrial fibrillation, delay to reperfusion>6hours, ejection fraction<45%, Killip class III-IV, radial access, bivalirudin, drug-eluting stents, final TIMI flow of III, and incomplete revascularization at discharge.\nCONCLUSIONS: Notable registry findings include frequently delayed presentation and a high prevalence of adverse factors such as renal failure and multivessel disease. Positive procedure-related predictors include shorter delay, use of radial access, bivalirudin, drug-eluting stents, and complete revascularization before discharge.",

        "Abstract":"Despite the application of new antiplatelet drugs (prasugrel and ticagrelor), dual antiplatelet therapy with clopidogrel and aspirin remains the standard for patients with acute coronary syndrome undergoing percutaneous coronary intervention, especially in countries of low socioeconomic status. Regardless of the proven benefits, numerous studies have shown that certain groups of patients who receive standard doses of clopidogrel and aspirin do not respond adequately, and many of them also exhibit adverse cardiovascular events. Studies have shown that the risk of stent thrombosis and ischemic complications is higher in patients with: acute coronary syndrome, diabetes mellitus, thrombocytosis, reduced systolic function of the left ventricle with ejection fraction less than 30%, presence of multiple stents, longer and thinner stents, and renal failure. In these patients it is particularly important to assess the response to clopidogrel and selecting adequate antiplatelet therapy; this provides an impetus for platelet function tests. The second especially significant group to target for laboratory evaluation includes patients with increased risk of bleeding, such as elderly patients, patients with low body weight, anemia, thrombocytopenia, renal failure, past or current ventricular or duodenal ulcer, coagulopathy, or liver disease. The third important application of platelet function tests entails the preparation and evaluation of the time for surgical interventions or invasive diagnostic procedures in patients on antiplatelet therapy. These tests can also be helpful for monitoring the effects of therapy of bleeding due to platelet dysfunction. For high-risk patients the careful selection of optimal antiplatelet drug(s) on the basis of estimated individual risk of thrombosis and bleeding, pharmacodynamic characteristics of each drug, and patient̀s comorbidity remains essential.",

Based on the occurrence of AKI diagnosed according to the 2012 KDIGO AKI criteria, they were divided into AKI group and non-AKI group and further into conservative treatment groups, coronary angiography (CAG) groups, and coronary artery bypass grafting (CABG) groups based on the timing of AKI occurrence, respectively. Related risk factors of AKI were analyzed by univariate and multivariate logistic regressions.\nRESULTS: 410 (29.9%) developed AKI. Patients with AKI had significantly increased in-hospital mortality than patients without AKI. Multivariate logistic regression analysis showed that decreased baseline eGFR, increased fasting plasma glucose (FPG), use of diuretics and Killip grade IV were independent risk factors of AKI, while increased DBP on admission was a protective factor for patients in conservative treatment group. Decreased baseline eGFR, increased FPG, use of diuretics, intraoperative hypotension and acute infection were independent risk factors of AKI for patients in the CAG group. Decreased baseline eGFR, increased FPG, use of diuretics and low cardiac output syndrome after operation were independent risk factors of AKI for patients in the CABG group.\nCONCLUSIONS: AKI is a common complication and associated with increased mortality after AMI.

        "Published":"2016-07-11",
        "Abstract":"AIM: We previously reported a novel triptolide (TP)-glucosamine conjugate (TPG) that specifically accumulated in kidneys and protected renal function from acute ischemia\/reperfusion (I\/R) injury in rats. In this study we further examined the molecular mechanisms underlying the renoprotective action of TPG.\nMETHODS: The renal-targeting of TPG was investigated in a human proximal renal tubular epithelial cell line (HK-2) by measuring cell uptake of TP or TPG. The effects of TP or TPG on cell cycle distribution and apoptosis rate of HK-2 cells were assessed, and the activities of caspase-3 and caspase-9 were also measured. SD rats were subjected to bilateral renal ischemia by temporarily clamping both renal pedicles. The rats were administered TP (4.17 μmol·kg·d, iv) or TPG (4.17 μmol·kg·d, iv) for 3 d before the renal surgery. The kidneys were harvested after 24 h of recovery from the surgery. The levels of oxidative stress, proinflammatory cytokines, chemotactic cytokines and intracellular adhesion molecules in kidneys were examined.\nRESULTS: The uptake of TPG in HK-2 cells was 2-3 times higher than that of TP at the concentrations tested. Furthermore, TPG targeting the proximal tubules was mediated through interactions with megalin receptors. TP (40-160 nmol\/L) concentration-dependently increased G\/M arrest, apoptosis and caspase-3\/caspase-9 activity in HK-2 cells, whereas the same concentrations of TPG did not show those features when compared with the control group. In I\/R-treated rats, TPG administration caused more robust down-regulation of proinflammatory cytokines (TNF-α, IL-6, IL-1, TGF-β) and chemotactic cytokines (MCP-1) in the kidneys compared with TP administration, suggesting the inhibition of the proliferation and accumulation of lymphocytes. And TPG administration also caused more prominent inhibition on the levels of oxidative stress and intracellular adhesion molecules in the kidneys, compared with TP administration.\nCONCLUSION: The renal-targeting TPG is more effective and less toxic than TP, in amelioration of I\/R-induced rat renal injury, which may provide a new avenue for the treatment of acute kidney injury.",

        "Published":"2016-07-15",
        "Abstract":"OBJECTIVE: To evaluate the incidence of contrast-induced nephropathy (CIN) following coronary angiography and percutaneous coronary intervention (PCI) utilizing a novel ultra-low contrast delivery (ULCD) technique.\nBACKGROUND: Current techniques for reducing contrast volumes during angiographic and PCI procedures require the use of advanced coronary imaging methods, such as intravascular ultrasound and coronary flow wires. We propose the use of an automated contrast injector system (ACIS) with a novel programming technique that significantly reduces contrast volumes and CIN development.\nMETHODS: From 2013 to 2014, a total of 123 patients with stage III or higher chronic kidney disease (CKD) underwent coronary angiography, PCI, or a combined procedure using the ULCD technique. A retrospective analysis was conducted to evaluate contrast volumes and rate of CIN development. Patients developing CIN were compared using tests of proportions.\nRESULTS: The median contrast volume was 17.9 mL (n = 123). The study cohorts comprised diagnostic (15.2 mL; n = 72), PCI (17.1 mL; n = 30), and PCI + diagnostic groups (27.9 mL; n = 21). The incidence of CIN observed in the entire cohort through day 7 was 3.3% (4\/123). Seventy-five percent of the CIN cases occurred following diagnostic angiography alone. Longitudinal follow-up at 21 days identified an additional 5 cases of CIN. Compared to literature data, the ULCD technique delivers less contrast per case.\nCONCLUSION: The adaptation of the ULCD technique for coronary procedures significantly reduces contrast volume delivery when compared with conventional practice or previously described low-contrast techniques. The ULCD appears to be an efficacious method of limiting CIN development in a susceptible population with CKD.",

        "Abstract":"INTRODUCTION: Arteriovenous fistula (AVF) creation in children could be extremely challenging for vascular surgeons due to small vessels with a high tendency of vasospasm. This could be one reason for primary failures (PF) and early access thrombosis. There exists no guideline for the need of intraoperative heparin administration during hemodialysis fistula creation. The aim of this study was to evaluate the effect of intra-operative heparin administration on immediate outcome.\nMETHODS: Medical records of 42 pediatric patients aged between 7 and 17 years were retrospectively reviewed. All received an AVF under inpatient conditions by exclusively one vascular surgeon with many years of professional experience. The intraoperative anticoagulation standards changed by the years 2001 based on the decision of the vascular surgeon. Therefore, we build two groups (group 1: 14 patients with 5000 IU of intravenous heparin during surgery and group 2: 28 patients without heparin). Major complications included hematoma or bleeding leading to surgery. PF was defined as the inability to use the AVF even once due to absent maturation or occlusion within 4 weeks after creation.\nRESULTS: We found 6 (14%) PF with the need of immediate surgical access revision (three from group 1 and three from group 2; p = 0.350). There were no bleedings leading to surgery in all cases, but 5 (12%) hematomas without the need of surgical revision (three from group 1 and two from group 2; p = 0.736).\nCONCLUSIONS: We found no benefit of heparin administration during clamping the arteries while performing the arteriovenous fistula in pediatric patients.",

Adoption of Anti-Xa protocols could reduce transfusions among cardiovascular patients in the US.\nSUMMARY: Background Anticoagulant activated factor X protein (Anti-Xa) has been shown to be a more precise monitoring tool than activated partial thromboplastin time (aPTT) for patients receiving unfractionated heparin (UFH) anticoagulation therapy. Objectives To compare red blood cell (RBC) transfusions between patients receiving UFH who are monitored with Anti-Xa and those monitored with aPTT. Patients\/Methods A retrospective cohort study was conducted on patients diagnosed with acute coronary syndrome (ACS) (N = 14 822), diagnosed with ischemic stroke (STK) (N = 1568) or with a principal diagnosis of venous thromboembolism (VTE) (N = 4414) in the MedAssets data from January 2009 to December 2013. Anti-Xa and aPTT groups were identified from hospital billing details, with both brand and generic name as search criteria. Propensity score techniques were used to match Anti-Xa cases to aPTT controls. RBC transfusions were identified from hospital billing data. Multivariable logistic regression was used to identify significant drivers of transfusions. Results Anti-Xa patients had fewer RBC transfusions than aPTT patients in the ACS population (difference 17.5%; 95% confidence interval [CI] 16.4-18.7%), the STK population (difference 8.2%; 95% CI 4.4-11.9%), and the VTE population (difference 4.7%; 95% CI 3.3-6.1%). After controlling for patient age and gender, diagnostic risks (e.g. anemia, renal insufficiency, and trauma), and invasive procedures (e.g. cardiac catheterization, hemodialysis, and coronary artery bypass graft), Anti-Xa patients were less likely to have a transfusion while hospitalized for ACS (odds ratio [OR] 0.16, 95% CI 0.14-0.18), STK (OR 0.41, 95% CI 0.29-0.57), and VTE (OR 0.35, 95% CI 0.26-0.48). Conclusion Anti-Xa monitoring was associated with a significant reduction in RBC transfusions as compared with aPTT monitoring alone.",

        "Abstract":"BACKGROUND AND OBJECTIVES: Recent single-institutional series have examined the relationship of body mass index (BMI) in patients undergoing cytoreductive surgery (CRS) and intraperitoneal chemotherapy (IPC) generally without significant increase in serious complications with increasing BMI. This study evaluates the impact of BMI on complication rates using a national cohort.\nMETHODS: The ACS NSQIP database was queried for patients undergoing concurrent CRS with IPC (2005-2012). Death and serious morbidity (DSM) was the primary outcome. Statistical analyses were performed to determine significant associations between peri-operative factors and DSM.\nRESULTS: Of 1,085 patients, there were 30.4% (n = 330) obese (BMI >30) and 32.1% (n = 348) normal weight (BMI 18.5-24.9) patients. DSM rates did not differ between these groups (P = 0.853). Obese patients were more likely to experience post-operative wound (P = 0.017) and renal (P = 0.002) complications. Hypoalbuminemia (OR 7.34; 95% CI 2.27-23.73), prolonged operative time (OR 3.02; 95% CI 1.83-4.97) and concomitant liver resection (OR 3.29; 95% CI 1.31-8.28) were independent risk factors for DSM among obese patients.\nCONCLUSIONS: Obesity is not significantly associated with DSM in patients undergoing CRS\/IPC, and should not be a major deterrence for surgery. However, obese patients are more likely to experience wound and renal complications and hypoalbuminemia is a strong preoperative risk factor. J. Surg.

        "Abstract":"BACKGROUND: The influence of age upon the use of drug-eluting stents (DES) in patients aged ≥ 65 years is uncertain. The aim of this study is to investigate the impact of age increase in patients aged ≥ 65 years in the use of DES in patients undergoing percutaneous coronary intervention (PCI).\nMETHOD: The study cohort comprised 8,598 patients ≥ 65 years of age who underwent stent implantation from April 2003 to March 2014. We defined the first DES era as the period April 2003 to July 2008 and the second DES era as the period July 2008 to March 2014. Multivariable logistic regression was performed for both eras to assess the impact of age increase and analyze independent factors associated with DES implantation.\nRESULTS: In the first DES era cohort, the two groups of patients differed in their risk factor profile with lower rates of male sex, diabetes, smokers, and hypercholesterolemia in those aged ≥ 75 years. There were more Caucasian and less African-Americans in this age group. Furthermore, patients aged ≥ 75 years had lower left ventricular ejection fraction (LVEF) and baseline haematocrit concentration were more likely to present with an acute myocardial infarction (MI) than stable or unstable angina and had higher rates of a previous history for congestive heart failure (CHF), chronic renal insufficiency (CRI), and peripheral vascular disease (PVD). These differences were broadly similar for patients in the second DES era except for similarities in LVEF, presentation with unstable angina, and PVD, as well as a lower rate for previous PCI. DES use was reduced with increasing age in both the first (OR=0.78; 95% CI=0.69-0.89) and second DES era (OR=0.53; 95% CI=0.47-0.58). In both eras, DES use was less likely in current smokers, patients presenting with acute MI and cardiogenic shock, and those with a previous history of CHF.\nCONCLUSION: In patients aged ≥ 65 years, the use of DES decreased with increasing age. This observation was apparent in both the first and second DES era. © 2015 Wiley Periodicals, Inc.",

        "Abstract":"OBJECTIVE: To describe the experience and technique of zero-ischemia laparoscopic-assisted partial nephrectomy at The Hospital for Sick Children, as an alternative to the traditional open approach for nephron-sparing surgery (NSS) in selected children with Wilms tumor (WT).\nMATERIALS AND METHODS: Patients with diagnosis of WT treated with neoadjuvant chemotherapy and who underwent laparoscopic-assisted NSS at the Hospital for Sick Children from 2012 to 2016 were identified and their charts were reviewed retrospectively. Patients underwent laparoscopic exploration, lymph node sampling, kidney mobilization, vascular control, and adrenal sparing. This was followed by open NSS through a small flank incision; no clamping of the hilum or major renal branches was performed.\nRESULTS: Six patients were identified; all patients underwent successful resection. One patient required radical nephrectomy due to inability to safely define negative margins. Tumors ranged in size from 0.9 to 5.6 cm in diameter. Mean operating time was 293 ± 50.2 minutes, with an average duration of pneumoperitoneum of 216 ± 27 minutes. Intraoperative blood loss was negligible. No tumor spillages occurred. Postoperative pathology revealed negative margins in all resected specimens. One case of urine leak occurred postoperatively, which resolved spontaneously. Renal function was preserved in all children. At a mean follow up of 11.5 months, all patients have been recurrence free.\nCONCLUSION: The herein presented strategy allows for safe nephron-sparing resection of selected WT with acceptable morbidity, good short-term disease-free survival, and potentially better cosmesis and recovery than traditional open surgery. This preliminary experience suggests that minimally invasive options for NSS in children merit further evaluation.",

Study population was categorized according to the presence of moderate or severe versus mild or no target lesion CAC, assessed through coronary angiography. Co-primary endpoints of interest were the composite of death, myocardial infarction (MI), or target lesion revascularization and death, MI, or stent thrombosis at 3-year follow-up.\nRESULTS: Among 11,557 women included in the pooled dataset, CAC status was available in 6,371 women.

        "Abstract":"The administration of antiplatelet drugs for months after a drug-eluting stent implantation is critical in decreasing the risk of complications, and premature discontinuation of antiplatelet therapy before the recommended period is the most important predictor for late complications. Therefore, we investigated the prevalence and associated factors of premature discontinuation of antiplatelet therapy in patients in Korea. This retrospective cohort study was conducted using the Korean National Health Insurance Service-National Sample Cohort data. Patients who were treated with dual-antiplatelet therapy (DAPT) were identified with medication prescription data. The Kaplan-Meier failure time plot was used to illustrate the cumulative probability of treatment discontinuation. Cox regression analysis was conducted to compare predictors of early discontinuation of DAPT. The characteristics of the early discontinuation group were not significantly different from the guideline concordance group, except for a higher prevalence of disability and a lower rate of chronic kidney disease. In a Cox regression model, the presence of hypertension was identified as a negative predictor of early discontinuation, and disability was not a statistically significant predictor. The prevalence of early discontinuation was 31.0% and seems to be significantly higher than those reported from prospective studies, which may more accurately reflect the real-world situation. In conclusion, physicians should make more effort to educate patients on the risk associated with premature discontinuation of antiplatelet therapy after percutaneous coronary intervention with drug-eluting stent, and further studies investigating the reasons for nonadherence of DAPT are needed to improve DAPT compliance.",

At follow-up of 1 year, net adverse clinical event (NACE) was defined as cardiac death, myocardial infarction, target vessel revascularization, definite\/probable stent thrombosis, or thrombolysis in myocardial infarction major bleeding.\nRESULTS: Short-term DAPT as compared with prolonged DAPT was not associated with 1-year NACEs after DES implantation [hazard ratio (HR) 1.068, 95 % confidence interval (CI) 0.787-1.450, p = 0.671].

The lack of any large randomized trials specifically in RI patients, and the absence of the uniformed clinical data reporting policy, clouds the reality. Moreover, triaging RI patients is problematic due to ongoing kidney deterioration, and the fact that RI patients are prone to both vascular occlusions and bleeding.\nMETHODS AND RESULTS: Seven hundred and one Korean patients receiving DAPT with aspirin 100 mg\/daily and clopidogrel 75 mg\/daily after PCI were prospectively enrolled in the study. Patients were dichotomized into five groups according to RI: estimated glomerular filtration rate (eGFR) >90 mL\/min\/1.73 m(2) (RI1), 60-89 mL\/min\/1.73 m(2) (RI2), 30-59 mL\/min\/1.73 m(2) (RI3), <30 mL\/min\/1.73 m(2) (RI4), and undergoing dialysis (RI5). Major adverse clinical events (MACEs; cardiovascular death, myocardial infarction, stent thrombosis, and stroke) were collected for 1 year. Platelet reactivity by VerifyNow™ assay and eGFR were simultaneously assessed at 1 month after maintenance DAPT. Patients with RI exhibited a gradual significant increase of residual platelet reactivity during DAPT, dependent on eGFR deterioration [191 ± 72 PRU (RI1) vs. 216 ± 78 PRU (RI2) vs. 248 ± 80 PRU (RI3) vs. 264 ± 70 PRU (RI4) vs. 317 ± 96 PRU (RI5), P < 0.001] being the highest in the dialyses group. Declined eGFR has been gradually associated with advancing age (OR = 1.03, 95% CI = 1.00-1.05; P = 0.032), female gender (OR = 1.7, 95% CI = 1.1-2.5; P = 0.01), diminished smoking rates (OR = 0.6, 95% CI = 0.37-1.00; P = 0.05), hypertension (OR = 1.8, 95% CI = 1.3-2.5; P < 0.001); diabetes (OR = 1.5, 95% CI = 1.1-2.1; P = 0.007), and MACE (HR = 13.9; 95% CI = 1.6-124.3; P = 0.02 for RI4; and HR = 31.9; 95% CI = 2.9-351.9; P = 0.005 for dialysis), but not for bleeding (P = 0.143). Major adverse clinical event risks still remained significant for RI4 (P = 0.027) and RI5 (P = 0.002) by multivariate Cox hazard regression estimates.\nCONCLUSION: Renal impairment is associated with gradual elevation of residual platelet reactivity while on DAPT, enhancing MACE risks, but not bleeding events. These data should be confirmed in a large randomized outcome-driven trial, and may justify future maintenance-phase DAPT regimen\/dose adjustment in RI patients.",

We used propensity score matching and inverse probability of treatment weighting to create DES- and BMS-treated groups whose observed baseline characteristics were well-balanced. The associations between stent type and the outcomes of (1) death; (2) death or myocardial infarction (MI); (3) death, MI, or repeat revascularization (RR); and (4) hospitalized bleeding were compared using Cox proportional hazards regression.\nRESULTS: Drug-eluting stent use increased during the study period, mirroring the trend described in the general population. In the propensity score-matched cohort, no significant association among DES (vs BMS) use and outcomes was observed at 1 and 2 years of follow-up. However, at 3 years, DES was associated with 20% (95% confidence interval [CI], 4-33%) lower risk of death, 15% (95% CI, 1-27%) lower risk of death or MI, and 14% (95% CI, 2-24%) lower risk of death, MI, or repeat revascularization.

Previous PCI (HR, 2.05, 95% CI 1.68 to 2.50), moderate-to-severe renal disease (HR, 1.89, 95% CI 1.30 to 2.74) and peripheral vascular disease (HR, 1.86, 95% CI 1.38 to 2.52) were the three most powerful independent predictors of the combined endpoint at 5 years.\nCONCLUSIONS: The final 5-year follow-up of the Nobori 2 registry demonstrates the safety and effectiveness of the BP-BES in an unselected, broadly inclusive cohort of PCI patients, highlighting the excellent performance of this coronary stent technology after polymer biodegradation.\nTRIAL REGISTRATION NUMBER: ISRCTN81649913; Results.",

        "Abstract":"BACKGROUND: Patients with a left ventricular ejection fraction (LVEF) of less than 40 % are at high risk of developing postoperative low cardiac output syndrome (LCOS). Despite actual treatments (inotropic agents and\/or mechanical assist devices), the mortality rate of such patients remains very high (13 to 24 %). The LICORN trial aims at assessing the efficacy of a preoperative infusion of levosimendan in reducing postoperative LCOS in patients with poor LVEF undergoing coronary artery bypass grafting (CABG).\nMETHODS\/DESIGN: LICORN study is a multicenter, randomized double-blind, placebo-controlled trial in parallel groups. 340 patients with LVEF ≤40 %, undergoing CABG will be recruited from 13 French hospitals. The study drug will be started after anaesthesia induction and infused over 24 h (0.1 μg\/kg\/min). The primary outcome (postoperative LCOS) is evaluated using a composite criterion composed of: 1) need for inotropic agents beyond 24 h following discontinuation of the study drug; 2) need for post-operative mechanical assist devices or failure to wean from these techniques when inserted pre-operatively; 3) need for renal replacement therapy. Secondary outcomes include: 1) mortality at Day 28 and Day 180; 2) each item of the composite criterion of the primary outcome; 3) the number of \"ventilator-free\" days and \"out of intensive care unit\" days at Day 28.\nDISCUSSION: The usefulness of levosimendan in the perioperative period has not yet been documented with a high level of evidence. The LICORN study is the first randomized controlled trial evaluating the clinical value of preoperative levosimendan in high risk cardiac surgical patients undergoing CABG.\nTRIAL REGISTRATION NUMBER: NCT02184819 (ClinicalTrials.gov).",

        "Abstract":"OBJECTIVE: The goal of this retrospective study was to investigate the effects of perioperative use of dexmedetomidine (Dex) on outcomes for older patients undergoing cardiac surgery.\nDESIGN: Retrospective investigation.\nSETTING: Patients from a single tertiary medical center.\nPARTICIPANTS: A total of 505 patients (≥65 years old) who underwent coronary artery bypass graft (CABG) or valve surgery. CABG and\/or valve surgery plus other procedures were divided into 2 groups: 283 received intravenous Dex infusion (Dex group) and 222 did not (Non-Dex group).\nINTERVENTIONS: Perioperative Dex intravenous infusion (0.24 to 0.6 μg\/kg\/h) initiated after cardiopulmonary bypass and continued for<24 hours postoperatively in the ICU.\nMEASUREMENTS AND MAIN RESULTS: Data were risk adjusted, propensity score weighted, and multivariate logistic regression was used. The primary outcome was mortality. Secondary outcomes included postoperative stroke, coma, myocardial infarction, heart block, cardiac arrest, delirium, renal failure, and sepsis. Perioperative Dex infusion significantly decreased in-hospital mortality (0.90% v 2.83%; adjusted odds ratio (OR), 0.099; 95% confidence interval (CI), 0.030-0.324; p = 0.004) and operative mortality (1.35% v 3.18%; adjusted OR, 0.251; 95% CI, 0.077-0.813; p = 0.021). Perioperative Dex treatment also reduced the risk of stroke (0.90% v 1.77%; adjusted OR, 0.15; 95% CI, 0.038-0.590; p = 0.007), and delirium (7.21% v 10.95%; adjusted OR, 0.35; 95% CI, 0.212-0.578; p < 0.0001).\nCONCLUSIONS: Results from this study (ClinicalTrials.gov identifier: NCT01683448) suggested perioperative use of dexmedetomidine was associated with decreases in in-hospital and operative mortality in elderly patients following cardiac surgery. It also reduced incidences of postoperative stroke and delirium in elderly patients.",

        "Abstract":"BACKGROUND: Comorbid elderly patients with non-ST-elevation myocardial infarction (non-STEMI) are underrepresented in randomized trials and undergo fewer cardiac catheterizations according to registries. Our aim was to compare the conservative and invasive strategies in these patients.\nMETHODS: Randomized multicenter study, including 106 patients (January 2012-March 2014) with non-STEMI, over 70years and with comorbidities defined by at least two of the following: peripheral artery disease, cerebral vascular disease, dementia, chronic pulmonary disease, chronic renal failure or anemia. Patients were randomized to invasive (routine coronary angiogram, n=52) or conservative (coronary angiogram only if recurrent ischemia or heart failure, n=54) strategy. Medical treatment was identical. The main endpoint was the composite of all-cause mortality, reinfarction and readmission for cardiac cause (postdischarge revascularization or heart failure), at long-term (2.5-year follow-up). Analysis of cumulative event rate (incidence rate ratio=IRR) and time to first event (hazard ratio=HR), were performed.\nRESULTS: Cardiac catheterization\/revascularization rates were 100%\/58% in the invasive versus 20%\/9% in the conservative arm. There were no differences between groups in the main endpoint (invasive vs conservative: IRR=0.946, 95% CI 0.466-1.918, p=0.877) at long-term. The invasive strategy, however, tended to improve 3-month outcomes in terms of mortality (HR=0.348, 95% CI 0.122-0.991, p=0.048), and of mortality or ischemic events (reinfarction or postdischarge revascularization) (HR=0.432, 95% CI 0.190-0.984, p=0.046). This benefit declined during follow-up.\nCONCLUSIONS: Invasive management did not modify long-term outcome in comorbid elderly patients with non-STEMI. The finding of a tendency towards an improvement in the short-term needs confirmation in larger studies (clinicaltrials.govNCT1645943).",

        "Abstract":"BACKGROUND: Induction therapy in deceased donor kidney transplantation is costly, with wide discrepancy in utilization and a limited evidence base, particularly regarding cost-effectiveness.\nMETHODS: We linked the United States Renal Data System data set to Medicare claims to estimate cumulative costs, graft survival, and incremental cost-effectiveness ratio (ICER - cost per additional year of graft survival) within 3 years of transplantation in 19 450 deceased donor kidney transplantation recipients with Medicare as primary payer from 2000 to 2008. We divided the study cohort into high-risk (age > 60 years, panel-reactive antibody > 20%, African American race, Kidney Donor Profile Index > 50%, cold ischemia time > 24 hours) and low-risk (not having any risk factors, comprising approximately 15% of the cohort). After the elimination of dominated options, we estimated expected ICER among induction categories: no-induction, alemtuzumab, rabbit antithymocyte globulin (r-ATG), and interleukin-2 receptor-antagonist.\nRESULTS: No-induction was the least effective and most costly option in both risk groups. Depletional antibodies (r-ATG and alemtuzumab) were more cost-effective across all willingness-to-pay thresholds in the low-risk group. For the high-risk group and its subcategories, the ICER was very sensitive to the graft survival; overall both depletional antibodies were more cost-effective, mainly for higher willingness to pay threshold (US $100 000 and US $150 000). Rabbit ATG appears to achieve excellent cost-effectiveness acceptability curves (80% of the recipients) in both risk groups at US $50 000 threshold (except age > 60 years). In addition, only r-ATG was associated with graft survival benefit over no-induction category (hazard ratio, 0.91; 95% confidence interval, 0.84-0.99) in a multivariable Cox regression analysis.\nCONCLUSIONS: Antibody-based induction appears to offer substantial advantages in both cost and outcome compared with no-induction. Overall, depletional induction (preferably r-ATG) appears to offer the greatest benefits.",

        "Abstract":"Objectives Pseudoaneurysms are a well-recognized complication of percutaneous angiographic procedures. Ultrasound-guided thrombin injection is currently the preferred treatment modality. This study was undertaken to evaluate our experience with the management of post-procedure pseudoaneurysms. Methods A retrospective study was undertaken of all patients who developed a post-procedure pseudoaneurysm between March 2004 and January 2013. Data were obtained from our prospectively maintained non-invasive vascular laboratory data base. Results Overall, 167 patients (80 men) with post-procedure pseudoaneurysms were identified. The mean age was 66 years. Post-procedure pseudoaneurysms developed following diagnostic coronary angiography (38%), coronary angioplasty (37%), peripheral vascular interventions (14.7%), or other access procedures (7.6%). Mean post-procedure pseudoaneurysm diameter was 2.8 ± 1.8 cm. One hundred forty-two post-procedure pseudoaneurysms were injected with thrombin under ultrasound guidance. Primary success rate was 93.5%. There were 12 (8.5%) procedural failures of which seven (58%) responded to reinjection, three (25%) required operative management, one was treated with ultrasound-guided compression, and one (8.3%) was simply observed. On multivariate analysis, failures were associated with increased aneurysm diameter ( p = 0.006; odds ratio 2.23, 95% CI 1.25 to 3.96), end-stage renal disease ( p = 0.013; odds ratio 1.15, 95% CI 1.09 to 1.78) and superficial femoral artery aneurysm origin ( p = 0.031; odds ratio 0.20, 95% CI 0.04 to 0.86). There were two episodes of thrombus formation in the femoral artery; one resolved with anticoagulation alone, and the other required thrombectomy. Conclusions Percutaneous ultrasound-guided thrombin injection is an effective and safe method for managing post-procedure pseudoaneurysms. Failure rates are low and associated with large aneurysm size, superficial femoral artery origin and end-stage renal disease.",

        "Abstract":"INTRODUCTION: Prolonged dual anti-platelet therapy (DAPT) may cause excess bleeding in certain patients. The biolimus-A9 drug-coated stent (BA9-DCS) has a rapid drug-elution profile allowing shortened DAPT. Data were gathered on the early experience implanting this stent in drug-eluting stent eligible patients deemed to be at high risk of bleeding.\nBACKGROUND AND METHODS: The demographics, procedural data and clinical outcomes were gathered prospectively for 249 patients treated with a BA9-DCS stent at 2 UK centres, and compared to a cohort of patients treated in the same period with drug-eluting stents (PCI-DES).\nRESULTS: Operator-defined BA9-DCS indications included warfarin therapy, age, and anaemia. Patients receiving a BA9-DCS were older (71.6±11.8 vs. 64.8±11.6yrs, p<0.001), more often female (38.2 vs. 26.8%, P<0.001), and more likely to have comorbidity including chronic kidney disease or poor LV function than PCI-DES patients. The baseline Mehran bleed risk score was also significantly higher in the BA9-DCS group (19.4±8.7 vs. 13.1±5.8, p<0.001). Of the BA9-DCS cohort, 95.5% of patients demonstrated disease fitting NICE criteria for DES placement. The number of lesions treated (1.81±1.1 vs. 1.58±0.92, p = 0.003), total lesion length (32.1±21.7 vs. 26.1±17.6mm, p<0.001), number of stents used (1.93±1.11 vs. 1.65±1.4, p = 0.007) and total stent length (37.5±20.8 vs. 32.4±20.3, p<0.01) were greater for BA9-DCS patients. DAPT was prescribed for 3.3±3.9 months for BA9-DCS patients and 11.3±2.4 months for PCI-DES patients (p<0.001). At follow up of 392±124 days despite the abbreviated DAPT course stent related event were infrequent with ischemia-driven restenosis PCI (2.8 vs. 3.4%, p = 0.838), and stent thrombosis (1.6 vs. 2.1%, p = 0.265) rates similar between the BA9-DCS ad PCI-DES groups. After propensity scoring all clinical end-points were similar between both cohorts.\nCONCLUSIONS: This early experience using polymer-free BA9 drug-coated stents in drug-eluting stent type patients at risk of bleeding are encouraging. Further studies are warranted.",

Between November 2012 and February 2015, 2,062 consecutive patients with VTE from 11 acute care hospitals in Switzerland were enrolled in the SWIss Venous ThromboEmbolism Registry (SWIVTER). Overall, 417 (20 %) patients were treated with rivaroxaban. In comparison to 1,645 patients on conventional anticoagulation, patients on rivaroxaban were younger (56 ± 18 vs. 65 ± 17 years; p<0.001), less often had pulmonary embolism (38 % vs 66 %; p<0.001), hypertension (26 % vs 41 %; p<0.001), cancer (10 % vs 28 %; p<0.001), congestive heart failure (10 % vs 17 %; p=0.001), diabetes (8 % vs 15 %; p<0.001), chronic lung disease (7 % vs 13 %; p=0.001), renal insufficiency (7 % vs 13 %; p=0.001), recent surgery (7 % vs 14 %; p<0.001), and acute coronary syndrome (1 % vs 4 %; p=0.009). VTE reperfusion therapy was more frequently used (28 % vs 9 %; p<0.001) and indefinite-duration anticoagulation treatment less often planned (26 % vs 39 %; p<0.001), respectively. In the propensity score-adjusted population, the risk of recurrent VTE was similar in patients on rivaroxaban vs conventional anticoagulation (1.2 % vs 2.1 %, hazard ratio [HR] 0.55, 95 % confidence interval [CI] 0.18-1.65; p=0.29); the risk of major bleeding was also similar, respectively (0.5 % vs 0.5 %, HR 1.00, 95 %CI 0.14-7.07; p=1.00). Conventional anticoagulation is still frequently used for the treatment of VTE, particularly in the elderly and those with comorbidities. Early clinical outcomes were comparable between propensity score-adjusted patient populations on rivaroxaban and conventional anticoagulation.",

        "Abstract":"BACKGROUND: Proton pump inhibitors (PPIs) are among the commonest drugs used nowadays. The aim of our study was to analyze prolonged utilization of proton pump inhibitors in medical therapy of patients with ischemic and valvular heart disease. Secondly, profile of utilization was scrutinized to patient characteristics and type of cardiovascular treatments.\nMETHODS: The study included consecutive patients scheduled for cardiovascular rehabilitation 2-6months after index cardiovascular treatment.\nRESULTS: Two hundred ninety-four patients (n=294\/604; 48.7%) have been using proton pump inhibitor in their therapy after index cardiovascular treatment. Cardiovascular treatments were powerfully connected with utilization of PPIs; surgery 5.77 (95%-confidence intervals [CI]: 4.05-8.22; p<0.001) and PCI 0.15 (CI: 0.10-0.22; p<0.001). The odds for having proton pump inhibitor in their chronic therapy were increased for atrial fibrillation 1.87 (CI: 1.08-3.23; p=0.025) and decreased for obesity 0.65 (CI: 0.45-0.96; p=0.035); surviving myocardial infarction 0.49 (CI: 0.29-0.83; p=0.035). Multinomial logistic regression controlled for existence of chronic renal disease found no significant association of renal dysfunction and PPI therapy. The existence of anemia was significantly increased in patients taking PPIs than controls; 6.00 (CI: 3.85-9.33; p<0.001). The use of PPI was also associated with worsening of metabolic profile, in part due to decreased utilization of ACE-inhibitors and statins. PPI consumption correlated with age of patients (Rho=0.216; p<0.001).\nCONCLUSIONS: High proportion of cardiovascular, particularly surgical patients with ischemic and valvular heart disease utilized proton pump inhibitor in prolonged courses. Prolonged courses of PPIs were connected with existence and worsening of red blood count indexes, older age, lesser weight of patients and underutilization of cardioprotective drugs.",

We retrospectively compared clinical parameters and outcomes between different endogenous creatinine clearance rates [estimated glomerular filtration rates (eGFRs), ml\/min×1.73 m].\nRESULTS: The incidences of major adverse cardiocerebral events, all-cause death, cardiac death, and stroke were not significantly different between the DES and the CABG groups. The DES group had significantly higher risks of myocardial infarction (MI) and target vessel revascularization than the CABG group. Compared with the CABG group, the hazard ratios for target vessel revascularization were 3.965 [95% confidence interval (CI): 1.743-9.023, P=0.001] in the eGFR of at least 60 group and 46.463 (95% CI: 4.558-473.639, P=0.001) in the eGFR 45-59 group.

        "Abstract":"BACKGROUND: Management of dialysis patients with critical limb ischemia (CLI) still represents a challenge to vascular medicine, whereas the effects of the pedal arch quality in these patients with predominant affection of the infrapopliteal vessels have rarely been evaluated. Therefore, our aim was to analyze the outcomes of infrapopliteal angioplasty in the setting of chronic renal failure (end-stage renal disease) and evaluate the influence of the pedal arch involvement on clinical success.\nMETHODS: Prospective follow-up of 32 ERSD patients on hemodialysis (mean age, 72 years) with CLI and consecutive infrapopliteal angioplasty over a 5-year period 2010-2014 was performed. Mean follow-up was 10 months (range, 0-51 months). Statistical end points were defined for amputation-free survival, overall survival, and wound healing. Each patient's pedal arch was classified in 4 categories according to patency on completion angiography and the influence of the pedal arch quality on end points was assessed.\nRESULTS: A total of 44 vessels in 32 ischemic legs were treated. Technical success was achieved in 96% of patients, no major complications were observed. A 30-day mortality rate amounted 6% with no procedure-related deaths. The 1-year amputation-free survival rate was 56% and 34% at 2 years. Two major amputations were required. Subsequent revascularization procedures were necessary in 11 patients (10 redo angioplasty, 1 pedal bypass graft). The pedal arch was classified as category I in 1 patient (3%), category IIa in 12 (38%), IIb in 3 (9%), and III in 16 patients (50%). No statistical significant differences in terms of survival or wound-healing rate were observed between those groups, and the pedal arch quality had no impact on predefined end points.\nCONCLUSIONS: End-stage renal disease patients represent a subgroup with poor prognosis of limb salvage in CLI. Amputation-free survival remains poor and based on these data, an endovascular therapy is feasible and safe in these highly multimorbid patients. The quality of the pedal arch was not found to have any impact on wound healing or survival in the present study.",

        "Abstract":"Infective endocarditis (IE) is a severe illness associated with significant morbidity and mortality. The primary purpose of this study was to evaluate morbidity and mortality of IE in a hospital serving the most diverse area in New York City. An analysis of 209 patients admitted to the hospital from 2000 to 2012 who were found to have IE based on modified Duke criteria. Among the 209 patients with IE, 188 (88.8%) had native heart valves and 21 (11.2%) had prosthetic valves. Of the patients with native heart valves, 3.7% had coronary artery bypass graft, 4.3% were active drug users, 6.3% had permanent pacemakers, 12.2% had a history of IE, 25.7% were diabetic, 17% had end-stage renal disease (ESRD), 9% had congestive heart failure, 8% had abnormal heart valves, and 13.8% had an unknown etiology. Mortality rates of the patients with prosthetic heart valves were 27.7% compared to 8.11% in patients with native heart valves (OR 3, p<0.0001). Since we identified diabetes mellitus and ESRD to be significant risk factors in our population, we isolated and compared characteristics of patients with and without IE. IE among patients with diabetes mellitus was 23% compared with 13.8% in the control group (p=0.016). Cases of IE in patients with ESRD were 15.3%, compared with 4% in the control group (p<0.0001). We identified an overall mortality rate of 20.1% in patients with IE, a readmission rate within 30 days of discharge of 21.5%, and an average age of 59 years. Among 209 patients, 107 were males and 102 females. The most common organisms identified were Staphylococcus aureus (43.7%), viridans streptococci (17%) followed by Enterococcus (14.7%). Despite appropriate treatment, high rates of morbidity and mortality remained, with a higher impact in patients greater than 50 years of age.

Many patients with thin ASDH and mild neurologic deficit are managed conservatively, but sometimes aggravation of thin ASDH to chronic subdural hematoma (CSDH) results in exacerbated clinical symtoms and consequently requires surgery. The aim of this study is to evaluate risk factors that indicate progression of initially non-operated ASDH to CSDH.\nMETHODS: We divided 177 patients, presenting with ASDH (managed conservatively initially) between January 2008 to December 2013, into two groups; 'CSDH progression group' (n=16) and 'non-CSDH progression group' (n=161). Patient's data including age, sex, past medical history, medication were collected and brain computed tomography was used for radiologic analysis.\nRESULTS: Our data demonstrated that no significant intergroup difference with respect to age, sex ratio, co-morbid conditions, medication history, ischemic heart disease, liver disease and end-stage renal disease was found. However, Hounsfield unit (hematoma density) and mixed density was higher in the 'ASDH progression group' (67.50±7.63) than in the 'non-CSDH progression group' (61.53±10.69) (p=0.031). Midline shifting and hematoma depth in the 'CSDH progression group' were significantly greater than the 'non-CSDH progression group' (p=0.067, p=0.005).\nCONCLUSION: Based on the results of this study, the risk factors that are related to progression of initially non-operated ASDH to CSDH are higher Hounsfield unit and hematoma depth. Therefore, we suggest that ASDH patients, who have bigger hematoma depth and higher Hounsfield unit, should be monitored and managed carefully during the follow-up period.",

        "Abstract":"INTRODUCTION: The use of transplants from extended criteria donors increases the number of urological complications after renal transplantation. Two different anastomosis techniques used to restore urinary continuity are compared in this study.\nPATIENTS AND METHODS: Retrospective study, bi-center over a period of 5 years. One hundred and seventy six patients operated at Hospices Civils de Lyon benefited from ureteroneocystostomy according to De Campos-Freire (group 1) and 167 patients operated at the Necker Hospital in Paris had a pyelo-ureterostomy (group 2). The various urological complications (fistulas, strictures, seromas, haematomas and vesico-ureteric reflux) and their care were compared. Risk factors were sought.\nRESULTS: The waiting time before transplantation was longer in group 2 than in group 1 (51 and 33.84 months) as the percentage of anuric patients (52.9 % against 32.9 %) (P<0.001). The cold ischemic time was shorter in group 1 (939.3minutes on average against 1325.3minutes for group 2) (P<0.001). A double J stent was put in place in 97.6 % of cases in group 2 against 84.2 % for group 1 (P<0.001). We did not find any significant difference in the occurrence of stenosis and fistulas (major complications) between the 2 groups. There were more minor complications (hematoma, seroma and vesico-ureteric reflux) in group 1 (P=0.033). There was a difference in the treatment of these complications, especially stenosis (P=0.024) with a significantly more conservative approach in group 2. Multivariate analysis found anuria, sex of recipients and donor age as independent risk factors in the onset of complications and the double J stent as a protective factor.\nCONCLUSION: This study does not demonstrate the superiority of a urinary anastomosis technique. The establishment of a double J stent reduces the risk of complications. Analysis of risk factors allows to propose a decision tree to guide the surgical strategy, particularly in the population of anuric recipients.\nLEVEL OF EVIDENCE: 5.",

        "Published":"2016-03-17",
        "Abstract":"AIM: Chronic kidney disease (CKD) is a powerful predictor of major cardiovascular events and stent thrombosis (ST) in patients undergoing percutaneous coronary interventions (PCI). No randomized data are available to compare, and guide the selection of type of stent between bare metal (BMS) or drug eluting stent (DES) in this population.\nMETHODS AND RESULTS: We performed a post-hoc analysis of the PROlonging Dual antiplatelet treatment after Grading stent-induced Intimal hyperplasia studY (PRODIGY) trial, in which stable or unstable patients with coronary artery disease undergoing PCI were randomized 1:1:1:1 to receive BMS, paclitaxel- (PES), zotarolimus- (ZES-S), or everolimus- (EES) eluting stent. A total of 2003 patients were randomized, and 22 patients were excluded for missing serum creatinine leading to a final population of 1981 patients. Primary outcome was definite or probable ST. We also assessed MACE (myocardial infarction, stroke, or death), and all-cause death, as secondary outcome. CKD, defined with estimated glomerular filtration rate <60ml\/min\/1.73m(2), was found in 373 patients (18.8%). The incidence of ST at 2years was 5.1% in CKD and 2.1% in non-CKD patients (HR 2.57, 95% confidence interval (CI) 1.46 to 4.52, p<0.001). At multivariable regression we found that patients randomized to EES or ZES-S, but not PES, had lower risk of ST at two years as compared with BMS: adjusted HR=0.288, 95% CI [0.107-0.778, p=0.014] and HR=0.394, 95% CI [0.164-0.947, p=0.037] respectively. The number of patients needed to be treated to prevent 1 ST with an EES vs BMS was 20 in CKD and 50 in patients without CKD. EES patients had the lowest incident MACE events 26.4% as compared to BMS 35.1%, ZES-S 33.0%, or PES 35.7% patients, p=0.551. All-cause death was lowest in ZES-S group 10.6% as compared to BMS 18.1%, PES 25.5% and EES 14.9%, p=0.040. We found no significant interaction between DAPT duration (6 vs 24months) and stent type on primary outcome, PINT=0.47 for BMS, PINT=0.57 for PES, PINT=0.41 for ZES-S and PINT=0.28 for EES.\nCONCLUSIONS: In an all-comer population of patients with stable and unstable CAD, CKD at baseline was associated with a double risk of ST and MACE. CKD patients receiving EES had less than half risk of ST 2years after PCI as compared with BMS and PES. Our analysis suggests that 2nd generation limus-based stent should be favored over paclitaxel-based DES or BMS to reduce ST and MACE in CKD patients.",

The primary study endpoint was the rate of target lesion failure (TLF), defined as a composite of cardiac death, target vessel-myocardial infarction (MI) or target lesion revascularization (TLR), at 1 year.\nRESULTS: Women were underrepresented in the RCT compared to the registry (25 vs. 29.4 %, p = 0.020). Non-participants were older compared to study participants (69.2 ± 12.4 vs. 67.0 ± 11.6, p < 0.001), and had a higher prevalence of previous cerebrovascular events (10.8 vs. 5.2 %, p < 0.001), and chronic renal failure (35.5 vs. 15.6 %, p < 0.001).

Differences in baseline clinical and angiographic characteristics were adjusted using a 1:5 propensity score matching analysis (n = 261 for BP-DES and n = 1305 for 2G-DP-DES). The primary outcome was the incidence of major adverse cardiac events (MACE) including all-cause death, recurrent myocardial infarction (re-MI), and target vessel revascularization (TVR). The rate of definite or probable ST was also investigated.\nRESULTS: In adjusted analysis, there was no significant difference between the 2 groups in baseline clinical and angiographic characteristics; 2-year MACE (10.7% and 9.9% in the BP-DES group and 2G-DP-DES group, respectively, P = 0.679); ST incidence (0.8% vs 0.9%, respectively, P = 1.0), and rates of all-cause death, re-MI, and TVR. By multivariate analysis, old age, diabetes mellitus, renal dysfunction, and left ventricular dysfunction were the independent predictors of MACE after BP-DES or 2G-DP-DES implantation.\nCONCLUSIONS: BP-DES and 2G-DP-DES appear to have comparable 2-year safety and efficacy for the treatment of AMI.

Few studies have focused on patients with end-stage renal disease.\nOBJECTIVES: This study compared mortality and cardiovascular morbidity during percutaneous coronary intervention with DES and with BMS in dialysis patients.\nMETHODS: We identified 36,117 dialysis patients from the USRDS (United States Renal Data System) who had coronary stenting in the United States between April 23, 2003, and December 31, 2010, and examined the association of DES versus BMS with 1-year outcomes: death; death or MI; and death, MI, or repeat revascularization. We also conducted a temporal analysis by dividing the study period into 3 DES eras: Transitional (April 23, 2003, to June 30, 2004); Liberal (July 1, 2004, to December 31, 2006); and Selective (January 1, 2007, to December 31, 2010).\nRESULTS: One-year event rates were high, with 38 deaths; 55 death or MI events; and 71 death, MI, or repeat revascularization events per 100 person-years. DES, compared with BMS, were associated with a significant 18% lower risk of death; 16% lower risk of death or MI; and 13% lower risk of death, MI, or repeat revascularization. DES use varied, from 56% in the Transitional era to 85% in the Liberal era and 62% in the Selective era. DES outcomes in the Liberal era were significantly better than in the Transitional Era, but not significantly better than in the Selective Era.\nCONCLUSIONS: DES for percutaneous coronary intervention appears to be safe for use in U.S. dialysis patients and is associated with lower rates of death, MI, and repeat revascularization.",

Patient characteristics, clinical outcomes, and treatment patterns were analyzed according to baseline renal function and the development of AKI. A prediction model for AKI after primary PCI for STEMI was also developed.\nRESULTS: A total of 5,244 patients were included in this analysis and stratified according to baseline estimated glomerular filtration rate (eGFR) (milliliters per minute per 1.73 m(2)) of >90, 60 to 90, 30 to 59, or <30 or as dialysis dependent.

Clinical risk factors may affect clinical outcomes after percutaneous coronary interventions. We present a retrospective analysis of the BASKET-PROVE data addressing the question as to whether the optimal type of stent can be predicted based on a cumulative clinical risk score.\nMETHODS: A total of 2,314 patients (mean age 66 years) who underwent coronary angioplasty and implantation of ≥1 stents that were ≥3.0 mm in diameter were randomly assigned to receive SES, EES, or BMS. A cumulative clinical risk score was derived using a Cox model that included age, gender, cardiovascular risk factors (hypercholesterolemia, hypertension, family history of cardiovascular disease, diabetes, smoking), presence of ≥2 comorbidities (stroke, peripheral artery disease, chronic kidney disease, chronic rheumatic disease), a history of MI or coronary revascularization, and clinical presentation (stable angina, unstable angina, ST-segment elevation MI).\nRESULTS: An aggregate drug-eluting stent (DES) group (n = 1,549) comprising 775 patients receiving SES and 774 patients receiving EES was compared to 765 patients receiving BMS. Rates of death from cardiac causes or nonfatal MI at 2 years of follow-up were significantly increased in patients who were in the high tertile of risk stratification for the clinical risk score compared to those who were in the aggregate low-mid tertiles. In patients with a high clinical risk score, rates of death from cardiac causes or nonfatal MI were lower in patients receiving DES (2.4 per 100 person-years, 95% CI 1.6-3.6) compared with BMS (5.5 per 100 person-years, 95% CI 3.7-8.2, hazard ratio 0.45, 95% CI 0.26-0.80, P = .007). However, they were not significantly different between receivers of DES and BMS in patients in the low-mid risk tertiles.\nCONCLUSIONS: This exploratory analysis suggests that, in patients who require stenting of a large coronary artery, use of a clinical risk score may identify those patients for whom DES use may confer a clinical advantage over BMS, beyond lower restenosis rates.",

However, neostigmine is contraindicated in renal failure, so it is underused in ACPO patients with renal failure who would be otherwise appropriate candidates. We described the first successfully treated case of acute kidney injury (AKI) with neostigmine in a patient with ACPO. A 72-year-old man who underwent a coronary artery bypass graft surgery 11 days prior presented to the emergency room with abdominal distension, peripheral edema, and dyspnea on exertion. Plain abdominal radiographs and abdomen computed tomography scan showed diffuse colonic dilatation without obstruction. Serum creatinine level was increased five-fold over baseline. We diagnosed the patient as ACPO with AKI. With conservative treatment, renal function failed to improve because the ACPO was not corrected. Administration of neostigmine rapidly resolved ACPO and renal function, avoiding more invasive procedures such as colonoscopic decompression and hemodialysis. Neostigmine appears to be an effective and safe treatment option for ACPO patients with renal failure. Prospective large-scale studies should be carried out to determine the safety and efficacy of neostigmine in ACPO patients with renal failure.",

        "Abstract":"BACKGROUND: Appropriate treatment methods lead to a reduced rate of mortality and morbidity, and an improved quality of life, in patients with multi-vessel coronary artery disease.\nOBJECTIVES: In this study, we compared short and long-term outcomes of coronary artery bypass grafting (CABG) versus medical therapy in patients 80 years of age and older with multi-vessel coronary artery disease (MVCAD).\nPATIENTS AND METHODS: In this retrospective study, 50 octogenarian patients with MVCAD who underwent CABG were compared with 50 patients in the same condition who were treated with medical therapy during the same time. The primary objective was to compare mortality and morbidity rates, as well as other factors such as the occurrence of chest pain, deterioration of the NYHA functional class, and re-hospitalization, between the two groups. The comparison was made using medical records from the five years post-treatment.\nRESULTS: After five years, the overall mortality rate included 11 patients (22%) in the CABG group versus 18 patients (36%) in the medical therapy group; this difference was not significant between the two groups (P = 0.186). Regarding short-term outcomes, in the CABG group, cardiogenic shock occurred in 9 patients (18%), renal failure in 13 patients (26%), pulmonary complications in 9 patients (18%) and neurologic complications in 3 patients (6%); in the medical therapy group, these same complications occurred, respectively, in 6 patients (12%), 7 patients (14%), 10 patients (20%) and 1 patient (2%). In addition to these factors, freedom from chest pain and improvement in the functional class among the CABG group was significantly higher than among the medical therapy group (P = <0.001).\nCONCLUSIONS: CABG may be the superior form of treatment for long-term outcomes in terms of the relief of chest pain, improvement of the functional class, reduced need for re-admission, and later death for octogenarians. However, short-term morbidity may be higher among the CABG group, but the mortality rate after 30 days is quite similar.",

Since the introduction of percutaneous coronary intervention (PCI), the revascularization therapy has evolved with advances of devices, improvements in operator techniques, and the establishment of medical therapy. We examined temporal trends of the clinical outcomes following PCI in patients with renal insufficiency.\nMETHODS: Patients with renal insufficiency after PCI at Juntendo University across three eras (plain balloon angioplasty, bare metal stent (BMS), and drug-eluting stent (DES)) were examined in this study. The primary endpoint was a composite of all-cause mortality, nonfatal acute coronary syndrome, nonfatal stroke, and repeat revascularization within 3-years after the index revascularization.\nRESULTS: A total of 1,420 patients were examined. Baseline characteristics have become unfavorable over time, whereas administration rate of medications for secondary prevention has increased. The event-free survival rates for the endpoint were different among the groups. Adjusted relative risk reduction for the endpoint was 35% and 51% in the BMS and DES eras (using the plain angioplasty era as reference). The adjusted relative risk reduction of the DES era was 26% compared with that of the BMS era.\nCONCLUSIONS: The incidence of cardiovascular events after PCI has reduced during the 26-year period mainly because of the reduction in repeat revascularization in patients with renal insufficiency, despite the higher risk profiles in the recent era.",

Gender differences have been reported in thrombotic and hemorrhagic risk during dual antiplatelet therapy (DAPT), thus suggesting a potential variability in platelet reactivity according to sex. The aim of the present study was to assess the role of gender on platelet function and the prevalence of high-on treatment residual platelet reactivity (HRPR) during DAPT in patients with recent acute coronary syndrome or percutaneous coronary revascularization.\nMETHODS: Patients treated with DAPT (ASA and clopidogrel or ticagrelor) were scheduled for platelet function assessment at 30-90 days post-discharge. By whole blood impedance aggregometry, HRPR was considered for ASPI test >862 AU*min (for ASA) and ADP test values ≥417 AU*min (for ADP-antagonists).\nRESULTS: We included 541 patients on DAPT, 122 (22.6 %) of whom were females. Females were older (p < 0.001), displayed more frequently hypercholesterolemia (p = 0.003), renal failure (p = 0.04), acute presentation (p < 0.001), higher cholesterol levels and platelets count (p < 0.001).

We established a prospective observational nationwide multicenter registry to evaluate current treatment and outcomes in patients with both CKD and angiographically documented CAD.\nMETHODS: In 32 cardiological centers 3,352 CAD patients with ≥50% stenosis in at least one coronary artery were enrolled and classified according to their estimated glomerular filtration rate and proteinuria into one of five stages of CKD or as a control group.\nRESULTS: 2,723 (81.2%) consecutively enrolled patients suffered from CKD. Compared to controls, CKD patients had a higher prevalence of diabetes, hypertension, peripheral artery diseases, heart failure, and valvular heart disease (each p<0.001). Myocardial infarctions (p = 0.02), coronary bypass grafting, valve replacements and pacemaker implantations had been recorded more frequently (each p<0.001). With advanced CKD, the number of diseased coronary vessels and the proportion of patients with reduced left ventricular ejection fraction (LVEF) increased significantly (both p<0.001). Percutaneous coronary interventions were performed less frequently (p<0.001) while coronary bypass grafting was recommended more often (p = 0.04) with advanced CKD. With regard to standard drugs in CAD treatment, prescriptions were higher in our registry than in previous reports, but beta-blockers (p = 0.008), and angiotensin-converting-enzyme inhibitors and\/or angiotensin-receptor blockers (p<0.001) were given less often in higher CKD stages. In contrast, in the subgroup of patients with moderately to severely reduced LVEF the prescription rates did not differ between CKD stages. In-hospital mortality increased stepwise with each CKD stage (p = 0.02).\nCONCLUSIONS: In line with other studies comprising CKD cohorts, patients' morbidity and in-hospital mortality increased with the degree of renal impairment. Although cardiologists' drug prescription rates in CAD-REF were higher than in previous studies, they were still lower especially in advanced CKD stages compared to cohorts treated by nephrologists.",

        "Abstract":"OBJECTIVES: This multicenter, prospective, post-market surveillance study in Japan evaluates the paclitaxel-coated Zilver PTX stent in real-world patients with complex lesions.\nBACKGROUND: The Zilver PTX stent is the first drug-eluting stent (DES) approved for the superficial femoral artery. Previously, results from a large randomized study and a complementary, large single-arm study supported the safety and effectiveness of the DES.\nMETHODS: There were no exclusion criteria, and consecutive patients with symptomatic peripheral artery disease (PAD) treated with the DES were enrolled in the study. Clinically driven target lesion revascularization (TLR) was defined as reintervention performed for ≥50% diameter stenosis after recurrent clinical symptoms of PAD. Clinical benefit was defined as freedom from persistent or worsening symptoms of ischemia. Patency was evaluated by duplex ultrasound where physicians considered this standard of care.\nRESULTS: In this study, 907 patients were enrolled at 95 institutions in Japan. There were numerous comorbidities including high incidences of diabetes (58.8%), chronic kidney disease (43.8%), and critical limb ischemia (21.5%). Lesions were also complex, with an average length of 14.7 cm, 41.6% total occlusions, and 18.6% in-stent restenosis. In total, 1,861 DES were placed in 1,075 lesions. Twelve-month follow-up was obtained for >95% of eligible patients. Freedom from TLR was 91.0%, and clinical benefit was 87.7% through 12 months. The 12-month primary patency rate was 86.4%.\nCONCLUSIONS: Despite more challenging lesions, results from the current study are similar to outcomes from the previous Zilver PTX studies, confirming the benefit of the Zilver PTX DES in a real-world patient population.

The study cohort was divided into ESRD patients (n = 102) and patients with normal renal function (n = 674; glomerular filtration rate >60\/mL\/min\/1.73 m(2)). The following first-line treatment strategies were assessed: endovascular therapy (EVT), bypass surgery, patch plasty, and no vascular intervention (conservative treatment, primary amputation). Uni- and multivariate analyses were performed to identify differences between groups as to six end points: amputation or death (composite end point), amputation, death, hemodynamic failure, major adverse cardiac and cerebrovascular events, and reintervention.\nRESULTS: Differences between the ESRD and non-ESRD group were found regarding the applied first-line therapy (P = .016): The first-line treatment strategies in ESRD patients were EVT in 64% (n = 65), bypass surgery in 13% (n = 13), patch plasty in 11% (n = 11), and no vascular intervention in 13% (n = 13).

However, recurrent restenosis still occurs following DEB use. Our study aimed to identify the associations of target lesion restenosis following DEB use over a 1-year clinical follow-up.Between November 2011 and May 2014, 246 patients were diagnosed with coronary artery ISR in our hospital. A total of 335 coronary ISR lesions were treated with DEBs. The 1-year patent coronary artery group was defined as those with negative noninvasive examinations and no clinical symptoms, or those with no angiographic restenosis. The 1-year current restenosis group was defined as those with angiographic restenosis. Clinical results were compared between 2 groups. Univariate and multivariate cox regression analyses were performed to identify the associations of target lesion restenosis following DEB use.Patients' average age was 64.96 ± 10.68 years, and 77.2% were men. Non-ST segment elevation myocardial infarction was more frequent as the clinical presentation in the 1-year current restenosis group, whereas stable angina was more frequent in the 1-year patent coronary artery group. The 1-year current restenosis group exhibited higher percentages of comorbidities, including hypertension, diabetes, prior myocardial infarction, heart failure, prior coronary artery bypass grafting, and end-stage renal disease (ESRD). Regardless of ostial ISR or nonostial ISR, the results of drug-eluting stent ISR were worse than those for bare-metal stent ISR. Multivariate analysis revealed that ESRD, and coronary ostial lesion, and the severity of pre-PCI stenosis were independently associated with target lesion restenosis following DEB use (P = 0.020, P = 0.009, P = 0.026, respectively).ESRD, and coronary ostial lesion, and the severity of pre-PCI stenosis were independently associated with recurrent target lesion restenosis following DEB use.",

The INT cohort included 284 patients who underwent CABG from June 2013 to February 2014. The CI cohort included 232 patients who underwent CABG from April to December 2014, after an intraoperative CI cefazolin protocol for cardiac surgery patients undergoing CPB was adopted in March 2014.\nMEASUREMENTS AND MAIN RESULTS: The primary end point was incidence of SSIs, and safety end points of renal dysfunction and seizures were evaluated. Multivariable logistic regression analysis was used to determine the impact on SSIs when controlling for other risk factors. A subgroup analysis for this study included 2 months within each time period to evaluate protocol adherence. The overall incidence of SSIs was decreased in patients receiving CI cefazolin, although this did not reach statistical significance (4.6% in the INT cohort vs 1.7% in the CI cohort, p=0.116). Superficial SSIs were significantly reduced in the CI cohort (2.8% in the INT cohort vs 0.4% in the CI cohort, p=0.039). In the regression analysis, CI cefazolin decreased the odds of SSI by 66%, although it did not reach statistical significance (p=0.077). Safety end points were not significantly different between groups. Overall protocol adherence did not differ significantly between the cohorts: 77% in the INT cohort and 67% in the CI cohort (p=0.212).\nCONCLUSION: CI cefazolin significantly decreased the incidence of superficial SSIs compared with INT cefazolin in patients undergoing CABG on CPB, without increasing the risk for adverse effects. As this study was underpowered to detect a significant difference in overall SSIs, larger, randomized studies are required to validate the superiority of CI cefazolin.",

Our aim was to compare three therapeutic strategies for CAD in diabetic patients stratified by renal function.\nMETHODS: Patients with multivessel CAD that underwent coronary artery bypass graft (CABG), angioplasty (percutaneous coronary intervention [PCI]), or medical therapy alone (MT) were included. Data were analyzed according to glomerular filtration rate in three strata: normal (>90 mL\/min), mild CKD (60 to 89 mL\/min), and moderate CKD (30 to 59 mL\/min). End points comprised overall rate of mortality, acute myocardial infarction, and need for additional revascularization.\nRESULTS: Among patients with normal renal function (n = 270), 122 underwent CABG, 72 PCI, and 76 MT; among patients with mild CKD (n = 367), 167 underwent CABG, 92 PCI, and 108 MT; and among patients with moderate CKD (n = 126), 46 underwent CABG, 40 PCI, and 40 MT.

The study population was categorized by creatinine clearance (CrCl) <45 ml\/min, 45 to 59 ml\/min, and ≥60 ml\/min. The primary endpoint was the 3-year rate of major adverse cardiovascular events (MACE). Participants for whom baseline creatinine was missing were excluded from the analysis.\nRESULTS: Of 4,217 women included in the pooled cohort treated with DES and for whom serum creatinine was available, 603 (14%) had a CrCl <45 ml\/min, 811 (19%) had a CrCl 45 to 59 ml\/min, and 2,803 (66%) had a CrCl ≥60 ml\/min. A significant stepwise gradient in risk for MACE was observed with worsening renal function (26.6% vs. 15.8% vs. 12.9%; p < 0.01). Following multivariable adjustment, CrCl <45 ml\/min was independently associated with a higher risk of MACE (adjusted hazard ratio: 1.56; 95% confidence interval: 1.23 to 1.98) and all-cause mortality (adjusted hazard ratio: 2.67; 95% confidence interval: 1.85 to 3.85). Compared with older-generation DES, the use of newer-generation DES was associated with a reduction in the risk of cardiac death, myocardial infarction, or stent thrombosis in women with CKD. The effect of new-generation DES on outcomes was uniform, between women with or without CKD, without evidence of interaction.\nCONCLUSIONS: Among women undergoing PCI with DES, CKD is a common comorbidity associated with a strong and independent risk for MACE that is durable over 3 years. The benefits of newer-generation DES are uniform in women with or without CKD.",

After adjustment for imbalanced baseline variables, patients with moderate\/severe CAC had higher 2 year rates of major adverse cardiac events (18.3% vs 13.5%, p = 0.01) and death (10.3% vs 5.6%, p = 0.02).\nCONCLUSIONS: Moderate\/severe CAC was associated with increased clinical events in patients who underwent PCI with TAXUS stents. This may be explained in part due to differences important baseline characteristics including more patients with more comorbidities and more complex lesions. After adjustment for imbalanced baseline variables, the moderate\/severe CAC group had a higher risk of major adverse cardiac events and death. Improvements in treatment strategies are needed for this high-risk group of patients who undergo PCI. © 2016 Wiley Periodicals, Inc.",

        "Abstract":"Children undergoing cardiac surgery requiring cardiopulmonary bypass (CPB) frequently develop acute kidney injury due to renal ischemia. Theophylline, which improves renal perfusion via adenosine receptor inhibition, is a potential targeted therapy. However, children undergoing cardiac surgery and CPB commonly have alterations in drug pharmacokinetics. To help understand optimal aminophylline (salt formulation of theophylline) dosing strategies in this population, a population-based pharmacokinetic model was developed using nonlinear mixed-effects modeling (NONMEM) from 71 children (median age 5 months; 90% range 1 week to 10 years) who underwent cardiac surgery requiring CPB and received aminophylline as part of a previous randomized controlled trial. A 1-compartment model with linear elimination adequately described the pharmacokinetics of theophylline. Weight scaled via allometry was a significant predictor of clearance and volume. In addition, allometric scaled clearance increased with age implemented as a power maturation function. Compared to prior reports in noncardiac children, theophylline clearance was markedly reduced across age. In the final population pharmacokinetic model, optimized empiric dosing regimens were developed via Monte Carlo simulations. Doses 50% to 75% lower than those recommended in noncardiac children were needed to achieve target serum concentrations of 5 to 10 mg\/L.",

Patients were divided into three groups by estimated glomerular filtration rate (eGFR): Normal group, eGFR ≥90 mL\/min\/1.73 m(2) (n = 233). Moderate group, eGFR 60-90 mL\/min\/1.73 m(2) (n = 108). RI group, eGFR <60 mL\/min\/1.73 m(2) (n = 95).

        "Abstract":"INTRODUCTION: Postoperative pain-management with non-steroid anti-inflammatory drugs has been controversial, due to related side-effects. We investigated whether there was a significant difference between an oxycodone-based pain-management regimen versus a slow-release ibuprofen based regimen, in a short term post-cardiac surgery setting. Particular attention was given to the rate of myocardial infarction, sternal healing, gastro-intestinal complications, renal failure and all-cause mortality.\nMETHODS: This was a single-centre, open label parallel design randomised controlled study. Patients, who were undergoing cardiac surgery for the first time, were randomly allocated either to a regimen of slow-release oxycodone (10 mg twice daily) or slow-release ibuprofen (800 mg twice daily) combined with lansoprazole. Data relating to blood-tests, angiographies, surgical details and administered medicine were obtained from patient records. The follow-up period was 1 to 37 months (median 25 months).\nRESULTS: One hundred eighty-two patients were included in the trial and available for intention to treat analysis. There were no significant difference between the groups (P>0.05) in the rates of sternal healing, postoperative myocardial infarction or gastrointestinal bleeding. The preoperative levels of creatinine were found to increase by 100% in nine patients (9.6%) in the ibuprofen group, resulting in an acute renal injury (in accordance with the RIFLE-criteria). Eight of these patients returned to normal renal function within 14 days. The levels of creatinine in patients in the oxycodone group were not found to increase to the same magnitude.\nCONCLUSION: The results of this study suggest that patients treated postoperatively, following cardiac surgery, are at no greater risk of harm if short term slow release ibuprofen combined with lansoprazole treatment is used when compared to an oxycodone based regimen. Renal function should, however, be closely monitored and in the event of any decrease in renal function ibuprofen must be discontinued.",

To categorize the risk of future cardiovascular events in drug-eluting stent (DES)-treated patients, we analyzed demographic, clinical, and procedural data in all-comers who underwent a percutaneous coronary intervention (PCI).\nMETHODS: Patients who underwent PCI using DES from January 2004 were prospectively enrolled in the Catholic University of Korea-PCI registry and were followed up for a median of 2 years. We analyzed the risk of clinical outcomes in the all-patient cohort and in subsets of patients with angina and acute myocardial infarction (AMI).\nRESULTS: The patients were categorized into two groups: those with angina (angina group, n=6183, 67.7%) and those with AMI (AMI group, n=2944, 32.3%). The AMI group had greater occurrence of major adverse cardiac events (MACE) during long-term follow-up than the angina group (23.8 vs. 20.1%, P<0.001). However, in the landmark analysis of data beyond 1 year, there was no significant difference in the occurrence of MACE between the two groups (P=0.44). In multivariable modeling, age, renal function, left ventricular ejection fraction, and multivessel disease were associated significantly with increasing MACE in the study population, angina or AMI groups.\nCONCLUSION: We found that higher MACE in patients with AMI during long-term follow-up after PCI was mainly because of higher mortality in the first year. Some demographic, clinical, and angiographic factors still significantly influence the long-term occurrence of MACE in the era of DES.",

Monocytes\/macrophages are the major source of HO-1 and higher levels improve renal transplant outcomes. Heme arginate (HA) safely induces HO-1 in humans.\nMETHODS: The Heme Oxygenase-1 in renal Transplantation study was a randomized, placebo-controlled, IIb trial to evaluate HA effect on HO-1 upregulation after deceased donor kidney transplantation. 40 recipients were randomized to either 3 mg kg HA or placebo (0.9% NaCl), given preoperatively (day 0) and again on day 2. Recipient blood and urine were collected daily. Graft biopsies were taken preoperatively and on day 5. Primary outcome was HO-1 upregulation in peripheral blood mononuclear cells (PBMCs). Secondary outcomes were graft HO-1 upregulation and injury, urinary biomarkers, and renal function.\nRESULTS: The HA upregulated PBMC HO-1 protein more than placebo at 24 hours: HA 11.1 ng\/mL versus placebo 0.14 ng\/mL (P = < 0.0001). The PBMC HO-1 messenger RNA also increased: HA 2.73-fold versus placebo 1.41-fold (P = 0.02). Heme arginate increased day 5 tissue HO-1 protein immunopositivity compared with placebo: HA 0.21 versus placebo -0.03 (P = 0.02) and % HO-1-positive renal macrophage also increased: HA 50.8 cells per high power field versus placebo 22.3 (P = 0.012). Urinary biomarkers were reduced after HA but not significantly. Histological injury and renal function were similar but the study was not powered for this. Adverse events were equivalent between groups.\nCONCLUSIONS: The primary outcome was achieved and demonstrated for the first time that HA safely induces HO-1 in transplant recipients. Planned larger studies will determine the impact of HO-1 upregulation on clinical outcomes and evaluate the benefit to patients at risk of ischemia-reperfusion injury.",

However, selected treatment populations with DES contraindications such as patients who cannot sustain 6-12 months of dual antiplatelet therapy (DAPT) remain candidates for BMS implantations.\nMETHODS: Thin strut bare metal stenting in a priori defined subgroups were investigated in a non-randomized, international, multicenter «all comers» observational study. Primary endpoint was the 9-month TLR rate whereas secondary endpoints included the 9-month MACE and procedural success rates.\nRESULTS: A total of 783 patients of whom 98 patients had AF underwent BMS implantation.

We compared the performance of the CRUSADE (Can Rapid Risk Stratification of Unstable Angina Patients Suppress Adverse Outcomes With Early Implementation of the ACC\/AHA Guidelines), ACUITY (Acute Catheterization and Urgent Intervention Triage Strategy), and HAS-BLED (Hypertension, Abnormal Renal\/Liver Function, Stroke, Bleeding History or Predisposition, Labile INR, Elderly, Drugs\/Alcohol Concomitantly) scores in 1946 patients recruited in the Prolonging Dual Antiplatelet Treatment After Grading Stent-Induced Intimal Hyperplasia Study (PRODIGY) and assessed hemorrhagic and ischemic events in the 24- and 6-month dual antiplatelet therapy groups.\nMETHODS AND RESULTS: Bleeding score performance was assessed with a Cox regression model and C statistics. Discriminative and reclassification power was assessed with net reclassification improvement and integrated discrimination improvement. The C statistic was similar between the CRUSADE score (area under the curve 0.71) and ACUITY (area under the curve 0.68), and higher than HAS-BLED (area under the curve 0.63). CRUSADE, but not ACUITY, improved reclassification (net reclassification index 0.39, P=0.005) and discrimination (integrated discrimination improvement index 0.0083, P=0.021) of major bleeding compared with HAS-BLED. Major bleeding and transfusions were higher in the 24- versus 6-month dual antiplatelet therapy groups in patients with a CRUSADE score >40 (hazard ratio for bleeding 2.69, P=0.035; hazard ratio for transfusions 4.65, P=0.009) but not in those with CRUSADE score ≤40 (hazard ratio for bleeding 1.50, P=0.25; hazard ratio for transfusions 1.37, P=0.44), with positive interaction (Pint=0.05 and Pint=0.01, respectively). The number of patients with high CRUSADE scores needed to treat for harm for major bleeding and transfusion were 17 and 15, respectively, with 24-month rather than 6-month dual antiplatelet therapy; corresponding figures in the overall population were 67 and 71, respectively.\nCONCLUSIONS: Our analysis suggests that the CRUSADE score predicts major bleeding similarly to ACUITY and better than HAS BLED in an all-comer population with percutaneous coronary intervention and potentially identifies patients at higher risk of hemorrhagic complications when treated with a long-term dual antiplatelet therapy regimen.\nCLINICAL TRIAL REGISTRATION: URL: http:\/\/clinicaltrials.gov.

The study population was divided into two groups: patients presenting with anaemia 217 (11%) and without anaemia 1699 (89%) prior to PCI. Anaemia was defined according to World Heart Organisation (haemoglobin [Hb] level < 13 g\/dL for men and < 12 g\/dL for women). Patients with anaemia were older (69, IQR: 61-75 vs. 62, IQR: 56-70, p < 0.001), had higher prevalence of co-morbidities: diabetes (44.7% vs. 36.4%, p = 0.020), chronic kidney disease (31.3% vs. 19.4%; p < 0.001), peripheral artery disease (10.1% vs. 5.4%, p = 0.005), and lower left ventricular ejection fraction values (50, IQR: 40-57% vs. 55, IQR: 45-60%; p < 0.001). No difference between gender in frequency of anaemia was found. Patients with anaemia more often had prior myocardial infarction (MI) (57.6% vs. 46.4%; p = 0.002) and coronary artery bypass grafting (31.3% vs. 19.4%; p < 0.001) in comparison to patients without anaemia.

In-hospital risk of acute heart failure (2.7% vs. 0.7%; p = 0.006) and bleeding requiring transfusion (3.2% vs. 0.5%; p < 0.001) was significantly higher in patients with anaemia. One-year follow-up showed that there was higher rate of death in patients with anaemia. However, there were no differences in MI, stroke, target vessel revascularisation (TVR) and MACCE in comparison to patients with normal Hb. There were no differences according to type of DES (first vs. second generation) in the population of patients with anaemia.\nCONCLUSIONS: In patients with anaemia there is a significantly higher risk of death in 12-month follow-up, but anaemia has no impact on the incidence of MI, repeat revascularisation, stroke and MACCE. There is no advantage of II-DES over I-DES generation in terms of MACCE and TVR in patients with anaemia.",

Compared with controls, levosimendan reduced the incidence of postoperative AKI (40\/460 vs 78\/499; OR, 0.51; 95% CI, 0.34-0.76; P=0.001; I(2)=0.0%), renal replacement therapy (22\/492 vs 49\/491; OR, 0.43; 95% CI, 0.25-0.76; P=0.002; I(2)=0.0%), postoperative mortality (35\/658 vs 94\/657; OR, 0.41; 95% CI, 0.27-0.62; P<0.001; I(2)=0.0%), mechanical ventilation duration (in days; n=235; weighted mean difference, -0.34; 95% CI, -0.58 to -0.09; P=0.007], and intensive care unit stay (in days; n=500; weighted mean difference, -2.2; 95% CI, -4.21 to -0.13; P=0.04).\nLIMITATIONS: Different definitions for AKI among studies. Small sample size for some trials.\nCONCLUSIONS: Perioperative administration of levosimendan in patients undergoing cardiac surgery may reduce complications. Future trials are needed to determine the dose effect of levosimendan in improving outcomes, especially in patients with decreased baseline kidney function.",

Patient's mean age was 56 ± 17 (14~83) years and 36 males, 2 prior cardiac surgery-performed and 2 hemodialysis-dependent renal failure patients were included. All patients were followed on long-term basis. Mean follow up duration was 61 ± 46 (1~164) months. We classified patients into 2 groups according to urgency of surgical intervention:early surgical (ES) group who underwent surgery within 2 weeks from diagnosis of IE and conservative surgical (CS) group who underwent after 2 weeks more from the diagnosis.\nRESULTS: Two patients died during hospitalization due to low cardiac output syndrome (LOS) for ischemic myopathy after old myocardial infarction and postoperative ischemic colitis (preoperative hemodialysis-dependent patient). Two cerebral infarctions and 1 hemorrhagic transformation of cerebral infarction occurred postoperatively. There was no mediastinal infection and recurrent intracardiac infection postoperatively.

We describe an organ procurement organization-wide trial utilizing thrombolytic tissue plasminogen activator (tPA) during machine pulsatile perfusion (MPP). A kidney from each recovered kidney pair was prospectively randomized to receive tPA (50 mg Alteplase) or no tPA (control) in the MPP perfusate. From 2011 to 2013, 24 kidneys were placed with enrolled recipients from 19 DCD kidney donors. There were no significant differences for absolute values of flow or resistance while undergoing MPP between the groups, nor rates of achieving discrete flow and resistance targets. While there was a trend toward lower creatinine and higher glomerular filtration rates in the tPA group at 3, 6, 9, and 12 months, these differences were not significant. Delayed graft function (DGF) rates were 41.7% in the tPA group vs. 58.4% in the control group (OR 0.51, 95%CI 0.10-2.59, p = 0.68). Death-censored graft survival was similar between the groups. In this pilot study, encouraging trends are seen in kidney allograft function independent of MPP parameters following DCD kidney transplantation for those kidneys receiving thrombolytic tPA and MPP, compared with standard MPP.",

The presence of erectile dysfunction (ED) has been considered as a clinical sentinel of premature atherosclerosis. The objective of this study was to explore the predictive value of ED in assessing the discrepancy between VA and CA. In the period from 1 January 2014 to 1 January 2015, all consecutive men referring to the outpatient departments of the Clinics of Urology and Cardiology in Belgrade (Serbia) were considered for enrolment in this cross-sectional study. General exclusion criteria were: age below 18, heart failure, history of myocardial infarction, impaired renal and liver function, acute infection, history of endocrine disease other than type 2 diabetes, pelvic surgery or trauma, and acute coronary syndrome within the last 6 months. According to the presence of ED, hypertension, type 2 diabetes and history of coronary artery disease participants were assigned into five study groups. Hierarchical multiple regression analysis was conducted to identify the predictive value of ED in detection of advanced VA. The mean age of males enrolled in the study was 52.9 ± 7.7 years. The predominance of VA over CA was statistically significantly higher in the group of participants with coexistence of ED and hypertension compared to the group of patients with ED and type 2 diabetes (p = 0.027) and the group of patients with ED (p = 0.014) and control group (p < 0.01). Regression analysis highlighted that ED represented a highly important marker (p < 0.01) of advanced VA, which independently accounted for 6.1% of the variance in the discrepancy between VA and CA. Our study suggests that assessment of ED could be a part of a more comprehensive prediction of patients' advanced VA. Screening among such a highly selected population may help identify those that would most benefit from drug treatments and life style changes.",

Data have been registered in a database. Operation times, lukewarm ischemic times and postoperative complications have been compared within the 3 groups.\nRESULTS: A clear difference of operation time has been noted within the 3 groups with an average time of 202 minutes for Juniors 1, 173 minutes for Juniors 2 and 140 minutes for Seniors (P<0.0001).

        "Abstract":"AIM: Contrast-induced-nephropathy (CIN) is associated with poor outcomes, thus prevention of CIN may be of clinical value. Erythropoietin (EPO) has been shown to elicit tissue-protective effects in experimental models and in clinical studies of acute kidney injury. We therefore evaluated its effectiveness for prevention of CIN after coronary angiography (CA) ± percutaneous coronary intervention (PCI) in diabetic patients with chronic kidney disease.\nMETHODS: A prospective, randomized, controlled trial was carried out in 138 diabetic patients with eGFR <60 mL\/min who underwent non-urgent CA ± PCI. Patients received normal saline and n-acetyl cysteine before CA, with or without 50,000 U of EPO administered 30 min prior to CA. CIN was defined as an increase in serum creatinine of at least 0.5 mg\/dL during the first 2 days after exposure to contrast media. Primary outcome was the incidence of CIN. Secondary outcomes were the sensitivity and positive predictive value (PPV) of Cystatin C (CC) and Neutrophil-gelatinase-associated-lipocalin (NGAL) for diagnosis of CIN.\nRESULTS: The observed incidence of CIN was 8.7%, significantly lower than the expected for such high-risk population. The administration of EPO prior to CA did not reduce the incidence of CIN (9.7% vs. 7.6%, P = 0.65). CC and NGAL demonstrated a low sensitivity (16.6%) and low PPV (6.7 and 33.3%, respectively) for detecting CIN.\nCONCLUSION: The administration of EPO prior to CA did not reduce the incidence of CIN. Additional prospective research with a larger sample size and in other patient categories is essential to further define the potential protective effect of EPO on prevention of CIN.",

        "Abstract":"INTRODUCTION: N-acetylcysteine (NAC) and sodium bicarbonate (SOB) therapies may prevent contrast-induced nephropathy (CIN). However, the efficacy of using combination over individual therapies was not established, and there was no large randomised study comparing abbreviated SOB therapy with conventional sustained saline pre-hydration with oral NAC.\nMETHODS: In a multi-centre, open-label, randomised, controlled trial (NCT00497328), we prospectively enrolled 548 patients with at least moderate renal impairment undergoing cardiac catheterisation with or without percutaneous coronary intervention. Patients were randomly assigned to 3 groups: 1) NAC: 154 mEq\/L sustained sodium chloride regime (1 mL\/kg\/h 12 h before, during and 6h after the procedure) with oral NAC at 1.2g bid for 3 days (n=185); 2) SOB: 154 mEq\/L abbreviated SOB regime at 3 mL\/kg\/h 1h before the procedure, and 1 mL\/kg\/h during and 6h after the procedure (n=182); and 3) COM: combination of abbreviated SOB regime and oral NAC (n=181). The primary end point was incidence of CIN. The secondary end points were rise in serum creatinine, hospitalisation duration, haemodialysis, morbidity and mortality within 30 days.\nRESULTS: The 3 groups had similar baseline characteristics: age 68 ± 10 years, 76% male, 48% diabetic and baseline glomerular filtration rate (GFR) 47.7 ± 13.0 mL\/min. There were 41 (8.8%) patients with GFR<30. The CIN incidences were NAC 6.5%, SOB 12.8% and COM 10.6%. The COM regimen was not superior to either the NAC (relative risk (RR)=1.61, 95% confidence interval (CI): 0.76 to 3.45, p=0.225) or SOB (RR=0.83, 95% CI: 0.44 to 1.56, p=0.593) regimens. The CIN incidence was lower in the NAC group than the SOB group (adjusted odds ratio (OR)=0.40, 95% CI: 0.17 to 0.92; p=0.032). Multivariate analysis showed contrast volume (OR=1.99, 95% CI: 1.33 to 2.96, p<0.001 per 100mL), female (OR=2.47, 95% CI: 1.22 to 5.00, p=0.012) and diabetes (OR=2.03, 95% CI: 1.03 to 3.99, p=0.041) were independent risk predictors. There were no differences in the secondary outcomes among the 3 groups.\nCONCLUSION: The combination regimen was not superior to individual regimens in preventing CIN in patients with baseline renal impairment. There was a trend suggesting that the 12-hour sustained sodium chloride pre-hydration regimen was more protective than the 1-hour abbreviated SOB regimen.",

We excluded 7 salvage cases. The operative procedures included 56 coronary artery bypass graft surgeries, 43 valve procedures, 13 ventricular assist device implantations, 11 heart transplantations, 9 aortic surgeries, and 5 congenital defect repairs. Our preoperative optimization protocol for Jehovah's Witnesses includes discontinuing antiplatelets and adding iron\/vitamin or erythropoietin to achieve a target hemoglobin greater than 12 g\/dL. We evaluated the risk factors for postoperative mortality and composite outcomes (mortality, myocardial infarction, stroke, acute kidney injury, heart failure, sternal wound infection), and compared the outcomes of optimized patients with a preoperative hemoglobin level greater than 12 g\/dL (n = 93) versus unoptimized patients with a preoperative hemoglobin level less than 12 g\/dL (n = 44).\nRESULTS: Preoperative and intraoperative demographics in the optimized and unoptimized groups were similar except for preoperative hemoglobin levels, renal dysfunction (optimized = 25\/93 [26.9%], unoptimized = 26\/44 [59.1%], P < .001), and emergency\/urgent cases (optimized = 20\/93 [21.5%], unoptimized = 17\/44 [38.6%], P = .035). The mean preoperative, intraoperative nadir, and discharge hemoglobin levels of the entire cohort were 12.7 ± 1.7 g\/dL, 9.5 ± 2.6 g\/dL, and 9.7 ± 1.8 g\/dL, respectively. Hospital mortality was 9 of 137 patients (6.6%) (optimized = 2\/93 [2.2%], unoptimized = 7\/44 [15.9%], P = .002), and composite outcomes were observed in 44 of 137 patients (32.1%) (optimized = 21\/93 [22.6%], unoptimized = 22\/44 [50.0%], P = .001). The Youden index identified a cutoff value of the preoperative hemoglobin of 11.7 g\/dL for mortality (area under curve, 0.719; sensitivity, 77.8%; specificity, 76.0%). Multivariate analysis identified a suboptimal preoperative hemoglobin (<12 g\/dL) as the only important independent factor associated with mortality (odds ratio, 5.64; 95% confidence interval, 1.14-42.18) and composite outcomes (odds ratio, 2.49; 95% confidence interval, 1.06-5.88).\nCONCLUSIONS: Complex cardiovascular surgery in Jehovah's Witnesses was associated with acceptable surgical outcomes, especially if they electively completed optimization. Our Jehovah's Witnesses' optimization protocol targeting a hemoglobin level greater than 12 g\/dL seemed to be effective in reducing adverse events at The University of Chicago Medicine.",

The use of prasugrel was evaluated clinically in clopidogrel-naive patients.\nMETHODS: Between September 2009 and October 2012, a total of 2,023 STEMI patients were enrolled in the COMFORTABLE (Comparison of Biomatrix Versus Gazelle in ST-Elevation Myocardial Infarction [STEMI]) and the SPUM-ACS (Inflammation and Acute Coronary Syndromes) studies. Patients receiving a prasugrel loading dose were divided into 2 groups: 1) clopidogrel and a subsequent prasugrel loading dose; and 2) a prasugrel loading dose. The primary safety endpoint was Bleeding Academic Research Consortium types 3 to 5 bleeding in hospital at 30 days.\nRESULTS: Of 2,023 patients undergoing primary percutaneous coronary intervention, 427 (21.1%) received clopidogrel and a subsequent prasugrel loading dose, 447 (22.1%) received a prasugrel loading dose alone, and the remaining received clopidogrel only. At 30 days, the primary safety endpoint was observed in 1.9% of those receiving clopidogrel and a subsequent prasugrel loading dose and 3.4% of those receiving a prasugrel loading dose alone (adjusted hazard ratio [HR]: 0.57; 95% confidence interval [CI]: 0.25 to 1.30, p = 0.18). The HAS-BLED (hypertension, abnormal renal\/liver function, stroke, bleeding history or predisposition, labile international normalized ratio, elderly, drugs\/alcohol concomitantly) bleeding score tended to be higher in prasugrel-treated patients (p = 0.076).

Patient-level data from Patient Related Outcomes With Endeavor vs Cypher Stenting Trial (PROTECT), a broadly inclusive trial enrolling 8,709 subjects treated with drug-eluting stents (sirolimus vs zotarolimus-eluting stent), and PROTECT US, a single-arm study including 1,018 subjects treated with a zotarolimus-eluting stent, were combined. The risk of ischemic events, cardiovascular death\/non-periprocedural myocardial infarction (MI)\/definite or probable stent thrombosis, and bleeding events, Global Use of Strategies to Open Occluded Arteries moderate or severe bleed, were predicted using logistic regression. At median follow-up of 4.1 years, major bleeding occurred in 260 subjects (2.8%) and ischemic events in 595 (6.3%). Multivariate predictors of bleeding were older age, smoking, diabetes mellitus, congestive heart failure, and chronic kidney disease (all p <0.05). Ischemic events shared all the same predictors with bleeding events and gender, body mass index, previous MI, previous coronary artery bypass graft surgery, ST-segment elevation MI on presentation, stent length, and sirolimus-eluting stent use (all p <0.05). Within individual subjects, bleeding and ischemic risks were strongly correlated; 97% of subjects had a greater risk of ischemic events than bleeding.

After the intensive care unit (ICU), patients received a single treatment regimen in the hospital and 90 days postdischarge. Primary outcome was differences in a composite of complications, including mortality, wound infection, pneumonia, bacteremia, respiratory failure, acute kidney injury, and major cardiovascular events.\nRESULTS: Mean glucose in the ICU was 132 ± 14 mg\/dL (interquartile range [IQR] 124-139) in the intensive and 154 ± 17 mg\/dL (IQR 142-164) in the conservative group (P < 0.001).

        "Published":"2015-06-23",
        "Abstract":"BACKGROUND: In kidney transplantation, the use of Anti-Thymocyte Globulins (ATG) as induction therapy has been described as a possible treatment for reducing the prevalence of Delayed Graft Function (DGF). ATG possesses pharmaceutical proprieties that could help control the lesions caused by ischemia reperfusion injury. However, other studies have questioned this potential protective effect. We hypothesized that the benefits related to ATG for reducing DGF prevalence may be higher and more consistently recognized if only patients with high DGF risk are considered. We recently proposed a scoring system entitled DGFS (Delayed Graft Function Score) for such stratification of kidney transplant recipients according to their risk of DGF. Using the DGFS calculation, we aim to determine whether a short course of ATG can decrease the incidence of DGF in comparison with Basiliximab in kidney transplant recipients with low immunological risk but high DGF risk.\nMETHODS: We conduct a phase IV, open label, randomized, multicentric and prospective study, to compare ATG in parallel with a control group treated by Basiliximab. The 1:1 randomized allocation of patients between groups is stratified on the clinical center, and on the hypothermic machine-perfusion device. We aimed to include a total of 384 patients to achieve a statistical power at 0.80. The study was initiated at the Nantes University hospital in July 2014, with data collection continuing until April 2018, and publication of the results proposed for 2019.\nDISCUSSION: The main expected benefits of this study are i) the reduction of unjustified ATG over-prescriptions associated with serious adverse events, ii) the reduction of chance losses related to ATG under-prescription, iii) the decrease in the incidence of DGF which was described as a risk factor of graft failure and patient death, and iv) the reduction in hospitalization duration and number of post transplantation dialysis sessions, both being associated with reduced medical costs. In conclusion, the current study is innovative by proposing a more efficient and personalized induction therapy.\nTRIAL REGISTRATION: The study was registered in the Clinical Trials Registry (# NCT02056938, February 5, 2014), and in the European Clinical Trials Database (EudraCT #2014-000332-42, January 30, 2014).",

        "Abstract":"BACKGROUND: Chronic kidney disease (CKD) is associated with increased rates of adverse events after percutaneous coronary intervention. We sought to determine the impact of CKD on platelet reactivity in clopidogrel-treated patients and whether high platelet reactivity (HPR) confers a similar or differential risk for adverse events among patients with CKD and non-CKD.\nMETHODS AND RESULTS: We performed a post hoc analysis of the Assessment of Dual Antiplatelet Therapy With Drug-Eluting Stents (ADAPT-DES) registry, which included 8582 patients undergoing percutaneous coronary intervention with drug-eluting stents and platelet function testing using the VerifyNow assay. We compared HPR and its impact on ischemic and bleeding events >2 years among patients with CKD and non-CKD. Patients with CKD (n=1367) were older, more often female, diabetic, and had lower ejection fraction compared with their non-CKD counterparts (n=7043). Although HPR prevalence increased with worsening renal function in unadjusted analyses, these associations were no longer present after adjustment. Major adverse cardiac event rates at 2 years among those without CKD or HPR, HPR alone, CKD alone, and both CKD and HPR were 9.0%, 11.2%, 13.3%, and 17.5%, respectively (P<0.001). Associations between HPR and adverse events were uniform across CKD strata without evidence of interaction.\nCONCLUSIONS: HPR is more common among those with versus without CKD, an association that is attributable to confounding risk factors that are more prevalent in CKD. The impact of HPR on ischemic and bleeding events is similar irrespective of CKD status.\nCLINICAL TRIAL REGISTRATION: URL: http:\/\/www.clinicaltrials.gov. Unique identifier: NCT00638794.",

        "Abstract":"BACKGROUND: We conducted a prospective randomized trial to assess the protective effect of continuous intravenous infusion of nicorandil against contrast-induced nephropathy (CIN) in patients with poor renal function.\nMETHODS AND RESULTS: We randomly assigned 213 patients who would subsequently undergo elective percutaneous coronary intervention (PCI) and who had a high serum cystatin C level to a saline group (n=107) or a nicorandil group (n=106, nicorandil infused in addition to saline for 4h before and 24h after PCI). There were no significant differences in baseline characteristics between the two groups. However, the average percent increases in serum creatinine and cystatin C following PCI were significantly smaller in the nicorandil group than the saline group. Likewise, the average percent decline in the estimated glomerular filtration rate was smaller in the nicorandil group. Correspondingly, the incidence of CIN was dramatically lower in the nicorandil group than the saline group (2.0% vs. 10.7%, p<0.02).

        "Published":null,
        "Abstract":"BACKGROUND: Calcineurin inhibitors (CNIs) are the cornerstones of immunosuppressive management in renal allograft recipients even though their nephrotoxicity may contribute to a reduced long-term graft survival. This has created a great interest in improving immunosuppressive strategies in the early post-transplantation period. Proliferation signal inhibitors (PSIs), such as everolimus, are promising alternatives, although their side effects may have a drawback in de novo renal transplant recipients, for instance, delaying renal function in the presence of renal ischemia\/acute tubular necrosis and predisposing to lymphocele development.\nSTUDY AND METHODS: A retrospective study was developed to compare the combined therapy of low-dose tacrolimus and everolimus (study group) with mycophenolate mofetil\/mycophenolic acid and standard-dose tacrolimus (control group) in the first 3 months post-transplantation. The study's end-points concerned renal graft function, proteinuria, incidence of biopsy-proven acute rejection, surgical complication rates, and incidence of new-onset diabetes after renal transplantation.\nRESULTS: There was no more delayed graft function in the study group and graft function distribution was similar between groups. Median serum creatinine and eGFR were comparable as well as proteinuria levels. Generally, adverse events were rare in both groups and there were no significant statistical differences between them in terms of biopsy-proven acute rejection, surgical complication, and new-onset diabetes after renal transplantation rates.\nCONCLUSION: Despite the slightly lower tendency for serum creatinine in the study group, renal allograft function wasn't statistically different between groups. Moreover, there weren't more metabolic or surgical complications in the study group. Everolimus may be a choice in tacrolimus-sparing strategies, but a larger study and a longer follow-up are still required.",

        "Abstract":"Chronic kidney disease (CKD) is an important risk factor for coronary artery disease (CAD) and cardiovascular events. Cystatin C (CysC) has been proposed as a sensitive marker for CKD. However, the predictive value of CysC for cardiovascular events in CAD patients with preserved estimated glomerular filtration rate (eGFR) is unclear. We enrolled 277 consecutive patients undergoing elective percutaneous coronary intervention with sirolimus-eluting stents (SES). Patients with an eGFR ≤60 ml\/min\/1.73 m(2) were excluded. Serum CysC levels were measured immediately before SES implantation. Major adverse cardiac and cerebrovascular events (MACCE) were defined as cardiovascular death, acute coronary syndrome, stroke, and hospitalization because of congestive heart failure. After a median follow-up of 63 months, 29 patients had MACCE. The subjects were divided into 2 groups based on median serum CysC levels and eGFR (0.637 mg\/L and 72.43 ml\/min\/1.73 m(2), respectively). Kaplan-Meier curves showed that the high CysC group had a significantly higher occurrence of MACCE than the low CysC group (p = 0.006), although a low level of eGFR was not significantly associated with an increased risk for occurrence of MACCE. Multivariate analysis revealed that serum CysC levels were an independent predictor of MACCE [hazards ratio: 1.30 per 0.1 mg\/L (1.01-1.63), p = 0.038].

A starting dose of 1500 mg cefuroxime was given with anesthesia induction, followed by 750 mg cefuroxime every hour until wound closure. In case of renal failure the dosing regimen was adapted. Serial blood samples were collected before, during and after the CPB process. Pharmacokinetic modelling was performed by using an 'iterative two-stage Bayesian population procedure'.\nMAIN OUTCOME MEASURE: Unbound plasma concentrations of cefuroxime.\nRESULTS: 22 patients were included, data could be evaluated of 21 patients. In 24 % of the patients the unbound cefuroxime plasma concentration was below the target range during surgery before CPB started. Patients with a bodyweight above 100 kg or age <60 years were more likely to have unbound plasma concentrations below the target range (P = 0.030 and P = 0.008). During CPB, the half-life of unbound cefuroxime increased by 17 % and the clearance decreased by 11 % compared to before CPB (P = 0.033 and P = 0.014). The mean pharmacokinetic parameters before, during and after CPB were as follows: elimination half-life 72, 84 and 76 min; clearance of unbound cefuroxime (Clu) 14.2, 12.7, 13.8 l\/h and volume of distribution (Vu) 0.280, 0.284 and 0.290 l\/kg respectively. Variations in unbound fractions before, during and after CPB were below 2 %, implicating the unbound fraction of cefuroxime is not influenced by CPB.\nCONCLUSION: Our results show that CPB during CABG surgery does not lead to inadequate unbound cefuroxime concentrations.

        "Abstract":"Contrast-induced nephropathy (CIN) is one of the major causes of hospital-acquired acute renal failure. The pathophysiological mechanism of CIN remains unknown. There has been little evidence regarding the effects of Traditional Chinese Medicine (TCM) on CIN. Cordyceps sinensis (CS), a traditional Chinese herb, has been widely used clinically for the prevention of the progression of renal failure. We performed a prospective, randomized controlled trial to investigate the role of CS in the prevention of CIN in patients with acute coronary syndrome (ACS) undergoing elective percutaneous coronary intervention (PCI). The 150 ACS patients were randomly assigned to three groups, basic treatment group (n=51), standard CS therapy group (n=49, corbrin capsule 2 g, 3 times\/d were used 3 days before and after angiography), and intensive CS therapy group (n=50, corbrin capsule 3 g, 3 times\/d were used 3 days before and after angiography). Renal function was assessed at the time of hospital admission and on days 1, 2, and 3 after PCI. CIN occurred in 13 of 150 patients (8.67%). The incidence of CIN was lower in the CS treatment groups than in the basic treatment group (P<0.05), and a significant decrease in the incidence of CIN in the intensive CS therapy group was shown (P<0.01). In conclusion, prophylactic treatment with CS during the peri-procedural stage in ACS patients undergoing elective PCI has a preventive role against CIN, and intensive CS therapy could be more effective.",

Radio contrast agents can cause a reduction in renal function that may be related to oxidative stress underlining various patho- physiologies. Conflicting evidence suggests that administration of allopurinol, a xanthine oxidase inhibitor can prevent CIN.\nMATERIALS AND METHODS: This is a study of 500 patients undergoing angiography and coronary revascularisation in patients showing significant coronary block. The angiography positive patients (275) were prospectively randomised to different treatment protocol to study for their reno-protective effect. The patients received either of the three drugs saline hydration (SH, 1ml\/kg\/hr), n-acetylcysteine (SH+NAC, 600 mg bd) or Allopurinol (SH+ALLP, 300 mg\/day) 12 hours before and after administration of radio contrast agent. Levels of serum creatinine and blood urea of the 275 patients recorded at 24 hour interval were noted post angioplasty over a course of 5 days in patients receiving either omnipaque (125) or visipaque (150) contrast media. All the 500 patients were also assessed for development of any kind of adverse drug effects\/reactions with the two contrast media.\nRESULTS: CIN occurred in 56 of 500 the patients (10.6%) who underwent angiography and 49 of 275 patients (17.8%) who underwent angioplasty. In the omnipaque group CIN occurred in 16\/40, 8\/40, nil\/45 in patients receiving SH, NAC plus SH and SH plus ALLP respectively. In the visipaque group CIN occurred in 15\/50, 10\/50, nil\/50 in the three treatments groups respectively. Allopurinol maintained a consistent fall in the serum creatinine & blood urea levels from the baseline values from the end of the 1(st) day (p < .01 & .001) in both the category. Visipaque proved to be better dye than omnipaque with less adverse drug effects\/ reactions.\nCONCLUSION: Prophylactic oral administration of allopurinol (300 mg\/day) along with hydration is better than n-acetylcysteine and saline hydration alone for protection against CIN in patients undergoing coronary procedures.",

        "Abstract":"This study aims to investigate the effect of recombinant human brain natriuretic peptide (rhBNP) on renal function and contrast-induced nephropathy (CIN) incidence in ST-segment elevation myocardial infarction and heart failure (STEMI-HF) patients with mild renal insufficiency undergoing primary percutaneous coronary intervention (PCI). A total of 116 participants were randomized into rhBNP (rhBNP, n = 57) and nitroglycerin group (NIT, n = 59), receiving intravenous rhBNP or nitroglycerin from admission to 72 h after PCI. Renal function was assessed by serum creatinine (SCr), estimated glomerular filtration rate (eGFR), Cystatin-C (Cys-C) and β2-microglobulin before and after primary PCI, and calculated the incidence of CIN within 72 h after PCI. There were no significant differences in SCr, eGFR and β2-microglobulin between the two groups (P > 0.05, respectively). Compared with the NIT group, the total urinary volume within 72 h was higher while the level of Cys-C at 24 and 72 h after PCI was lower in the rhBNP group. rhBNP was associated with a decline in the incidence of CIN (12.28 vs. 28.81 %, P < 0.05). No differences were detected in mortality and re-hospitalization in 3 months between the two groups. The incidence of renal injury was not different between rhBNP and nitroglycerin in STEMI-HF patients with mild renal insufficiency. However, infusion of rhBNP was associated with a decline in incidence of CIN.",

A total of 2,106 (20.6%) patients were women. Women were older (72.7±9.7 vs 66.6±10.8 years, p<0.001), and had a lower body mass index (23.4±4.0 vs 24.3±3.5, p<0.001), with a higher prevalence of hypertension (p<0.001), hyperlipidemia (p<0.001), insulin-dependent diabetes (p<0.001), renal failure (p<0.001), and heart failure (p<0.001) compared with men. Men tended to have more bifurcation lesions (p = 0.003) and chronic totally occluded lesions (p<0.001) than women. Crude overall complications (14.8% vs 9.5%, p<0.001) and the rate of bleeding complications (5.3% vs 2.8%, p<0.001) were significantly higher in women than in men. On multivariate analysis in the total cohort, female sex was an independent predictor of overall complications (OR, 1.47; 95% CI, 1.26-1.71; p<0.001) and bleeding complications (OR, 1.74; 95% CI, 1.36-2.24; p<0.001) after adjustment for confounding variables.

        "Abstract":"BACKGROUND\/AIMS: In renal transplantation, peri-operative low-dose rabbit-antithymocyte-globulin (RATG) plus basiliximab induction prevented acute allograft rejection more effectively than post-operative RATG plus basiliximab induction. We investigated the specific antirejection contribution of basiliximab in this context.\nMETHODS: This single-center, observational, matched-cohort study evaluated allograft rejections (primary outcome), steroid exposure and side effects, GFR (iohexol plasma clearance) and treatment costs in 16 deceased-donor renal transplant recipients induced with RATG (0.5 mg\/kg\/day) and 32 age-, gender- and treatment-matched reference-patients given RATG plus basiliximab (20 mg on days 0 and 4).\nRESULTS: Induction was well tolerated. At 18 months, 8 patients (50%) vs. 3 reference-patients (9.4%) rejected the graft [HR (95% CI): 6.53 (1.73-24.70), p = 0.006]. Difference was significant (p < 0.01) even after adjusting for recipient\/donor age and gender, cold ischemia time and HLA mismatches. There were 1 antibody-mediated rejection and 2 moderate cellular rejections in patients vs. none in reference-patients (p = 0.032). The median (interquartile range) prednisone cumulative dose was remarkably higher in patients than reference-patients [4.78 (1.12-6.10) vs. 0.19 (0.18-3.81) grams, p = 0.002]. Three patients vs. 24 reference-patients were off-steroid at study end (p < 0.001). Three patients vs. no reference-patient developed new-onset diabetes (p = 0.003). Both inductions similarly depleted B-cells. Outcomes of AZA- vs. MMF-treated participants were similar. GFR was similar in all groups. Compared to MMF, AZA therapy saved ≈ EUR 2,500\/year and by month 14.3 post-transplant compensated basiliximab costs.\nCONCLUSION: In renal transplantation, basiliximab plus peri-operative low-dose RATG more efficiently prevented allograft rejection than RATG monotherapy, and minimized steroid exposure and toxicity.

        "Abstract":"BACKGROUND: Antibody-mediated rejection (AMR) is a severe form of rejection, mediated primarily by antibody-dependent complement (C) activation. C1 inhibitor (C1-INH, Berinert) inhibits the classical and lectin pathways of C activation. We performed a randomized, placebo-controlled study using C1-INH in highly sensitized renal transplant recipients for prevention of AMR.\nMETHODS: Twenty highly sensitized patients desensitized with IVIG+rituximab±plasma exchange were enrolled and randomized 1:1 to receive plasma-derived human C1-INH (20 IU\/kg\/dose) versus placebo intraoperatively, then twice weekly for 7 doses. Renal function, adverse events (AEs)\/serious AEs, C3, C4, and C1-INH levels were monitored and C1q+ HLA antibodies were also blindly assessed.\nRESULTS: One patient in the C1-INH group versus 2 patients in the placebo group developed serious AEs, but none were related to study drug. Delayed graft function developed in 1 C1-INH subject and 4 in the placebo. The C1-INH trough levels increased with C1-INH treatment. C3 and C4 levels also increased significantly in the C1-INH group compared to placebo. No C1-INH patient developed AMR during the study. Two patients developed AMR after the study. Three placebo patients developed AMR, one during the study. C1q+ donor specific antibodies were reduced in 2 C1-INH treated patients tested, while immunoglobulin G DSA levels showed decreased binding for both groups.\nCONCLUSIONS: The C1-INH appears safe in the posttransplant period. The C1-INH treatment may reduce ischemia-reperfusion injury. The C1-INH also resulted in significant elevations of C1-INH levels, C3, C4, and reduced C1q+ HLA antibodies. Taken together, the combination of antibody reduction and C1-INH may prove useful in prevention of AMR. Further controlled studies are warranted.",

        "Abstract":"INTRODUCTION: Delayed graft function (DGF) is a consequence of ischemia-reperfusion injuries in kidney allografts, for which no definite treatment is available. The neutrophil gelatinase-associated lipocalin (NGAL) and interleukin-18 (IL-18) are introduced as the most promising urine biomarkers to detect DGF. N-acetylcysteine (NAC) and vitamin C, well-known potent antioxidants that scavenge free radicals, may alleviate kidney injury. This study investigated the protective effects of NAC alone and in combination with vitamin C on DGF, by measuring IL-18 and NGAL in living donor kidney transplantations.\nMATERIALS AND METHODS: Patients transplanted between January 2011 and February 2013 were randomly divided into 3 groups to receive routine anti-rejection medication only (n = 32), NAC plus routine immunosuppressive regimen (NAC group; n = 33), and NAC and vitamin C plus routine regimen (NAC and vitamin C group; n = 19). Urine samples were taken 4 hours and 24 hours after transplantation. Enzyme-linked immunosorbent assay kits were utilized for measuring urine NGAL and IL-18.\nRESULTS: There were no significant differences in the DGF prevalence and its duration between the study arms. Although the levels of NGAL and IL-18 decreased in the NAC and NAC and vitamin C groups, these reductions were not significant. Glomerular filtration rate at 30 and 60 days after transplantation were not significantly different between study groups, either.\nCONCLUSIONS: Our results showed that NAC is a safe drug without significant adverse effects in kidney transplant recipients; however, its potential useful effects on urinary biomarkers of DGF were not illustrated in the present study.",

Chronic kidney disease was defined as creatinine clearance <60 mL\/min. A total of 1786 propensity-matched patients from 4006 patients with chronic kidney disease undergoing index revascularization for multivessel disease with either DES or isolated CABG (n=893 each group) were analyzed. Baseline and procedural characteristics between percutaneous coronary intervention and CABG groups were well-balanced, including urgent revascularization priority, diabetes mellitus, left ventricular function, and 3-vessel disease. The 1-, 2-, and 3-year Kaplan-Meier survival analyses in propensity-matched patients favored CABG (93.2% versus 89.3%; 86.6% versus 80.3%; 80.8% versus 71.5%, respectively; P<0.001).

This is a multicenter registry comparing results of 290 patients (186 with normal kidney function, 104 on dialysis) who underwent PCI with exclusive use of paclitaxel-eluting TAXUS stent. The primary endpoint was an assessment of major adverse cardiac events (MACE) at 1- and 2-year observation. Mean follow-up was 23.3 ± 6.1 months. Results at 12 months showed: MACE 11.8% vs. 7.7% (P = not significant [ns]), composite major adverse cardiac and cerebrovascular events (MACCE) 12.4% vs. 11.5% (P = ns), all-cause death 2.7% vs. 8.6% (P < 0.05), cardiac death 2.7% vs. 1.9% (P = ns), target vessel revascularization (TVR) 9.1% vs. 6.7% (P = ns), acute myocardial infarction (AMI) 3.8% vs. 2.9% (P = ns), cerebrovascular events (CVA) 0.5% vs. 1.0% (P = ns); and results at 24 months showed: MACE 17.7% vs. 18.3% (P = ns), MACCE 21.5% vs. 26.0% (P = ns), all-cause death 4.3% vs. 14.4% (P < 0.01), cardiac death 3.2% vs. 1.9% (P = ns), TVR 14.0% vs. 16.3% (P = ns), AMI 5.4% vs. 5.8% (P = ns), CVA 3.2% vs. 2.9% (P = ns) for non-end-stage renal disease (ESRD) and dialysis group, respectively. Prior coronary artery bypass graft (CABG) was found to be single risk factor for MACE, TVR, and MACCE in patients with ESRD, while dialysis and prior CABG were found to be single risk factors for death in the entire population.

        "Abstract":"BACKGROUND: Contrast-induced acute kidney injury (CI-AKI) is an adverse consequence of percutaneous coronary interventions which results in significant morbidity and mortality and adds to the costs of diagnostic and interventional cardiology procedures. Various pathophysiological mechanisms have been proposed for CI-AKI and various agents tested for its prevention. There is currently a general agreement that adequate pre-procedural hydration constitutes the cornerstone of prevention, yet there are reports of the use of some other agents with various efficacies. We prospectively tested IV magnesium sulfate (Mg) for CI-AKI prevention.\nMETHOD AND DESIGN: This study is a prospective, randomized, open-labeled, single-center clinical trial. We randomly assigned 122 consecutive patients to two groups. The first group was the control group with routine treatment (n = 64), and second group was the study group with routine treatment plus IV magnesium sulfate 1 g just before the procedure (n = 62). Serum creatinine was measured before the procedure and 2 days after the procedure. The primary end point was the occurrence of CI-AKI within 48 h. CI-AKI was defined as 0.5 mg\/dl or more increase in serum creatinine or 25% or more increase above baseline serum creatinine. There was no difference in definition if both of these parameters were present.\nRESULTS: The control and study groups were comparable in the overall predicted risk of CI-AKI. Also, the type and volume of the contrast were not significantly different between the two groups. Following angioplasty, CI-AKI occurred in 17 (26.6%) patients in the control group and nine (14.5%) patients in the study group; there was a significant reduction in CI-AKI in the study group (P = 0.01). Additionally, there was no mortality or a need for hemodialysis in either group.\nCONCLUSION: In primary PCI patients, the prophylactic use of intravenous Mg can be recommended to be added to traditional hydration for CI-AKI prevention.",

        "Published":"2014-11-29",
        "Abstract":"BACKGROUND CONTEXT: With a significant increase in the number and complexity of spinal deformity corrective surgeries, blood loss, often requiring massive intraoperative transfusions, becomes a major limiting factor during surgery. This scenario is particularly during posterior vertebral column resection (PVCR), where extensive intraoperative blood loss may pose a major risk to the patient, preventing smooth execution of the procedure. Tranexamic Acid (TXA) has been used in cardiac and orthopedic surgeries, including major spinal surgeries, to reduce blood loss and transfusion requirements for decades.\nPURPOSE: To assess the efficacy and safety of high doses of TXA in posterior spinal deformity corrective surgery, including PVCR procedures.\nSTUDY DESIGN: A retrospective study from a single institution.\nPATIENT SAMPLE: Fifty-nine patients (age range 7 to 46 years old) with spinal deformities undergoing spinal corrective surgeries were included. The patients were divided into two groups: the TXA group (total of 26 patients, including 8 PVCR patients) and the control group (total of 33 patients, including 9 PVCR patients).\nOUTCOME MEASURES: The analyzed outcome measures included estimated intraoperative blood loss, real blood loss (RBL; blood loss\/blood volume×100%), blood transfusion requirements, coagulation parameters, complete blood count, liver function, and renal function. Lower limb vein thrombus, symptomatic pulmonary embolism, symptomatic myocardial infarction, seizures, and acute renal failure were also recorded.\nMETHODS: Before skin incision, the patients in the TXA group received an intravenous loading dose of 100 mg\/Kg over a 20-minute period, followed by a maintenance infusion of 10 mg\/Kg\/h until skin closure was completed. The patients in the control group received saline infusion of a similar volume. Statistics included estimated intraoperative blood loss, RBL, blood transfusion requirements, coagulation parameters, complete blood count, liver function, and renal function. All patients in this study were also carefully monitored for consciousness level, breathing status, chest tightness or pain, and urine output after surgery. These were done to detect the presence or absence of pulmonary embolism, myocardial infarction, seizures, and acute renal failure. Patients treated with TXA were examined via vascular ultrasound before and after surgery.\nRESULTS: There were no significant differences in the demographic or surgical traits between the two groups. The blood loss of the patients in the TXA group was 2,441±1,666 mL, whereas that of the control group patients was 4,789±4,719 mL. The difference was statistically significant (p<.05). The average RBL of the patients in the TXA group was 80.6%±49.6% versus 160.8%±163.1% in the control group (p<.05). The blood transfusion requirements for the patients in the TXA group were significantly less than that in the control group (p<.05). Blood loss, RBL, and blood transfusion requirements were all significantly lower in the TXA group, compared with the control group among both PVCR patients and non-PVCR patients. In the TXA group, there was an average of 57.4% reduced blood loss in patients who received PVCR and 39.8% in patients not receiving PVCR. There were no differences in liver and renal functions between the TXA and control groups. There was no lower limb vein thrombus, symptomatic myocardial infarction, symptomatic pulmonary embolism, seizures, or acute renal failure reported in the TXA group.\nCONCLUSIONS: In our study, high doses of TXA have been shown to effectively control blood loss and reduce the transfusion requirement. This effect was more apparent in patients receiving PVCR. No adverse drug reaction was recorded in the study. In the future, prospective randomized controlled trials to validate our results will be necessary. Future studies conducted on older patient cohort may also be necessary to confirm the safety of extending the use of TXA to the older patients.",

        "Abstract":"There have been attempts to find new approaches to the treatment of multivessel coronary artery disease without increasing adverse events. Deployment of drug-eluting stents (DES) for complex lesions and bare-metal stents (BMS) for simpler lesions, although already in wide use, has not been well supported by clinical study. A cohort of 1,658 patients who underwent multivessel percutaneous coronary intervention from March 2003 through June 2011 was studied for 1 year. These patients were divided into 3 groups: BMS only (599 patients); DES only (481 patients); and hybrid stenting (578 patients). Baseline characteristics were similar except for hyperlipidemia and moderate-to-severe mitral regurgitation, which were more frequent in the DES and hybrid groups, respectively. Lesion characteristics were more complex in the DES group, compared with the other groups: more B2\/C type lesions, longer stents, and smaller reference-vessel diameters (P <0.001). The rates of major adverse cardiac events (MACE) at 1 year were similar between the groups (BMS=5.2%, hybrid=3.9%, and DES=3.4%; P=0.248). Subgroup analysis yielded no differences in death, nonfatal myocardial infarction, target-vessel revascularization, or target-lesion revascularization. On multivariable analysis, the strongest predictors of 1-year MACE were percutaneous intervention complicated by dissection, renal failure, left ventricular ejection fraction below 0.40, mean lesion length, reference vessel diameter, and percutaneous intervention on the left circumflex coronary artery. The latter two had inverse relationships with MACE. In conclusion, implanting the DES for more complex lesions and the BMS for simpler lesions seems more sensible than the exclusive use of the DES or the BMS.",

        "Abstract":"BACKGROUND: Several animal studies suggest beneficial effects on kidney function upon administration of levosimendan. As recent data from clinical studies are heterogeneous, we sought to investigate whether levosimendan is associated with improved postoperative kidney function in cardiac surgery patients with respect to timing of its administration.\nMETHODS: Retrospective, single centre, observational analysis at a university hospital in Berlin, Germany. All adult patients without preoperative renal dysfunction that underwent coronary artery bypass grafting and\/or valve reconstruction\/replacement between 01\/01\/2007 and 31\/12\/2011 were considered for analyses.\nRESULTS: Out of 1.095 included patients, 46 patients were treated with levosimendan due to a severely reduced left ventricular systolic function preoperatively (LVEF < 35%) and\/or clinical signs of a low cardiac output syndrome. Sixty-one percent received the drug whilst in the OR, 39% after postoperative intensive care unit admission. When levosimendan was given immediately after anaesthesia induction, creatinine plasma levels (p = 0.009 for nonparametric analysis of longitudinal data in a two-factorial design) and incidence of postoperative renal dysfunction (67.9% vs. 94.4%; p = 0.033) were significantly reduced in contrast to a later start of treatment. In addition, duration of renal replacement therapy was significantly shorter (79 [35;332] vs. 272 [132;703] minutes; p = 0.046) in that group.\nCONCLUSIONS: Postoperative kidney dysfunction is a common condition in patients under going cardiac surgery. Patients with severely reduced left ventricular function and\/or clinical signs of a low cardiac output syndrome who preoperatively presented with a normal kidney function may benefit from an early start of levosimendan administration, i.e. immediately after anaesthesia.\nTRIAL REGISTRATION: Clinicaltrials.gov-ID: NCT01918618 .",

        "Published":"2014-11-12",
        "Abstract":"OBJECTIVES: Acute kidney failure after coronary artery bypass grafting (CABG) is a serious complication that increases morbidity and mortality rates. Early detection and prevention of this complication are very important. A novel biomarker named neutrophil gelatinase-associated lipocalin (NGAL) can play an important role in early diagnosis of acute kidney injury. Recent studies on the favourable effects of Dexmedetomidine on cardiac surgery have been published. The aim of this study is to investigate whether there is a dose-dependent positive effect of Dexmedetomidine on neutrophil gelatinase-associated lipocalin levels and renal functions when used after CABG.\nMETHODS: Our randomized, triple-blinded, placebo-controlled study was conducted among 295 patients scheduled for CABG surgery between August 2009 and March 2011 in a tertiary cardiac and vascular surgery clinic. A total of 90 consecutive patients who met inclusion criteria were randomized and divided into three groups. The first group received a placebo. The second and the third groups received 4 and 8 µg\/cc concentration of the Dexmedetomidine infusion, respectively. Infusion rates were regulated to obtain sedation with a Ramsey sedation score of 2 or 3. Patients were regrouped according to the total Dexmedetomidine dose. Statistical analyses of variables including serum neutrophil gelatinase-associated lipocalin values and conventional renal function tests were made for all six possibilities before the blind was broken.\nRESULTS: Results of conventional renal function tests were not significantly different. However, neutrophil gelatinase-associated lipocalin levels for the first postoperative day for placebo, low-dose and high-dose Dexmedetomidine groups were 176.8 ± 145.9, 97.7 ± 63.4 and 67.3 ± 10.9 ng\/ml, respectively. These values were significantly different among the groups (P <0.001).\nCONCLUSIONS: In our study, we found that Dexmedetomidine infusion for sedation after CABG under cardiopulmonary bypass can be useful in the prevention of kidney injury. Conventional renal function tests, including blood urea nitrogen, serum creatinine, urine output and creatinine clearance rate measurements typically may not detect the development of acute kidney dysfunction in the first 48-h postoperative period. Differences were detected in renal function in the early postoperative period and the development of acute kidney injury, as determined by measurements of blood NGAL levels, was significant and dose-dependent.",

He reported no chest symptom and did not exhibit any established risk factors for coronary artery disease, such as diabetes, obesity, hypertension or relevant family history, with the exception of current smoking, on admission. A stress electrocardiogram showed negative findings. The left adrenal tumor as well as left kidney, spleen and distal portion of the pancreas were subsequently resected using radical surgery. The histopathological findings confirmed the preoperative diagnosis of adrenocortical carcinoma. After the operation, treatment with low-dose mitotane (1g\/day) was introduced as adjuvant chemotherapy. Interestingly, the patient developed marked hyper-LDL cholesterolemia at a level equivalent to that of familial hypercholesterolemia (LDL cholesterol level ~ 300 mg\/dL) following the introduction of mitotane, without evidence of primary or secondary hypercholesterolemia due to other causes. A coronary angiogram performed to assess the new-onset angina revealed three-vessel disease, which was later revascularized via percutaneous coronary intervention eight months after the start of mitotane therapy. The cholesterol level normalized with the suspension of mitotane. This case suggests that mitotane can cause severe hypercholesterolemia, potentially resulting in coronary atherosclerosis.",

        "Abstract":"BACKGROUND: Cyclosporine and tacrolimus (TAC) are the most potent immunosuppressants. TAC is considered less nephrotoxic, but may be an important factor in chronic graft dysfunction. The aim of the study was to evaluate kidney function and cardiovascular risk profile in 2 groups of low immunological risk kidney allograft recipients receiving 2 TAC dosages.\nMATERIALS AND METHODS: Patients were randomly assigned to 2 TAC-based treatments (group I [n = 14], standard dose; group II [n = 15], reduced dose). Patient and graft survival, graft function, occurrence of cardiovascular events (cardiac death, myocardial infarction, stroke), incidence of new-onset diabetes mellitus after transplantation, and cardiovascular risk factors were assessed over a 5-year period.\nRESULTS: Patient demographics and transplant characteristics were not statistically different between groups. TAC trough levels were significantly higher in group I for 24 months post transplant. Patient survival did not differ, but there were more acute rejection episodes and graft losses in group II. There were no significant differences in the rate of cardiac events. Graft function measured as serum creatinine levels and calculated glomerular filtration rate did not differ between groups. The same applies to new-onset diabetes mellitus after transplantation incidence. Office blood pressures were numerically higher in group I up to 24 months but this difference did not reach significance at any time. Similar results were obtained for serum lipids.\nCONCLUSIONS: Immunosuppression based on low doses of tacrolimus seems to be safe in the group of low immunological risk patients but in the 60-month follow-up does not offer any clear benefits in terms of potential nephrotoxicity or cardiovascular risk.",

        "Abstract":"Drug-eluting stents (DES) were first used on-label - in simple patients with low clinical risk and easily accessible lesions. Currently, DES are increasingly used off-label - in complex patients undergoing percutaneous coronary interventions (PCI) with historically higher event risk. Therefore, our aim was to investigate whether patients with off-label indications for DES use had similar outcomes compared to patients who were treated for on-label indications only. We analysed two-year follow-up data of 1,387 TWENTE trial patients, treated with second-generation everolimus-eluting XIENCE V or zotarolimus-eluting Resolute stents, and compared off-label vs. on-label DES use with regard to the following clinical endpoints: cardiac death, myocardial infarction (MI), periprocedural MI (≤48 hrs), and target vessel revascularisation (TVR). Patients with off-label DES use (n=1,033; 74.5%) had more diabetes (22.9% vs. 17.5%; p=0.032), previous MI (35.9% vs. 22.3%; p<0.001), type B2\/C lesions (84.7% vs. 62.7%; p<0.001), and acute coronary syndromes (57.8% vs. 33.3%; p<0.001). Nevertheless, cardiac death and TVR rates were similar to those of patients with on-label DES use (p>0.8). Following off-label DES use, there was a higher incidence of PMI (5.0% vs. 1.4%; p=0.003), of which only 1.1% reached creatine kinase levels >5x the upper limit of normal (ULN). Despite differences in risk profile, patients with off-label DES use did not differ from patients with on-label DES use in clinical endpoints other than periprocedural MI. These largely positive findings underline the favourable safety profile of second-generation DES.",

We searched the PubMed, EMBASE, Cochrane Library, Wanfang database, China National Knowledge Infrastructure, and VIP database through April 2014. Only randomized controlled trials (RCTs) comparing short-term high-dose atorvastatin with low-dose atorvastatin on CI-AKI were selected. The main outcomes were the change of acute kidney injury markers and the incidence of contrast-induced nephropathy (CIN). We combined 14 RCTs consisting of 1,689 patients. Compared with the low-dose atorvastatin, high-dose atorvastatin treatment was associated with a reduction in serum creatinine levels (weighted mean differences [WMD]-0.1 mg\/dL; 95%CI -0.14 to -0.05). In addition, high-dose atorvastatin treatment was also associated with a lower incidence of CIN (risk ratios 0.41; 95%CI 0.29-0.56).

        "Abstract":"PURPOSE: Nephron-sparing surgery (NSS) is the gold standard treatment for resectable renal tumors. In the last decade, laparoscopic partial nephrectomy (LPN) has evolved in technical, surgical and oncological aspects and is an accepted treatment option for local-stage renal tumors. Improvements in not only surgical techniques, but also potent hemostats have encouraged this evolution. Here, we report our initial experiences with a new hemostatic agent, Hemopatch(®) (polyethylene glycol-coated collagen patch, Baxter), in zero-ischemia LPN.\nMETHODS: Seven patients with confirmed renal masses were enrolled and subjected to zero-ischemia LPN. In all cases, Hemopatch(®) was applied to the tumor resection site after suturing of the renal parenchyma. The following clinical data were captured for analysis: staging information, PADUA and RENAL nephrometry scores, operation time, blood loss, complications, pathology and hospitalization length.\nRESULTS: The median tumor size was 30.0 mm (range 9.5-72). The median PADUA and RENAL nephrometry scores were 6 (range 6-7) and 4 (range 4-6), respectively. All LPNs were performed with the zero-ischemia technique. In six of the seven patients, parenchymal suturing of the resection site was performed. No uncontrolled bleeding was observed. The median operation duration was 139 min (range 103-194), the median blood loss was 325 cc (range 50-700) and the median hospitalization length was 6 days (range 4-7). Hemopatch(®) provided sufficient hemostasis in all cases. No postoperative complications were observed.\nCONCLUSIONS: Although this study is limited to a small set of initial experiences with Hemopatch(®) in LPN, it proves the feasibility and reliability of this new hemostat. Following further evaluation in prospective randomized comparative studies, Hemopatch(®) might represent a promising tool in NSS.",

There have been 2 randomized controlled trials comparing everolimus-eluting stents (EESs) and Resolute zotarolimus-eluting stents (ZES-Rs). To date, long-term clinical outcomes of these stents were limited to only 1 report, which has recently reported 4-year comparisons of these stents. Therefore, more evidence is needed regarding long-term clinical outcomes of the second-generation stents. This study compared the long-term clinical outcomes of EES with ZES-R in \"all-comer\" cohorts up to 3-year follow-up. The EXCELLENT and RESOLUTE-Korea registries prospectively enrolled 3,056 patients treated with EES and 1,998 with ZES-R, respectively, without exclusions. Stent-related composite outcomes (target lesion failure) and patient-related composite events up to 3-year follow-up were compared in crude and propensity score-matched analyses. Of 5,054 patients, 3,830 patients (75.8%) had off-label indication (2,217 treated with EES and 1,613 treated with ZES-R). The stent-related outcome (189 [6.2%] vs 127 [6.4%], p = 0.812) and the patient-related outcome (420 [13.7%] vs 250 [12.5%], p = 0.581) did not differ between EES and ZES-R, respectively, at 3 years, which was corroborated by similar results from the propensity score-matched cohort (hazard ratio [HR] 0.92, 95% confidence interval [CI] 0.70 to 1.20, p = 0.523 and 0.85, 95% CI 0.70 to 1.02, p = 0.081, for stent- and patient-related outcomes, respectively). The rate of definite or probable stent thrombosis up to 3 years (22 [0.7%] vs 10 [0.5%], p = 0.370) was also similar. The rate of very late definite or probable stent thrombosis was very low and comparable between the 2 stents (3 [0.1%] vs 1 [0.1%], p = 0.657). In multivariate analysis, chronic renal failure (adjusted HR 3.615, 95% CI 2.440 to 5.354, p <0.001) and off-label indication (adjusted HR 1.782, 95% CI 1.169 to 2.718, p = 0.007) were the strongest predictors of target lesion failure at 3 years. In conclusion, both stents showed comparable safety and efficacy at 3-year follow-up in this robust real-world registry with unrestricted use of EES and ZES-R. Overall incidences of target lesion failure and definite stent thrombosis, including very late stent thrombosis, were low, even in the patients with off-label indications, suggesting excellent long-term safety and sustained efficacy of both types of second-generation drug-eluting stents.",

        "Abstract":"BACKGROUND: Atrial Fibrillation (AF) is a common complication after open heart surgery and is frequently associated with increased hospital stay, complications, and mortality rates. The effect of β-blockers on prevention of supraventricular arrhythmias has been confirmed in several prospective randomized studies.\nOBJECTIVES: This clinical trial aimed to compare the preventive effects of carvedilol and metoprolol on occurrence of AF after CABG surgery.\nPATIENTS AND METHODS: This prospective, double-blind, randomized clinical trial was conducted on 150 patients (55 females, 95 males; mean age: 59 ± 10 years) who underwent CABG surgery. The patients with no contraindication for β-blocker use were randomly divided into two groups of carvedilol and metoprolol Tartarate (n = 75). Treatment with β-blocker was started on the first postoperative day (metoprolol, 25 mg BD; carvedilol, 6.25 mg, BD) and the dosage was regulated according to the patients' hemodynamic response. All the patients were monitored 5 days after the surgery and incidence of AF and other complications was recorded in both groups.\nRESULTS: AF was detected in 18 patients in the carvedilol group and 21 patients in the metoprolol group (P = 0.577). The results of Fisher Exact test showed no significant relationship between the type of the drug and the occurrence of AF (P < 0.05). Nevertheless, the prevalence of AF was higher in the renal failure group. AF was mostly recorded on the second and third days after the surgery. The results showed an association between old age and higher occurrence of AF. AF was recorded in 11 patients (14%) in the metoprolol group and 9 ones (12%) in the carvedilol group, with Left Ventricle Ejection Fraction (LVEF) being between 35% and 45% (P = 0.587). However, no significant difference was found between the two groups in this regard.\nCONCLUSIONS: In the patients with sufficient ejection fraction, no difference was observed in using carvedilol or metoprolol in prevention of post-CABG AF. Yet, given the anti-oxidant and anti- inflammatory effects of carvedilol, it might be more beneficial in comparison to metoprolol, particularly in the patients with lower ejection fractions or heart failure.",

        "Abstract":"Administration of high intensity statins prior to percutaneous coronary intervention (PCI) for acute coronary syndrome (ACS) or stable coronary artery disease has been shown to reduce short-, mid-, and long-term cardiovascular disease (CVD) morbidity and mortality as well as overall mortality compared with lower intensity statins or no statin treatment. The mechanisms involved are probably related to the pleiotropic effects of statins. Improved endothelial function, reduced low grade inflammation and decreased thrombotic diathesis might reduce cardiac injury, diffuse cardiac necrosis, myocardial infarction and no-reflow phenomenon. A decreased risk of contrast-induced nephropathy (CIN) post-PCI might be an extracardiac mechanism that contributes to the reduction in all cause and CVD mortality. These results support the need for the administration of statins before PCI.",

However, the clinical role of high-dose statin loading in patients with acute heart failure (AHF) remains unknown.\nMETHODS AND RESULTS: In a prospective, single-center, randomized, controlled, open-label pilot study, patients hospitalized with AHF were randomly assigned to receive oral high-dose atorvastatin loading (80 mg for 3 days, followed by 10 mg\/day until discharge) or no statin therapy, on top of optimal HF treatment. The primary outcome measures were changes to the level of biomarkers related to inflammation and renal injury from admission to hospital day 4. No significant changes in the levels of NT-proBNP (-2,627±4,956 vs. -2,981±6,951 pg\/ml, P=0.845), hsCRP (-6.1±16.4 vs. -2.1±16.2 mg\/L, P=0.105), cystatin C (0.002±0.185 vs. 0.009±0.216 mg\/L, P=0.904), ACR (-886.3±1,984.9 vs. -165.6±825.2 mg\/day, P=0.124) were observed in either group.

        "Abstract":"OBJECTIVE: Thrombolysis and open surgical revascularization are current options for the treatment of acute limb ischemia (ALI). Despite the several randomized controlled trials comparing the two options, no single treatment can yet be recommended as a universal initial management of ALI. The purpose of this study was to evaluate contemporary endovascular and surgical revascularization for ALI.\nMETHODS: Consecutive patients with ALI treated with endovascular revascularization (ER) or open revascularization (OR) between 2005 and 2011 were identified and reviewed. Procedural success and outcomes were compared between the two groups. Limb salvage and survival were assessed by time-to-event methods, including Kaplan-Meier estimation and competing-risks regression models.\nRESULTS: A total of 154 limbs were treated in 147 patients in the ER group, compared with 326 limbs in 296 patients in the OR group. The mean follow-up was 14 ± 18.5 months. The majority of patients presented with Rutherford II ischemia (83% for OR, 90% for ER). In Rutherford II patients, technical success was achieved in 90.7% of the OR group vs 79.9% of the ER group (P = .002), with amputation rates of 10.0% vs 7.2% (P = .35) at 30 days and 16.3% vs 13.0% (P = .37) at 1 year, respectively. In Rutherford II patients with failed bypass graft, technical success rate was 95.0% (OR) vs 75.0% (ER) (P = .001), whereas the amputation rate was 6.3% vs 15.38% (P = .13) at 30 days and 24.1% vs 23.1% (P = .90) at 1 year, respectively. The overall 30-day mortality rate was 13.2% (OR) and 5.4% (ER) (P = .012). Overall amputation rates were 13.5% (OR) vs 6.5% (ER) at 30 days (P = .023) and 19.6% (OR) vs 13.0% (ER) at 1 year (P = .074). The primary patency rate was 57% (OR) and 51% (ER) at 1 year (P = .74). Predictors of limb loss by life-table analysis included coronary artery disease (hazard ratio [HR], 2.0; P = .007) and Rutherford category III (HR, 19.0; P < .001). Predictors of death by life-table analysis included age (HR, 1.03; P < .001), end-stage renal disease (HR, 7.28; P < .001), cancer (HR, 1.65; P = .005), and chronic obstructive pulmonary disease (HR, 1.61; P = .005).\nCONCLUSIONS: In patients presenting with class II ALI, ER or surgical OR resulted in comparable limb salvage rates. Although technical success is higher with OR for patients presenting with failed bypass grafts, the amputation rates are comparable. Overall mortality rates are significantly higher at 30 days and 1 year in the OR group.",

In the DES era, the impact of diabetes mellitus on restenosis and clinical outcomes post-SVG intervention is not clearly defined.\nMETHODS: From our institutional PCI registry database, we retrospectively analyzed 477 consecutive patients with prior coronary artery bypass graft surgery undergoing SVG PCI with the implantation of DES stratified by the presence or absence of diabetes mellitus. The primary end-point was 1-year major adverse cardiac event (MACE) rate, defined as death, Q wave myocardial infarction, and target lesion revascularization.\nRESULTS: Baseline clinical characteristics, including mean graft age (120 ± 77 vs. 131 ± 86 months, P = 0.14), were similar between groups, save for a higher prevalence of systemic hypertension and chronic renal insufficiency, and higher body mass index in the diabetic group. Among the 604 SVG lesions treated with DES, the angiographic and procedural characteristics were well matched between groups except for the higher rate of distal protection device use (32% vs. 29%, P = 0.007) in the diabetic group. The rates of 1-year MACE (21% vs. 15%, P = 0.12) and all-cause mortality (7.6% vs. 6.7%, P = 0.86) were similar between groups. After adjustment for the relevant clinical co-variables, diabetic status was not associated with the composite end-point.\nCONCLUSION: In conclusion, DES, when used for the treatment of vein graft lesions, equate the short- and long-term outcomes between diabetic and nondiabetic patients, suggesting that DES should be considered the default stent in diabetic populations undergoing PCI for the treatment of SVG lesions.",

The goal of this study was to determine the natural history of medically treated patients with ASCAS.\nMETHODS: Patients with ASCAS from 2005 to 2006 were identified in a health network database. Patients were included if the initial therapeutic plan involved medical therapy alone (usually because of comorbidities or patient preference). Study end points included: ipsilateral neurologic symptoms (INS) of transient ischemic attack and\/or stroke, death, and INS and\/or death.\nRESULTS: There were 126 carotid arteries identified in 115 patients. Using standard duplex velocity criteria, 88 (70%) had severe (70%-89%) and 38 (30%) had very severe stenoses (VSS; 90%-99%). The average age was 73.5 years, demographic characteristics included: 66% hypertension, 64% coronary artery disease, 30% diabetes, 5% chronic kidney disease (CKD), and 86% were taking a statin drug (28% had a low-density lipoprotein level <100 mg\/dL). There were 31 patients (24.6%) who developed INS during a mean follow-up of 27 months; most (23 of 31; 74%) occurred within 12 months of the initial duplex ultrasound examination; 14 (45%) were strokes. The 5-year actuarial freedom from INS was 70.1 ± 5%. Multivariate predictors of INS included: VSS (hazard ratio [HR], 3.23; 95% confidence interval [CI], 1.56-6.76; P = .002), CKD (HR, 6.25; 95% CI, 2.05-19.2; P = .001), and age (HR, 0.94; 95% CI, 0.91-0.98; P = .001). There were 41 patients (33%) who underwent eventual carotid revascularization (32 CEA, nine stent); 23 of 41 (56%) were performed for INS and 18 (44%) for plaque progression. Overall 5-year actuarial survival was 69.8% ± 4.1%. Multivariate predictors of death included: age (HR, 1.06; 95% CI, 1.03-1.1; P = .0001), chronic obstructive pulmonary disease (HR, 1.92; 95% CI, 1.08-3.41; P = .03), and diabetes (HR, 5.08; 95% CI, 2.86-9.01; P < .0001). The 5-year actuarial freedom from INS and\/or death was 54 ± 4.4%. Multivariate predictors of INS and\/or death were: VSS (HR, 1.98; 95% CI, 1.22-3.23; P = .006), CKD (HR, 5.46; 95% CI, 2.12-14.08; P = .0004), and diabetes (HR, 2.6; 95% CI, 1.59-4.24; P = .0001). Statin use was not protective against INS or death in this cohort.\nCONCLUSIONS: Medically managed patients with ASCAS develop INS early, especially in patients with VSS. Medical therapy with aspirin and statins failed to control ASCAS, thus validating the role of CEA in these patients as promulgated in multiple current treatment guidelines.",

Two groups were identified: PPCI (315 patients) and thrombolysis (379 patients). Ninety patients (13%) had RD defined by creatinine levels at admission > 130 micromol\/l, they were equally treated by PPCI and thrombolysis.\nRESULTS: In the PPCI group, despite a similar pre-procedural TIMI flow (P = 0.82),TIMI III restoring was significantly lower in the RD+ group (78.6% vs. 91.8%, P = 0.013). Suboptimal result was also higher in the RD+ group (13.6% vs. 2.7%, P < 0.001), but ST regression after TIMI III achievement was similar in the 2 groups (P = 0.43), probably reflecting no microvascular damage. In the thrombolysis group, successful reperfusion was also significantly lower when RD exists (58% vs. 74%, P = 0.03). After successful reperfusion, RD+ patients experienced higher in-hospital mortality in the PPCI group (29% vs. 4.3%; P < 0.001), whereas mortality was similar in the thrombolysis group (3% vs. 0%, P = 0.42).\nCONCLUSION: RD reduces either PPCI or thrombolysis success, with no proven microvascular damage after PPCI. In-hospital prognosis, however, is worse in the RD group only after successful PPCI, but not after successful streptokinase thrombolysis.",

He was referred with acute stent thrombosis with an atypical presentation of non-ST elevation myocardial infarction having unexplainable spontaneous resolution of electrocardiographic changes. The patient was successfully managed with newer generation drug-eluting stents reimplantation. The presence of acute onset of symptoms and thrombus containing soft lesion as documented during intervention supported the diagnosis of acute stent thrombosis.

Angiography was performed within 72 hours of presentation, after which 7,789 patients (56.4%) underwent PCI, 1,539 (11.1%) underwent CABG, and 4,491 (32.5%) received MT. The rate of NE (stroke or transient ischaemic attack) at 30 days and one year and its relationship to adverse ischaemic events, including death, were assessed. Thirty-day rates of NE were 1.1% with CABG, 0.3% with PCI, and 0.5% with MT (p<0.001). One-year rates of NE were 1.1% with CABG, 0.3% with PCI, and 0.6% with MT (p<0.001). Independent predictors of NE at 30 days and one year included age, renal insufficiency, baseline troponin elevation, and initial treatment with CABG. The occurrence of NE was a strong independent predictor of death at 30 days and one year (HR 4.07, 95% CI [1.49, 11.11], p=0.006, and HR 4.25, 95% CI [2.37, 7.62], p<0.001, respectively).\nCONCLUSIONS: In the large-scale ACUITY trial, CABG was associated with a higher risk of NE at 30 days and one year compared to PCI and MT.

        "Abstract":"Ischemic heart disease is a major risk factor for morbidity and mortality in patients with end-stage renal disease. However, long-term benefits of percutaneous coronary intervention (PCI) relative to coronary artery bypass grafting (CABG) in those patients is still unclear in the drug-eluting stent era. We identified 388 patients with multivessel and\/or left main disease with end-stage renal disease requiring dialysis among 15,939 patients undergoing first coronary revascularization enrolled in the Coronary REvascularization Demonstrating Outcome Study in Kyoto PCI\/CABG Registry Cohort-2 (PCI: 258 patients and CABG: 130 patients). The CABG group included more patients with 3-vessel (38% vs 57%, p <0.001) and left main disease (10% vs 34%, p <0.001). Preprocedural Synergy between Percutaneous Coronary Intervention with Taxus and Cardiac Surgery score in the CABG group was significantly higher than that in the PCI group (23.5 ± 8.7 vs 29.4 ± 11.0, p <0.001). Unadjusted 30-day mortality was 2.7% for PCI and 5.4% for CABG. Cumulative 5-year all-cause mortality was 52.3% for PCI and 49.9% for CABG. Propensity score-adjusted all-cause mortality was not different between PCI and CABG (hazard ratio [HR] 1.33, 95% confidence interval [CI] 0.85 to 2.09, p = 0.219). However, the excess risk of PCI relative to CABG for cardiac death was significant (HR 2.10, 95% CI 1.11 to 3.96, p = 0.02). The risk of sudden death was also higher after PCI (HR 4.83, 95% CI 1.01 to 23.08, p = 0.049). The risk of myocardial infarction after PCI tended to be higher than after CABG (HR 3.30, 95% CI 0.72 to 15.09, p = 0.12). The risk of any coronary revascularization after PCI was markedly higher after CABG (HR 3.78, 95% CI 1.91 to 7.50, p <0.001). Among the 201 patients who died during the follow-up, 94 patients (47%) died from noncardiac morbidities such as stroke, respiratory failure, and renal failure. In patients with multivessel and\/or left main disease undergoing dialysis, 5-year outcomes revealed that CABG relative to PCI reduced the risk of cardiac death, sudden death, myocardial infarction, and any revascularization. However, the risk of all-cause death was not different between PCI and CABG.",

Demographic and post-transplant follow-up including immunosuppression was similar in both groups. In the r-ATG group, donors were unrelated (spouse, n = 25), deceased (n = 31) and parents\/siblings (others), with a mean HLA match of 1.58. Donors in the basiliximab group were living unrelated (spouse, n = 15) and deceased (n = 5), with a mean HLA match of 1.56. No patient\/graft was lost in the r-ATG group over a mean of one year follow-up, and the mean SCr was 1.28 mg\/dL with 7.5% acute rejection (AR) episodes; infections were also not observed. In the basiliximab group, over the same period of follow-up, there was 95% death-censored graft survival, and the mean SCr was 1.23 mg\/dL with 10% AR episodes. One patient died due to bacterial pneumonia and one succumbed to coronary artery disease; one graft was lost due to uncontrolled acute humoral and cellular rejection. The cost of r-ATG and basiliximab were $600 and $2500, respectively. We conclude that induction immunosuppressive therapy with a low-dose r-ATG may be a better option as compared with basiliximab in terms of graft function, survival and cost benefit in kidney transplant patients.",

The purpose of this study was to evaluate different thrombolytic treatment strategies, and risk factors for complications.\nMETHODS: This was a retrospective analysis of prospective databases from two vascular centres. One centre used a higher dose of heparin and recombinant tissue plasminogen activator (rtPA).\nRESULTS: Some 749 procedures in 644 patients of median age 73 years were studied; 353 (47·1 per cent) of the procedures were done in women. The aetiology of ischaemia was graft occlusion in 38·8 per cent, acute arterial thrombosis in 32·2 per cent, embolus in 22·3 per cent and popliteal aneurysm in 6·7 per cent. Concomitant heparin infusion was used in 63·2 per cent. The mean dose of rtPA administered was 21·0 mg, with a mean duration of 25·2 h. Technical success was achieved in 80·2 per cent. Major amputation and death within 30 days occurred in 13·1 and 4·4 per cent respectively. Bleeding complications occurred in 227 treatments (30·3 per cent). Blood transfusion was needed in 104 (13·9 per cent). Three patients (0·4 per cent of procedures) had intracranial bleeding; all were fatal. Amputation-free survival was 83·6 per cent at 30 days at both centres. In multivariable analysis, preoperative severe ischaemia with motor deficit was the only independent risk factor for major bleeding (odds ratio (OR) 2·98; P <0·001). Independent risk factors for fasciotomy were severe ischaemia (OR 2·94) and centre (OR 6·50). Embolic occlusion was protective for major amputation at less than 30 days (OR 0·30; P = 0·003). Independent risk factors for death within 30 days were cerebrovascular disease (OR 3·82) and renal insufficiency (OR 3·86).\nCONCLUSION: Both treatment strategies were successful in achieving revascularization with acceptable complication rates.

Acute kidney injury was defined by the Acute Kidney Injury Network classification.\nRESULTS: The incidence of kidney injury was reduced in the N-acetylcystein group (57.1% versus 28.6%, p=0.016). Nonuse of N-acetylcystein (relative risk 3.58, 95% confidence interval: 1.04 to 12.33, p=0.04) and cardiopulmonary bypass (relative risk 4.55, 95% confidence interval: 1.28 to 16.15, p=0.02) were independent predictors of kidney injury. In patients treated with CPB, N-acetylcystein reduced the incidence of kidney injury from 63% to 46%. Oxidative stress was increased in control subjects (p=0.01) and abolished in patients receiving N-acetylcystein.\nCONCLUSIONS: Maximum intravenous doses of N-acetylcystein reduce the incidence of acute kidney injury in patients with kidney disease undergoing coronary artery bypass graft surgery, abolish oxidative stress, and mitigate the negative effect of CPB on renal function.",

        "Abstract":"BACKGROUND: Immunosuppression regimens in transplantation medicine are complex. Drugs with extended release action have simplified medication dosing without affecting efficacy.\nMATERIAL\/METHODS: This prospective, observational, multicenter study, conducted in a routine medical practice setting, evaluated changes in tacrolimus daily dose and trough levels and patient-reported medication adherence at day 90 after 1:1 (mg: mg) conversion to once-daily tacrolimus in adult liver and kidney transplant recipients.\nRESULTS: Data from 224 recipients of a liver (n=19) or kidney (n=205) transplant, average age 51±14.5 years, were evaluated. The mean change in tacrolimus daily dose was +0.04 mg\/day. Dose remained stable after conversion in 62.5%, was lower in 15.6%, and higher in 22% of patients. Trough level after conversion was lower in 62.6% and higher in 36.5%; generally, levels were 12.8% lower than pre-conversion levels. No acute rejection, graft loss, or serious safety events were observed. Two deaths occurred due to myocardial infarction. Conversion helped 19% to less frequently forget medications and 55% reported no difference in remembering to take the once-daily dose after conversion. The change in dosing frequency was identified as \"better\" for 55%.\nCONCLUSIONS: Tacrolimus daily dose remained stable while trough levels were significantly lower after conversion to once-daily dosing.

The aim of the study was to compare zotarolimus- and everolimus-eluting stents used during primary PCI in patients with acute myocardial infarction (AMI) and CKD.\nMETHODS: We selected 854 consecutive ST-elevation MI patients with CKD (estimated glomerular filtration rate <60 mL\/min\/1.73 m(2)) undergoing primary PCI who were followed up for 12 months. They were divided into two groups based on type of stents implanted: (1) zotarolimus-eluting stent (ZES) and (2) everolimus-eluting stent (EES). The study end point was the 12-month major adverse cardiac events (MACE) which included all-cause death, non-fatal MI, target lesion revascularization (TLR), and target vessel revascularization (TVR).\nRESULTS: The average number of stents used per vessel was 1.4 ± 0.7. A total of 433 patients received ZES and 421 patients received EES. There was no significant difference in the incidence of 12-month MI, TLR, or TVR. All-cause death was found to be borderline significant between two groups (2.8% in ZES vs 0.9% in EES, p=0.05). The incidence of 12-month MACE in ZES and EES was 5.7% and 2.6% respectively, p=0.022. Stent thrombosis did not differ between groups (p=0.677). Kaplan-Meier analysis did not show significant difference for 12-month MACE-free survival between groups (log-rank p=0.158).

        "Abstract":"AIMS: Recent guidelines on acute myocardial infarction (AMI) are based on randomized clinical trials (RCTs) and registries with selected patients, and may therefore not represent 'real-life'. This analysis shows for the first time nationwide trends in AMI from Germany.\nMETHODS AND RESULTS: We were provided with data on all in-patient hospitalizations by the Federal Statistical Office. All hospitalized cases with AMI (onset of symptoms <28 days) from the years 2005, 2007, and 2009 were analysed regarding morbidity, in-hospital mortality, treatments, and costs. Analysis of a total of 16.1, 16.6, and 17.2 million hospitalizations showed the proportion of coded AMI to remain relatively constant (1276, 1272, and 1181 per 100 000 hospitalizations in 2005, 2007, and 2009). The proportion of ST-elevation AMI decreased over time (STEMI; 631, 546, and 454 per 100 000 hospitalizations),while non-ST-elevation AMI increased (NSTEMI; 645, 726, and 727 per 100 000 hospitalizations). The proportion of older patients >75 years (+4.6%), of comorbidities such as hypertension (+5.8%), diabetes (+17.7%), left ventricular failure (+19.8%), peripheral artery disease (+13.3%), and chronic kidney disease (+165.4%) increased as well. In-hospital mortality remained relatively stable during this period in AMI cases overall (11.1, 10.7, 10.8%) but changed slightly in STEMI (11.2, 11.9, 12.2%) and NSTEMI (11.0, 9.9, 9.9%). Causing about 1.2% of hospitalizations, AMI accounted for 2.5% (1.2 billion €) of in-hospital health expenses.\nCONCLUSION: This hospitalization-based analysis revealed a marked increase of NSTEMI among constant AMI frequency. Despite all current efforts, in-hospital mortality was stagnating on a high level compared with data of RCTs.",

        "Abstract":"BACKGROUND: Approximately 10% of patients who undergo surgical procedures require chronic oral anticoagulation. Physicians must balance the thromboembolic and bleeding risks to make informed decisions on whether to continue anticoagulant medication. Evidence is lacking regarding the perioperative management of novel oral anticoagulant (NOAC) agents. This survey aims to describe the management of perioperative NOAC use during device implantation by Canadian centres.\nMETHODS: A Web-based tool was used to survey all Canadian adult pacemaker\/defibrillator implant centres. The survey collected data regarding the perioperative management of NOACs in atrial fibrillation patients at high risk for thromboembolism who undergo device implantation.\nRESULTS: Twenty-two centres performed approximately 14,971 device implants; 1150 (8%) of these implants were in patients who were prescribed a NOAC. In 82% of centres, the NOAC is discontinued in anticipation of device implantation; 73% of these centres do not bridge with heparin. In patients with normal renal function at high risk of thromboembolic events (Congestive Heart Failure, Hypertension, Age, Diabetes, Stroke\/Transient Ischemic Attack; CHADS2 ≥ 2), 72% of the centres restart the NOAC within 48 hours of the procedure. For patients with abnormal renal function (glomerular filtration rate < 80 mL\/min), the timing of NOAC discontinuation is variable. Hematoma rates vary from 0 to 30%.\nCONCLUSIONS: Most Canadian centres perform device implantation with NOAC interruption without the use of bridging. The timing of stopping and restarting anticoagulation and incidence of bleeding complications is variable. These findings emphasize the need for randomized controlled studies to guide the optimal approach to management of NOACs during device implantation.",

However, the information of optimal medical therapy in dialysis population is scant. We assessed the efficacy of statin on the clinical outcomes after Sirolimus-eluting stent (SES) implantation in patients with and without dialysis.\nMETHODS AND RESULTS: We analyzed date from 843 consecutive patients who successfully treated with SES in our institution between August 2004 and November 2006. Among patients, 96 patients (11.4%) were undergoing dialysis. In non-dialysis patients, 405 patients (54%) were treated with statin at hospital discharge. In dialysis patients, only 16 patients (17%) were treated with statin. In non-dialysis patients, mortality rate was significantly lower in patients treated with statin than those without statin (4.4% vs. 13.9%, p<0.0001). While in dialysis patients, mortality rate was similar between patients treated with and without statin (56.3% vs. 57.6%, p=0.86).

Unlike clopidogrel (Plavix®), ticagrelor has a quicker offset of action, and therefore, it seems that platelet function recovers faster on discontinuation of therapy. These drugs sometimes cannot be stopped before coronary artery bypass grafting due to the risk of stent thrombosis or in case of emergency operations. Therefore, we investigated whether the continued preoperative use of ticagrelor influences the perioperative course of cardiac surgical patients.\nMETHODS: The perioperative course and clinical outcomes of patients preoperatively receiving ticagrelor + acetylsalicylic acid (ASA) (n = 32) or clopidogrel + ASA (n = 49) until cardiac surgery, performed at University of Goettingen between January 2012 and December 2012, were studied. The study was designed as a retrospective observational study. The observation period started with the surgery and ended after 3 days. P < 0.05 was considered statistically significant.\nRESULTS: Preoperative data and intraoperative characteristics were almost similar among the groups. In the first 24 h, the median blood loss was 850 [780-1600] ml in the ticagrelor group and 680 [400-860] ml in the clopidogrel group (P = 0.0006). Furthermore, the median red blood cell transfusion (P = 0.0031), the median pooled platelet transfusion (P = 0.0012), the median prothrombin complex concentrate use (P = 0.0114) and the median fibrinogen use (P = 0.0118) were significantly higher in the ticagrelor group compared with the clopidogrel group. However, there was no statistical significance between the two groups regarding intensive care unit and hospital stay, mechanical ventilation time, incidence of acute kidney injury and mortality. Hence, a tendency towards more rethoracotomies due to bleeding in the ticagrelor group was observed (P = 0.0632).\nCONCLUSIONS: In cardiac surgical patients who are treated with ticagrelor + ASA until surgery, ticagrelor therapy is associated with a significantly higher blood loss, a significantly higher use of blood products and coagulation factors and higher incidence of rethoracotomies for bleeding compared with patients treated with clopidogrel + ASA.",

        "Published":null,
        "Abstract":"Since 2001 independent Organ Donor Facilities(OFOs) have been proposed within Organ Procurement Organizations (OPOs) with the aim of reducing organ procurement costs 1, cold ischemia time of donor organs and the flight-related risk 2 for donor surgeons, perfusionists and coordinators. An independent OFO has been established in 2001 in St. Louis 3, half away between the 2 Transplant Centers (TCs) (Washington University School of Medicine and St. Louis University) and now includes a two-bed intensive care facility, a complete laboratory, a cardiac catheterization facility, a Computed Tomography (CT) scanner and an operating room. All brain-dead (BD) patients within OPO (Mid-America Transplant Services), after family's informed consent, are transferred, if necessary by an OPO owned and operated airplane, to this facility, where undergo multiorgan harvesting. By doing so the organ acquisition charges (OACs) apparently decreased, as well as delay in recovery, which can affect organ viability and move families to withdraw consent; also risks and tiring of transplant surgeons were reduced. This independent OFO successfully procured in 2001 not only livers, but also pancreas, kidneys, hearts and lungs 4-6. Cold ischemia time was reduced and there was no Primary Non Function (PNF) of harvested organs, but only kidney delayed graft function (DGF). In the past, heart donors were moved to the recipient's hospital. With the development of multiorgan harvesting, usually donor surgeons are sent by the TCs in order to evaluate liver, pancreas, heart and lungs, while the only local surgeons is the \"nephrectomist\", that in local hospital is not a transplant surgeon. To move a donor, although hemodinamically stable, is always a risk. Finally, the decrease of OAC must balance the extra expenses to create and operate independent OFOs. In all the papers published by the members of this OFO, the control group of the retrospective analysis consisted of less selected BD donors, requiring more vasosuppressor support, which can be a study bias. It has been proposed that OPOs should organize \"recovery teams\" for multiple TCs but most transplant surgeons, in case of marginal donors, would like to inspect the organ prior to starting recipient surgery or would send their own team to harvest organs. According to literature, there are no other independent OFOs in US, probably because there is no need for them, and increasing their numbers would not increase organ donation rate. Considering Europe, we do not have information about the existence of independent OFOs: this may be a consequence of logistical organization and minor distances, as well as the higher concentration of TCs. However, the acceptance of such a procedure from donors' families may be less enthusiastic in Europe than in USA, particularly from minorities. In Italy would not be acceptable that the maintenance of BD donors and more generally the operation of independent OFO would rely on non-physicians, to save costs. Finally it is not clear from the reviewed papers who pay for transportation of the donor's body from the independent OFO back to home, but donor's family should not be charged for these expenses. At least 5 donors were lost during transportation, confirming that moving of BD donors remains a risky procedure. The potential economical and organizative benefits of independent OFOs could be counterweighted by the perceived (by relatives and public opinion) commodification\/ reification of BD patients. Anyway, the authors of these papers should be congratulated for their innovative proposal. However, a prospective randomized trial would be needed to draw more definitive conclusions on the real benefits of independent OFOs.",

        "Abstract":"The number of off-pump coronary artery surgery procedures in high-risk patients such as renal failure, hepatic failure and in anticoagulant drug using patients is increasing. The associated co morbidity and repeated use of electrocautery in postoperative bleeding, caused a susceptibility of patients to pressure or electrocautery ulcers. During a period of three years, 1400 off-pump coronary artery bypass surgery were performed in our center. Of these patients, 20 (A group) suffered from electrocautery sore (ES) and 40 (B group) had pressure sore (PS). These patients were compared with respect to variables such as age, hypertension, hypercholesterolemia, operating time, smoking, opium using, diabetes, weight, sex, respiratory failure, renal failure, and cerebrovascular accident, intra aortic balloon pump using, inotropic drug using by x2 or t test, according to categorical or continuous variables consequently. Electrocautery sore and pressure ulcer as dependence variables and others variables with p value less than 0.1 entered a multivariable logistic regression model and odd ratio of significant variables were obtained. These two groups of patients were different with respect to variables such as age, sex, respiratory failure and cerebrovascular accident and, in the logistic regression model, two factors predicted pressure sore, respiratory failure and cerebrovascular accident, but the only factor that was significant in predicting electrocautery sore in multiple logistic regression analysis was postoperative bleeding. Results of this study revealed that pressure sore is a patient dependent complication in contrast with the electrocautery sore, which is related to technical or device faults and to experience and care of operating room staff.",

        "Published":null,
        "Abstract":"BACKGROUND: Different anesthetic techniques have been used for fast tracking in cardiac anesthesia. Remifentanil, with its unique pharmacokinetic profile, could be an ideal drug for fast tracking. Possible limitations of remifentanil are rapid onset of postoperative pain after discontinuation of the drug infusion, which may increase the risk of an ischemic event. We conducted this randomized study to compare the efficacy of remifentanil versus low doses of fentanyl in fast-track cardiac anesthesia. It has been hypothesized that remifentanil would provide a safe anesthesia with no impact on myocardial function and with positive effects on extubation time and mobilization.\nMETHODS: We compared the postoperative course of patients, the remifentanil group (RG) and the low-dose fentanyl group (LDFG), in whom remifentanil and low-dose fentanyl, respectively, were used for fast-track cardiac anesthesia. The study was designed as a prospective randomized study. The primary outcomes were changes in the cardiac index and creatine kinase MB fraction (CKMB), extubation times, mobilization times, and lengths of stay in the intensive care unit (ICU) and the hospital. Frequency of myocardial infarction (MI), reoperations due to excessive bleeding, renal impairment, and cerebral complications were registered as well.\nRESULTS: Seventy-one patients were enrolled in the study, and 7 were excluded due to difficult airway, bleeding, and technical difficulties. The RG comprised 33 patients and the LDFG comprised of 31 patients. There were no differences between the groups in terms of age, Euroscore, types of surgery, extracorporeal circulation, and aortic cross-clamp time. We did not find significant difference in cardiac index, CKMB, extubation times, mobilization times, length of stay in the ICU and in the hospital between the groups. Postoperative complications such as MI, rates of reoperations, renal and cerebral complications and incidence of atrial fibrillation did not show any significant differences.\nCONCLUSIONS: Remifentanil fast-track anesthesia for cardiac patients has no negative impact on myocardial function. Both remifentanil and low-dose fentanyl are equally effective and safe for fast-track cardiac anesthesia. The study did not highlight any statistical superiority of remifentanil anesthesia over low-dose fentanyl anesthesia.",

        "Abstract":"OBJECTIVE: Thrombolysis as a treatment for acute limb ischemia (ALI) has become a first-line therapy based on studies published over 2 decades ago. The purpose of this study was to assess outcomes of patients treated for ALI using contemporary thrombolytic agents and endovascular techniques.\nMETHODS: Consecutive patients with ALI of the lower extremities treated between 2005 and 2011 were identified, and their records were retrospectively reviewed. All patients were treated with tissue plasminogen activator delivered via catheter-directed thrombolysis (CDT) and\/or pharmacomechanical thrombolysis (PMT), with other adjunctive endovascular or surgical interventions. Procedural success, thrombolysis duration, and 30-day and long-term outcomes were obtained for the whole series and were also compared between the CDT and PMT groups. Limb salvage and survival were assessed using time-to-event methods, including Kaplan-Meier estimation and Cox proportional hazards models.\nRESULTS: A total of 154 limbs were treated in 147 patients presenting with ALI (Rutherford class I, 9.7%; class IIa, 70.1%; class IIb, 20.1%). The mean follow-up was 15.20 months (range, 0.56-56.84 months). Indications for intervention included embolization (14.3%), thrombosed bypass (36.4%), thrombosed stent (26.6%), native artery thrombosis (24.0%), and thrombosed popliteal aneurysm (3.2%). Technical success was achieved in 83.8% of cases, with a 30-day mortality rate of 5.2%. Procedural complications included systemic bleeding (5.2%), access site hematoma (4.5%), acute renal failure (1.9%), and distal embolization (9.7%). The mean runoff score decreased from 13.42 preintervention to 7.43 postintervention. Adjuvant revascularization procedures were required in 89.0% of patients and were endovascular (68.8%), hybrid (9.1%), or open (11.0%). Only 3.2% of patients required a fasciotomy. The overall rate of major amputation was 15.0% (18.1% for CDT only, 11.3% for PMT; P = NS). Predictors of limb loss by Cox proportional hazards models included end-stage renal disease (hazard ratio [HR], 8.563; P < .001) and poor pedal outflow, with an incremental protective effect for improved pedal outflow (HR, 0.205; P < .001 for one pedal outflow vessel; HR, 0.074; P < .001 for ≥ two pedal outflow vessels). Gender, smoking, diabetes, Rutherford score, runoff score, thrombosed popliteal aneurysm, and PMT were not significant predictors of limb loss. The use of PMT was a significant predictor of technical success (odds ratio, 2.67; P = .046).\nCONCLUSIONS: Endovascular therapy with thrombolysis using tissue plasminogen activator remains an effective treatment option for patients presenting with mild or moderate lower extremity ALI, with equal benefit derived with CDT or PMT. Patients with end-stage renal disease or poor pedal outflow have an increased risk of limb loss and may benefit from alternative revascularization strategies.",

        "Abstract":"BACKGROUND: Percutaneous coronary interventions in patients with chronic kidney disease have shown suboptimal results. Drug-eluting stents (DES) might reduce the rate of target vessel revascularization in comparison with bare-metal stents (BMS) in patients with chronic kidney disease. However, given the multiple concomitant individual variables present in such patients, the comparison of neointimal growth after percutaneous coronary intervention is complex and difficult to assess.\nMETHODS AND RESULTS: Randomized Comparison of Xience V and Multi-Link Vision Coronary Stents in the Same Multivessel Patient with Chronic Kidney Disease (RENAL-DES) was a prospective, randomized, multicenter study to directly compare the efficacy in the prevention of clinical restenosis of everolimus-eluting stent (Xience V) and BMS with an identical design (Multi-Link Vision), both implanted in the same patient with multivessel coronary artery disease and chronic kidney disease (estimated glomerular filtration rate <60 mL\/min). The primary end point of the study was the ischemia-driven target vessel revascularization as detected with myocardial scintigraphy at 12 months. In 215 patients, 512 coronary vessels were successfully treated with the randomly assigned DES (n=257) or BMS (n=255). At 1 year, the rate of ischemia-driven target vessel revascularization for DES and BMS groups was 2.7% (95% confidence interval, 1.1%-5.6%) and 11.4% (95% confidence interval, 7.8% to 16%), respectively, P<0.001. For the multivariate analysis, independent predictors of the ischemia-driven target vessel revascularization were BMS implantation (odds ratio, 4.95; 95% confidence interval, 2.1-11.6; P<0.001) and vessel size (odds ratio, 0.32; 95% confidence interval, 0.1-0.7; P=0.006).\nCONCLUSIONS: This is the first randomized trial showing a reduction of clinical restenosis with a new-generation DES in comparison with a BMS of equal design, in patients who have chronic kidney disease with multivessel coronary artery disease.\nCLINICAL TRIAL REGISTRATION URL: http:\/\/clinicaltrials.gov.

However, there are few data describing the clinical value of statins in patients with coronary artery disease and chronic kidney disease (CKD) undergoing PCI. Of 10,148 patients who entered into Evaluation of Drug Eluting Stents and Ischemic Events, a multicenter registry of unselected patients undergoing PCI from July 2004 to December 2007, we studied 2,306 patients with CKD (estimated glomerular filtration rate ≤60 ml\/min based on the Modified Diet in Renal Disease calculation). Patients were stratified into those receiving statins at discharge (n = 1,833, 79%) or not (n = 473, 21%). Patients in the statin group had a greater prevalence of hypertension, recent myocardial infarction (MI), and use of β blockers and angiotensin-converting enzyme inhibitors. Outcomes were assessed from discharge through 1-year follow-up. One-year all-cause mortality was 5.7% in statin group versus 8.7% in the no statin group (adjusted hazard ratio 0.55, 95% confidence interval 0.34 to 0.88). The composite of death, MI, and repeat revascularization was lower in statin group (adjusted hazard ratio 0.71, 95% confidence interval 0.51 to 0.99). In conclusion, among patients with CKD undergoing PCI, the prescription of statins at hospital discharge was associated with a significant improvement in subsequent outcomes including mortality and composite end point of death, MI, and repeat revascularization.",

When OTR was assessed, clinical significance was found only in high-risk diabetic (HR: 2.11, 95% CI: 1.29 to 3.45, p < 0.001) and chronic kidney disease (HR: 2.03, 95% CI: 1.03 to 4.02, p = 0.04) patients.\nCONCLUSIONS: CYP2C19 metabolizer status is an independent predictor of MACE after DES implantation and can be used for prognostication in all stable CAD patients. High OTR, as assessed by the VerifyNow P2Y12 test, is an independent predictor of MACE only for high-risk subsets, that is, patients with diabetes or chronic kidney disease.",

        "Abstract":"INTRODUCTION: Chronic obstructive pulmonary disease (COPD) has traditionally been recognised as a predictor of poorer early outcomes in patients undergoing coronary artery bypass grafting (CABG). The aim of this study was to analyse the impact of different COPD stages, as defined by the Global Initiative for Chronic Obstructive Lung Disease (GOLD) spirometric criteria, on the early surgical outcomes in patients undergoing primary isolated non-emergency CABG.\nMETHOD: Between January 2008 and April 2012, 1 737 consecutive patients underwent isolated CABG in the Department of Cardiovascular Surgery of Gulhane Military Academy of Medicine; 127 patients with the diagnosis of moderate-risk COPD were operated on. Only 104 patients with available pulmonary function tests and no missing data were included in the study. Two different treatment protocols had been used before and after 2010. Before 2010, no treatment was applied to patients with moderate COPD before the CABG procedure. After 2010, a pre-treatment protocol was initiated. Patients who had undergone surgery between 2008 and 2010 were placed in group 1 (no pre-treatment, n = 51) and patients who had undergone surgery between 2010 and 2012 comprised group 2 (pre-treatment group, n = 53). These two groups were compared according to the postoperative morbidity and mortality rates retrospectively, from medical reports.\nRESULTS: The mean ages of the patients in both groups were 62.1 ± 7.6 and 64.5 ± 6.4 years, respectively. Thirty-nine of the patients in group 1 and 38 in group 2 were male. There were similar numbers of risk factors such as diabetes, hypertension, renal disease (two patients in each group), previous stroke and myocardial infarction in both groups. The mean ejection fractions of the patients were 53.3 ± 11.5% and 50.2 ± 10.8%, respectively. Mean EuroSCOREs of the patients were 5.5 ± 2.3 and 5.9 ± 2.5, respectively in the groups. The average numbers of the grafts were 3.1 ± 1.0 and 2.9 ± 0.9. Mean extubation times were 8.52 ± 1.3 hours in group 1 and 6.34 ± 1.0 hours in group 2. The numbers of patients who needed pharmacological inotropic support were 12 in group 1 and five in group 2. Duration of hospital stay of the patients was shorter in group 2. While there were 14 patients with post-operative atrial fibrillation (PAF) in group 1, the number of patients with PAF in group 2 was five. Whereas there were seven patients who had pleural effusions requiring drainage in group 1, there were only two in group 2. There were three mortalities in group 1, and one in group 2. There were no sternal infections and sternal dehiscences in either group.\nCONCLUSION: Pre-treatment in moderate-risk COPD patients improved post-operative outcomes while decreasing adverse events and complications. Therefore for patients undergoing elective CABG, we recommend the use of medical treatment.",

        "Published":"2013-10-05",
        "Abstract":"INTRODUCTION: Some studies have proved that Tranexamic acid infusion is associated with a decrease in blood loss during and after surgery. Due to the availability of an oral form of the drug, the rapid and complete absorption of it and ease of administration without need for specific instruments, we evaluated the effectiveness of the oral form in decreasing blood loss after total knee arthroplasty.\nMATERIALS AND METHODS: In this double-blind, randomized, parallel clinical trial study, we evaluated 53 patients undergoing knee arthroplasty admitted to Ghaem hospital, Mashhad in 2012. Patients with any history of severe ischemic heart diseases, renal failure, cirrhosis, history of bleeding disorders or thromboembolic events, were excluded from the study. The patients were randomly allocated into 27 patients with and 26 patients without Tranexamic acid. Blood loss (mL) at 12 and at 24h and hematocrit at 24h were measured postoperatively. The results were analyzed with SPSS software (11.5 version) using independent and paired sample t-tests. A p-value ≤ 0.05 was considered to be significant.\nRESULTS: The average blood loss after 12h of surgery in the control and Tranexamic acid groups were 462.9 (± 147.4) and 274.6 (± 139)mL, respectively (p<0.001) and after 24h of surgery they were 588.8 (± 193)and 364 (± 165.1)mL, respectively (p<0.001). The mean decrease in the hematocrit after surgery was 4.7% in the Tranexamic acid group and 6.8% in the control group (p=0.016).\nCONCLUSION: Prescription of oral Tranexamic acid before knee arthroplasty can cause remarkable decrease in blood loss after surgery and also less decrease in hematocrit. The advantages of the oral route of the drug versus the intravenous form is that it can be used routinely as a safe and effective way to decrease bleeding after surgery.",

        "Abstract":"The occurrence of heart failure during the whole pre-discharge course of coronary revascularization, as far as its influence on subsequent prognosis, is poorly understood. The present study examined the effect of transient heart failure (THF) developing in the acute and rehabilitative phase on survival after coronary artery bypass graft surgery (CABG) and percutaneous coronary intervention (PCI). Patients in the Italian survey on cardiac rehabilitation and secondary prevention after cardiac revascularization (ICAROS) were analyzed for THF, the latter being defined either as signs and symptoms consistent with decompensation or cardiogenic shock. ICAROS was a prospective, multicenter registry of 1,262 consecutive patients discharged from 62 cardiac rehabilitation (CR) facilities, providing data on risk factors, lifestyle habits, drug treatments, and major cardiovascular events (MACE) during a 1-year follow-up. Records were linked to the official website of the Italian Association of Cardiovascular Prevention and Rehabilitation (GICR-IACPR). The overall prevalence of pre-discharge THF was 7.6%, with 69.8% of cases in acute wards, 22.9% during CR, and 7.3% in both settings. THF affected more frequently patients with chronic cardiac condition (42.7 vs. 30.6%; p < 0.05), age ≥75 years (33.3 vs. 23.1%; p < 0.005), COPD (19.8 vs. 12.3%; p < 0.05), and chronic kidney disease (17.7 vs. 7%; p < 0.001). After discharge, THF patients showed good maintenance rates of RAAS modulators (90.6%) and beta-blockers (83.3%), while statin therapy significantly decreased from 81.3 to 64.6% (p < 0.05). The pursuit of secondary prevention targets, as far as self-reported drug adherence, was not different among groups. Patients with THF had increased 1-year mortality (8.3 vs. 1.6%, p < 0.001). Moreover, THF independently predicted adverse outcome with OR for recurrent events (mainly further episodes of decompensation) of 2.4 (CI 1.4-4.3). Patients who experienced THF after coronary revascularization had increased post-discharge mortality and cardiovascular events. Hemodynamic instability, rather than recurrent myocardial ischemia, seems to be linked with worse prognosis.",

A 69-year-old male was admitted to our hospital with a one-hour history of palpitation and epigastric pain. He had inferior myocardial infarction and percutaneous coronary intervention to the right coronary artery two weeks before. Coronary angiogram was performed, and no significant stenosis was detected. One hour later, epigastric pain spread to the left flank region. Spiral computerized tomography showed occlusion of the left renal artery. Emergency abdominal angiography was performed, and selective intra-arterial infusion of TPA was started promptly. The abdominal pain disappeared, and urine output remained adequate. Forty-eight hours later, angiographic follow-up confirmed the complete lysis of the thrombus in the left renal artery. No renal or hemorrhagic complications were observed, and the patient was discharged four days later with normalized renal function on oral anticoagulation.",

CI-AKI was defined as an increase in creatinine concentration of ≥0.5 mg\/dl or ≥25% above baseline within 72 h after contrast administration.\nRESULTS: The incidence of CI-AKI was significantly lower in the statin group than in controls (6.7% vs. 15.1%; adjusted odds ratio: 0.38; 95% confidence interval [CI]: 0.20 to 0.71; p = 0.003). The benefits against CI-AKI were consistent, even applying different CI-AKI definition criteria and in all the pre-specified risk categories. The 30-day incidence of adverse cardiovascular and renal events (death, dialysis, myocardial infarction, stroke, or persistent renal damage) was significantly lower in the statin group (3.6% vs. 7.9%, respectively; p = 0.036).

However, some \"bioequivalent\" generic (GE) drugs are less effective than the innovator (IN) drug. Therefore, the aim of this study was to compare contrast media (IN drug)-induced renal dysfunction with contrast media (GE drug)-induced dysfunction. We enrolled 44 patients who underwent elective CAG or percutaneous coronary intervention (PCI) and randomly divided them into two groups that received contrast media (Iohexol, nonionic and low-osmolality contrast agent) containing either IN drug (Omnipaque) or GE drug (Iopaque).

Biochemical parameters in blood (serum creatinine, cystatin C, high-sensitivity C-reactive protein, and pentraxin-3) and urine (urinary albumin\/Cr and liver-type fatty acid binding protein\/Cr) were measured. There were no significant differences in the biochemical parameters at baseline between the groups. In addition, there were no differences in changes in biochemical parameters in blood and urine before and after CAG or PCI between the groups, although one patient in the GE group had CIN. The degree of contrast in Iopaque-induced renal dysfunction was comparable with that in Omnipaque-induced dysfunction.",

        "Abstract":"INTRODUCTION: Cardiovascular causes are the first causes of death in elderly patients. Nevertheless, elderly patients are underrepresented in randomized studies of acute coronary syndromes although treatment of ACS for elderly patients has specificities that need special attention.\nMETHODS AND RESULTS: To discuss these specificities, we realized a retrospective study involving patients aged more than 75years old and admitted for ACS in the cardiology department of Aix-en-Provence General Hospital in the first six months of 2010 (Group A) and 2012 (Group B) which we compared. Initial presentation was chest pain in only 78.6% of Group A versus 81.6% in Group B (NS), renal insufficiency was found in 41.4% of the patients of Group A versus 50.5% of the patients in Group B (NS), anaemia was found in 34.3% of Group A patients versus 40.2% of Group B (NS), invasive strategy is less systematic with 74.2% of Group A patients having a revascularization versus 73.6% of Group B (NS), Drug Eluting Stents were less frequently used with 14.3% of Group A patients versus 14.7% of Group B (NS), radial access was used for angioplasty in 61.2% of Group A patients versus 80.2% of Group B (P=0.02), unfractioned heparin was used in 74.3% of the cases in Group A versus 68% in Group B (NS).\nDISCUSSION AND CONCLUSION: Acute coronary syndrome of the elderly patients has numerous specificities, first there are frequent unusual presentation making diagnosis more difficult, second they have frequent co morbidities making them frail patients with higher risk of hemorrhagic complications and lesser tendency to invasive evidence based treatment. In the absence of specific recommendations, their treatment should not differ from younger patients. This work allowed us also to evaluate our professional practices in order to improve them; we note a positive evolution with the significant raise in the use of radial access, invasive strategy though should be more systematic and use of low molecular weight heparin and Fondaparinux should be more frequent.",

        "Abstract":"Chronic kidney disease (CKD) is an important clinical co-morbidity that increases the risk of death and myocardial infarction in patients with coronary artery disease (CAD) even when treated with guideline-directed therapies. It is unknown, however, whether CKD influences the effects of CAD treatments on patients' health status, their symptoms, function, and quality of life. We performed a post hoc analysis of the Clinical Outcomes Utilizing Revascularization and Aggressive Drug Evaluation (COURAGE) study to compare health status in patients with stable CAD with and without CKD defined as a glomerular filtration rate of <60 ml\/min\/1.73 m(2) randomized to either percutaneous coronary intervention (PCI) and optimal medical therapy (OMT) or OMT alone. Health status was measured at baseline, 1, 3, 6, 12, 24, and 36 months of follow-up with the Seattle Angina Questionnaire in 310 patients with CKD and 1,719 patients without CKD. Linear mixed-effects models were used to analyze Seattle Angina Questionnaire scores longitudinally. Mean scores for angina-related quality of life, angina frequency, and physical limitation domains improved from baseline values in both patients with and without CKD and plateaued. Early improvement (1 to 6 months) was more common in patients treated with PCI plus OMT than with OMT alone in both patients with and without CKD. Treatment satisfaction scores were high at baseline in all groups and did not change significantly over time. In conclusion, although CKD is an important determinant of event-free survival in patients with stable CAD, it neither precludes satisfactory treatment of angina with PCI plus OMT or OMT alone nor is it associated with an unsatisfactory quality of life.",

However, patients with severe left ventricular dysfunction (ejection fraction <35%) were underrepresented in these trials, and management of these complex patients remains unclear. The purpose of this study was to compare the outcomes of patients with coronary artery disease and left ventricular dysfunction undergoing CABG versus PCI.\nMETHODS: The Alberta Provincial Project for Outcome Assessment in Coronary Heart Disease (APPROACH), a clinical data collection and outcome monitoring initiative for the province of Alberta, Canada, was used to identify 2925 patients with coronary artery disease and left ventricular dysfunction undergoing CABG (n = 1,326) or PCI (n = 1,599) between 1995 and 2008. Patients were propensity matched to obtain comparable subgroups among left ventricular dysfunction patients.\nRESULTS: Cox proportional hazard analysis of the propensity-matched subgroups identified that CABG was significantly associated with lower rates of repeat revascularization and better survival compared with PCI at 1, 5, 10, and 15 years. Other significant independent predictors of poor long-term survival included age, renal failure, heart failure, diabetes mellitus, peripheral vascular disease, prior myocardial infarction, left main coronary artery disease, and prior CABG.\nCONCLUSIONS: For patients with coronary artery disease and left ventricular dysfunction, CABG was associated with lower rates of repeat revascularization and improved survival over PCI, after adjustment for baseline risk profile differences.

This study compared the effects of normal saline (NS) and Plasmalyte on acid-base balance and electrolytes during living donor kidney transplantation using the Stewart and base excess (BE) methods.\nMETHODS: Patients were randomized to an NS group (n = 30) or a Plasmalyte group (n = 30). Arterial blood samples were collected for acid-base analysis after induction of anesthesia (T0), prior to clamping the iliac vein (T1), 10 minutes after reperfusion of the donated kidney (T2), and at the end of surgery (T3). In addition serum creatinine and 24-hour urine output were recorded on postoperative days 1,2, and 7. Over the first postoperative 7 days we recorded episodes of graft failure requiring dialysis.\nRESULTS: Compared with the Plasmalyte group, the NS group showed significantly lower values of pH, BE, and effective strong ion differences during the postreperfusion period (T2 and T3). Chloride-related values (chloride [Cl(-)], free-water corrected Cl(-), BEcl) were significantly higher at T1, T2, and T3, indicating hyperchloremic rather than dilutional metabolic acidosis. Early postoperative graft functions in terms of serum creatinine, urine output, and graft failure requiring dialysis were not significantly different between the groups.\nCONCLUSIONS: Both NS and Plamalyte can be used safely during uncomplicated living donor kidney transplantation. However, Plasmalyte more stably maintains acid-base and electrolyte balance compared with NS especially during the postreperfusion period.",

        "Abstract":"BACKGROUND: Acute kidney injury (AKI) has been recognized as one of the most complex clinical complications in modern medicine, and ischemia\/reperfusion (I\/R) injury is well-known as a main reason of AKI. In addition, AKI leads to important systemic consequences such as acute lung injury. This study was designed to investigate the role of erythropoietin (EPO) on kidney function makers and tissue damage; and lung endothelial permeability and lung water content (LWC) in bilateral renal I\/R injury model in rats.\nMETHODS: Male Wistar rats were randomly divided into three groups of sham, I\/R, and I\/R treated with EPO (I\/R + EPO) groups. The I\/R and I\/R + EPO groups were subjected to bilateral renal I\/R injury; however, only the I\/R + EPO group received EPO (500 IU\/kg, i.p.) 2 h before ischemia surgery, and the same dose was continued once a day for 3 days after ischemia. The sham group underwent a surgical procedure without ischemia process.\nRESULTS: The blood urea nitrogen (BUN) and serum creatinine (Cr) levels, kidney tissue damage score (KTDS), and kidney weight (KW) per 100 g body weight significantly increased in I\/R group (P < 0.05). EPO administration decreased levels of BUN and Cr significantly (P < 0.05), and KTDS and KW insignificantly (P = 0.1). No significant differences in kidney and serum levels of malondialdehyde, and lung vascular permeability and LWC were observed between the groups. The serum and kidney levels of nitrite were not significantly different between I\/R and sham groups; however, administration of EPO increased the renal level of nitrite (P < 0.05).\nCONCLUSIONS: EPO protected the kidney against I\/R injury; however, it may not protect the lung tissue from the damage induced by renal I\/R injury in rats.",

        "Abstract":"BACKGROUND: Guidelines for recommended medication use for the secondary prevention of coronary heart disease are exceedingly important in patients with chronic kidney disease. Despite a high risk for recurrent cardiovascular events, these patients are less likely to use evidence-based recommended medications. The objective of the current study was to analyze the association between renal function and guideline-recommended drug therapy in patients with coronary heart disease.\nMETHODS: In this nationwide population-based cohort study, we included 12,332 patients with established coronary heart disease who underwent primary isolated coronary artery bypass grafting in Sweden between 2005 and 2008. Medication use was retrieved from the national Prescribed Drug Register.\nRESULTS: During the first year after coronary surgery, 94% of patients had at least two dispensed prescriptions for an antiplatelet agent, 68% for an angiotensin-converting enzyme inhibitor or angiotensin II receptor blocker, 92% for a beta-blocker, and 93% for a statin. Only 57% of all patients had prescriptions for all four medication classes. Reduced renal function (estimated glomerular filtration rate (eGFR) of 30 to 45 mL\/min per 1.73 m(2) and <30 mL\/min per 1.73 m(2)) was significantly associated with a lower use of all four medication classes (adjusted risk ratio 0.89, 95% confidence interval 0.82 to 0.98; and adjusted risk ratio 0.75, 95% confidence interval 0.62 to 0.90, respectively) as compared to normal renal function (eGFR >60 mL\/min per 1.73 m(2)).\nCONCLUSIONS: In patients with established coronary heart disease, moderate to severe renal dysfunction was associated with significantly lower use of guideline-recommend medications as compared to normal renal function.",

In this case report, a 67-year old male with a positive history for atrial fibrillation, coronary artery disease, intermittent angina, hypertension, type 2 diabetes and normal renal function was taking dabigatran 150 mg, 2 times daily. He underwent 8 surgical extractions, alveoloplasty and tuberosity reduction. Per guidelines prescribed by van Ryn et al., the patient's dabigatran was held the night before surgery and resumed the day after. Adverse outcomes were not observed during the procedure or in the 7-month postoperative period.

        "Abstract":"BACKGROUND: Patients on chronic hemodialysis (HD) are recognized as a high-risk group for adverse events after percutaneous coronary intervention, and whether drug-eluting stents (DES) are associated with improved outcomes over bare metal stents (BMS) is still uncertain. The purpose of this study was to assess the efficacy of DES compared with BMS at short- and long-term follow-up (FU) in an unselected sample of HD patients.\nMETHODS AND RESULTS: In the time period 2005-2010, consecutive patients on chronic HD treated with percutaneous coronary intervention (PCI) and stent implantation were retrospectively selected and analyzed. A total of 169 patients were selected, 77 treated exclusively with BMS and 92 exclusively with DES. Baseline clinical characteristics were similar in the 2 groups as well as the number of treated vessels, treated lesions, and the stent per patient ratio. At longest available FU, no difference between the 2 study groups was found in terms of cardiac death (18.2% vs 16.3%, P=0.83), myocardial infarction (2.5% vs 8.6%, P=0.09), cerebrovascular accidents (0% vs 1.1%, P=0.98), and target vessel revascularization (TVR) (9.1% vs 16.3%, P=0.17). Major adverse cardiac and cerebrovascular events-free survival at 1,500 days in the BMS and DES groups was 57.6% and 50.9% (P=0.11), respectively.\nCONCLUSIONS: PCI in patients on chronic HD treatment is associated with a high incidence of adverse events at FU, mainly represented by death. In our study, the use of DES was not associated with a reduction of target lesion revascularization (TLR) and TVR.",

        "Published":"2013-02-28",
        "Abstract":"The purpose of this article is to summarize the current knowledge about treatment with oral platelet inhibitors in patients with acute coronary syndrome (ACS). Antiplatelet therapy has been shown to improve the prognosis of patients with ACS with ST segment elevation myocardial infarction (STEMI) and non-ST segment elevation ACS (NSTE-ACS). Aspirin should be given with a loading dose of 250-500 mg, followed by 75-100 mg\/day. Dual antiplatelet therapy is recommended for all patients with ACS for 12 months regardless of the initial revascularization strategy. Clopidogrel should be administered at first medical contact in STEMI with a loading dose of 600 mg. In patients with ACS and percutaneous coronary intervention (PCI) 2 × 75 mg clopidogrel should be given daily over 7 days, while in all other patients 75 mg per day appears to be sufficient. The two newer adenosine diphosphate-receptor antagonists prasugrel and ticagrelor lead to a more rapid and effective inhibition of platelet aggregation compared with clopidogrel, which was associated with an improved clinical outcome in two large randomized studies. Prasugrel is indicated in patients with ACS undergoing PCI and was most effective in diabetics and in patients with STEMI. In the recent TaRgeted platelet Inhibition to cLarify the Optimal strateGy to medicallY manage Acute Coronary Syndromes trial in medically treated patients with NSTE-ACS, prasugrel did not significantly reduce ischemic events compared with clopidogrel. Ticagrelor has been studied in the whole spectrum of ACS patients and reduced cardiovascular and total mortality in comparison with clopidogrel. The greatest benefit has been observed in patients with planned conservative treatment and in patients with impaired renal function. Expanding antiplatelet therapy from dual to triple therapy including a platelet thrombin receptor antagonist in the thrombin receptor antagonist for clinical event reduction in acute coronary syndrome trial was not associated with a significant reduction in the primary combined endpoint but an increase in bleeding complications. However, in the Thrombin Receptor Antagonist in Secondary Prevention of atherothrombotic ischemic events study in patients with prior myocardial infarction, vorapaxar on top of standard antiplatelet therapy was effective.",

        "Abstract":"BACKGROUND: This study investigated the efficacy of human atrial natriuretic peptide (hANP, carperitide) for high-risk patients undergoing coronary artery bypass grafting (CABG).\nMETHODS: This was a randomized controlled trial of 367 high-risk patients (European System for Cardiac Operative Risk Evaluation above 6) undergoing CABG. The primary endpoint was major adverse cardiovascular and cerebrovascular events (MACCE). Secondary endpoints were (1) postoperative death, (2) MACCE + hemodialysis, and (3) serum creatinine and brain natriuretic peptide (BNP) levels. Logistic regression analysis was conducted to identify preoperative and perioperative factors related to early death and MACCE.\nRESULTS: There was no significant difference of survival between the hANP and placebo groups (p = 0.1651), but the MACCE-free rate was significantly higher in the hANP group than in the placebo group (p < 0.0001). No patient from the hANP group started hemodialysis after operation, but 7 patients did in the placebo group, and the dialysis rate was significantly lower in the hANP group (p = 0.0147). Serum creatinine and BNP were also significantly lower in the hANP group at 1 year postoperatively. MACCE were strongly associated with age 75 years or older, chronic kidney disease, hemodialysis, left ventricular dysfunction, and nonuse of carperitide.\nCONCLUSIONS: In the early postoperative period, carperitide has a cardiorenal protective effect that prevents postoperative MACCE and hemodialysis. Perioperative low-dose carperitide infusion may be useful in high-risk patients undergoing on-pump CABG.",

        "Abstract":"OBJECTIVES: Acute kidney injury (AKI) is one of the most frequently occurring complications after off-pump coronary artery bypass graft (OPCAB). Hyperglycaemia is a major, potentially modifiable risk factor of adverse outcome after cardiac surgery known to aggravate organ damage. The aim of this study was to address the association between intraoperative glucose concentration and postoperative AKI in patients who underwent OPCAB.\nMETHODS: The medical records of 880 consecutive patients were retrospectively reviewed. Patients were divided into three groups according to the time-weighted average of intraoperative glucose concentrations (<110, 110-150 and >150 mg\/dl), and the incidence of AKI (increase of serum creatinine to >2.0 mg\/dl and 2 × most recent preoperative value or a new requirement for dialysis) was compared. Multivariate logistic regression analysis was performed to identify independent risk factors for postoperative AKI.\nRESULTS: The incidence of AKI was higher in patients with a glucose level >150 mg\/dl than in patients with a glucose level = 110-150 mg\/dl [8% (20 of 251) vs 3% (14 of 453), P = 0.004].

We prospectively followed a group of patients for four years who underwent coronary computed tomography angiography (CCTA) for major adverse cardiac events (MACE). We hypothesized that the results of this trial would reliably reflect the natural outcome of the coronary disease.\nMETHODS: Consecutive patients who underwent CCTA from June 2008 to May 2009 were selected. Those who could not be reached by telephone, had significant angina, had CT images that were not interpretable, or poor kidney and left ventricular (LV) function were excluded. The patients were divided into five groups: group A normal CCTA without stenosis, group B mild stenosis (1% - 49%), group C moderate stenosis (50% - 74%), group D severe stenosis (= 75%) and they were treated with optimal medical therapy (OMT) or PCI. The group E had PCI before the CCTA examination. The patients were then followed for MACE after different treatments. MACE included acute myocardial infarction (MI), heart failure (HF) and death.\nRESULTS: The patient population consisted of 419 patients. The follow-up time was (51 ± 5) months. The age was (60 ± 31) years. Male made up 67.78% of the population (n = 284). A total of 51 cases of MACE occurred including 25 MI, eight HF and 18 all-cause deaths. There was no MACE in group A. Although MACE occurred in two patients in group B, they were not attributed to cardiac death. We further compared the MACE in groups C-E and no significant difference was found (P > 0.05). However, a difference was detected among patients with unstable angina pectoris (UAP), stable angina pectoris (SAP), re-hospitalization, and cerebrovascular events from groups A-E (P < 0.05). The plaque scores were used to predict MACE. The scores progressively increased significantly with lesion severity (P < 0.05). Receiver operating curve (ROC) was performed to determine the sensitivity and specificity in predicting MACE. Our scores predicted MI with area of 0.76, predicted HF with area of 0.77, and predicted death with area of 0.70.\nCONCLUSIONS: Normal and mild lesions had very few events. With increased stenosis the MACE rate increased progressively. PCI did not significantly reduce the MACE in comparison with OMT in asymptomatic patients. Furthermore, UAP, re-hospitalization, and re-PCI were significantly increased in patients who were treated with PCI.",

All data of patients with post CABG admitted to the Department of Critical Care Medicine of the First People's Hospital in Yichang from January 2008 to January 2012 were retrospectively analyzed. The CABG patients staying in ICU more than 3 days served as observation group, and the patients staying in ICU less than 3 days were the control group. Potential risk factors in both groups were compared, and multivariable non-condition logistic regressions analysis was adopted to determine the independent risk factors which resulted in prolonged stay in ICU after CABG.\nRESULTS: Sixty-eight patients underwent CABG were analyzed retrospectively. Twenty-four cases (35.29%) had prolonged stay in ICU after CABG. Univariate analysis showed that the risk factors of prolonged stay in ICU after CABG were low cardiac output, arrhythmia, postoperative respiratory failure, postoperative acute renal failure, emergency operation, and left atrial inner diameter. The multivariable logistic regression analysis showed that the independent risk factor of prolonged stay in ICU after CABG was the postoperative respiratory failure [odds ratio (OR)=6.856, 95% confidence interval (95%CI) 1.322 - 35.559, P<0.05].\nCONCLUSIONS: The independent risk factor of prolonged stay in ICU after CABG was postoperative respiratory failure.

The X-ray of the spine detected an unspecific sclerotic lesion of the third lumbar vertebra; an abdominal computed tomography (CT) scan was performed. In this scan, a sheeting of the infrarenal abdominal aorta, a streaky densification of the periaortal fatty tissue, and a nearly complete thrombotic occlusion of the inferior vena cava and both iliac veins was detected. As these findings are typical for acute aortitis and this is a life-threatening disease, the patient was transferred to a university hospital. Imaging work-up including ultrasound, magnetic resonance imaging, and 18-flourodeoxyglucose positron emission tomography were performed after transfer. These examinations showed acute aortitis due to Ormond's disease. Furthermore, there was a thrombotic occlusion of the inferior vena cava due to a compression of the vein by inflamed connective tissue. This is a rare finding in Ormond's disease. We decided to treat our patient with a combined therapy including glucocorticoids and tamoxifen for 2 years. During these 2 years and the further follow-up period, the patient showed no relapse of the inflammatory disease. Retroperitoneal fibrosis is a rare but increasingly recognized disease characterized by the presence of fibro-inflammatory tissue, usually surrounding the abdominal aorta and the iliac arteries. This fibrotic tissue extends into the retroperitoneum and thus encases structures, for example, the ureters. Retroperitoneal fibrosis is generally idiopathic. It can also be secondary to certain drugs, malignant diseases, infections, surgery, and other triggering factors. Ormond's disease may lead to serious complications like renal failure.

Pentoxifylline (PTX) with a variety of mechanisms may prevent CIN.\nMATERIALS AND METHODS: Between April 5, 2011, and February 20, 2012, all consecutive eligible patients referred for elective percutaneous coronary intervention were asked to participate in the study (n = 199). Eligibility was defined as the age between 18 and 65 years and baseline serum creatinine ≤ 132.6 μmol\/l (1.5 mg\/dl). The patients were randomly allocated to two groups either receiving saline or saline plus pentoxifylline 400 mg orally three times a day for 48 h. Serum creatinine was measured 24 h prior to the procedure and 48 h thereafter. The primary endpoint was occurrence of CIN defined as 25 % rise in serum creatinine 48 h after the procedure.\nRESULTS: The overall incidence of CIN was 6 % in this study (6.2 % in the PTX group versus 5.9 % in the hydration group, P = 0.92). Absolute rise in serum creatinine was not also significantly different between the two groups (P = 0.97). In hypertensive patients, however, the incidence of CIN was lower among those receiving PTX: 5 % in the PTX group versus 8.7 % in the hydration group. Nevertheless, this difference was not statistically significant (P = 0.68).\nCONCLUSION: Short-term prophylaxis with pentoxifylline added to optimal hydration does not seem to reduce the risk of CIN in patients with normal renal function undergoing PCI.

Cox analysis showed the positive predictors for 30 days and 1 year mortality were heart failure, cerebral vascular disease, chronic renal failure, ventricular tachycardia\/ventricular fibrillation, age, female, gastric intestinal bleeding, cardiogenic shock, multiple organ failure, while PCI was a negative predictor. ROCs analysis showed AUCs were always higher for PCI group.\nCONCLUSIONS: The elderly have more comorbidities and higher rates of mortality, mandating thorough evaluation before acceptance for PCI. PCI between 12 hours to 28 days in all ages of patients including the elderly with STEMI is significantly more effective than conservative therapy.",

In this study we evaluated the benefits of adding aspirin (A) to BB and S (ABBS), with\/without angiotensin-converting enzyme inhibitor (ACE-I) on postoperative outcome in high-risk patients undergoing major vascular surgery.\nMETHODS: Analysis of consecutive patients undergoing elective vascular surgery at the University of Michigan Cardiovascular Center was performed. Univariate and multivariate analyses were done using cardiac risk index [Revised Cardiac Risk Index (RCRI), coronary artery disease (CAD), insulin-dependent diabetes mellitus (IDDM), cerebral vascular disease, renal dysfunction, congestive heart failure, and major surgery]; pulmonary disease; and A, BB, S (ABBS)±ACE-I use. Baseline clinical characteristics and medication were adjusted using propensity scores. Endpoints were bleeding, 30-day MI, stroke, and 12-month mortality.\nRESULTS: Between 2003 and 2010, 4,149 arterial procedures were performed, 819 of which were risk stratified as RCRI≥3. The incidence of MI was 3-fold lower (2.5% vs. 7.8%, OR 0.31, 95% CI 0.15-0.61, P=0.001) in ABBS±ACE-I (n=513) as compared with non-ABBS±ACE-I (n=306). The 12-month mortality was 8-fold lower in ABBS±ACE-I as compared non-ABBS±ACE-I (5.9% vs. 37.5%, HR 0.13, 95% CI 0.08-0.20, P<0.0001). After adjustment for the propensity to use various therapies, A (HR 0.35, 95% CI 0.24-0.53, P<0.0001), BB (HR 0.65, 95% CI 0.43-1.0, P=0.05), and S (HR 0.36, 95% CI 0.25-0.53, P<0.0001) remained associated with improved 12-month survival. ACE-I use (HR 0.80, 95% CI 0.54-1.19, P=0.27) was not predictive. Aspirin did not predict severe\/moderate bleeding.\nCONCLUSIONS: In high-risk patients undergoing major vascular surgery, ABBS therapy has superior 30-day and 12-month risk reduction benefits for MI, stroke, and mortality as compared with A, BB, or S independently.

        "Abstract":"OBJECTIVES: Repair of either the mitral (M) or tricuspid (T) valve in single valve surgery is associated with reduced operative mortality. It is unclear, however, how valve repair influences mortality in combined MT procedures. This topic was evaluated in the Society of Thoracic Surgeons database.\nMETHODS: From 1993 through 2007, 21 056 patients underwent concomitant MT valve surgery. Group I had M&T replacement (n = 1130), Group II had M repair and T replacement (n = 216), Group III had M replacement and T repair (n = 11 448) and Group IV had both M&T repair (n = 8262). Unadjusted operative mortalities (UOMs) and morbidities of Groups I-IV were assessed, and logistic regression analysis adjusted for differences in baseline patient profiles. Surgical outcomes were expressed as UOMs, and also adjusted odds ratios (ORs) for mortality.\nRESULTS: Group IV was older with more coronary artery bypass grafting and generally less comorbidity, and Group I had more endocarditis, mitral stenosis and reoperation. UOM values were: Group I = 16.8, Group II = 10.2, Group III = 10.3 and Group IV = 8.0%. In the multivariable model, factors influencing mortality included: age (per 5-year increase, OR = 1.15), renal failure with dialysis (OR = 3.22), emergency status (OR = 3.14), second or more reoperations (OR = 1.92) and later surgical date (OR = 0.63). Both M and T repair were independently associated with lower operative mortalities vs prosthetic valve replacement (OR = 0.83 and 0.60, respectively, P < 0.003).\nCONCLUSIONS: In MT double valve surgery, repair of either valve is associated with lower risk-adjusted mortality when compared with replacement and, when feasible, multiple valve repair should be considered the optimal treatment. Within the limitations of observational analysis, these data support continued efforts to increase M&T repair rates.",

However, the long-term clinical outcomes of patients with PVD undergoing PCI in the contemporary drug-eluting stent (DES) era have not been well characterized.\nMETHODS: The 2004\/2005 Cornell Angioplasty Registry database was used to evaluate the in-hospital and long-term clinical outcomes in patients undergoing non-emergent (urgent or elective) PCI. A total of 2455 study patients were examined. We excluded patients presenting with an ST-elevation myocardial infarction (MI) ≤ 24 hours, hemodynamic instability\/shock, thrombolytic therapy ≤ 7 days, or renal insufficiency (creatinine ≥ 4 mg\/dL). Mean clinical follow-up was 4.4 ± 1.1 years.\nRESULTS: Of the 2455 patients, a total of 173 (7%) had PVD and 2282 (93%) had no reported history of PVD. DESs were used in 87% of the PCIs. The incidence of in-hospital death (1.8% vs 0.1%; P=.006) was greater in the PVD group, whereas postprocedural MI (6.4% vs 6.8%; P=.810) and major adverse cardiovascular event rates including death, stroke, emergent coronary artery bypass graft\/PCI, and MI (8.7% vs 7.0%; P=.360) were similar in the PVD versus no PVD groups. Long-term Kaplan-Meier survival (89.2% vs 76.2%; P<.001) was significantly higher in patients without PVD versus with PVD, respectively. After adjustment with a multivariate Cox regression analysis, long-term all-cause survival was similar in patients with versus without PVD (hazard ratio, 1.16; 95% confidence interval, 0.69-1.93; P=.581).\nCONCLUSIONS: In contemporary PCI utilizing DESs, glycoprotein IIb\/IIIa inhibitors, and clopidogrel, PVD is associated with a higher in-hospital and 4-year all-cause mortality. In our study, this difference in long-term survival was mainly driven by a higher rate of comorbidities in the PVD population that underwent PCI.",

In an a priori planned secondary analysis, outcomes were evaluated according to renal function defined by estimated glomerular filtration rates (eGFR; normal: eGFR ≥ 60 ml\/min\/1.73 m(2); CKD: eGFR<60 ml\/min\/1.73 m(2)). The primary endpoint was the first major adverse cardiac event (MACE: cardiac death, myocardial infarction, target vessel revascularisation) up to 2 years. A Cox proportional-hazard model was used to evaluate adjusted relative risks (hazard rates, HRs) for BMS versus DES. The interaction of stent type and renal function was tested. CKD patients (189 (11.2%)\/1681 with such data) had a 2-year MACE rate of 8.5% versus 7.4% in those without CKD [HR 0.98 (0.56-1.72), p=0.95] with cardiac mortalities of 5.3% and 1.5%, respectively (p=0.002, non-significant after baseline adjustments).

We sought to compare the long-term performance of everolimus-eluting stents (EES) and Endeavor zotarolimus-eluting stents (E-ZES) in STEMI.\nMETHODS AND RESULTS: The current analysis of a prospective registry included consecutive patients treated with EES or E-ZES for STEMI. Adjustment for measured confounders was done using Cox regression. In total, 931 patients met the inclusion criteria (412 EES and 519 E-ZES). Baseline characteristics were balanced, apart from a lower rate of renal insufficiency in EES. Median follow-up duration was 2.4 years (IQR 1.6-3.1). Mortality outcomes were similar. Up to three-year follow-up, the composite endpoint of cardiac death, target vessel-related myocardial infarction and target lesion revascularisation (TLR) was lower in EES; 9.7% vs. 13.7% in E-ZES (HR 0.64, 95% CI: 0.42-0.99), primarily driven by reduced TLR rates; 3.4% in EES vs. 7.3% in E-ZES (HR 0.46, 95% CI: 0.23-0.92). Definite stent thrombosis rates were low and similar between groups (1.1% in EES vs. 1.9% in E-ZES, p=0.190).\nCONCLUSIONS: Use of EES led to lower rates of the composite endpoint, driven by reduced TLR. This suggests that EES are more efficacious than Endeavor ZES in STEMI. Definite ST rates were low, and the strategy of second-generation DES implantation and the administration of upfront GP IIb\/IIIa inhibitors appear to be safe in STEMI.",

We analyzed the prognostic implications of an elevated white blood cell count (WBCc) in patients with moderate and high-risk non-ST-segment elevation acute coronary syndrome undergoing an early invasive strategy in the large-scale Acute Catheterization and Urgent Intervention Triage StrategY trial. The WBCc at admission was available for 13,678 of 13,819 patients (98.9%). The patients in the upper tertile of the WBCc had an increased risk of 30-day major bleeding, 1-year mortality, and definite\/probable stent thrombosis compared to those in the mid or lower tertiles. On multivariate analysis, the WBCc was an independent predictor of 30-day major bleeding and 1-year cardiac, noncardiac, and all-cause mortality. The association between the WBCc and cardiac mortality was present in multiple prespecified subgroups, with no significant interaction between the WBCc and age, gender, diabetes, smoking, renal dysfunction, elevated baseline biomarkers, antithrombotic therapy, revascularization, and Thrombolysis In Myocardial Infarction risk score. The WBCc remained an independent predictor of mortality after adjusting for bleeding, C-reactive protein level, and angiographic variables, including left ventricular ejection fraction, Thrombolysis In Myocardial Infarction flow, and number of diseased vessels. The WBCc significantly improved the prognostic accuracy of the Thrombolysis In Myocardial Infarction risk score, with a net reclassification improvement of 11% (p <0.0001). In conclusion, in patients with moderate- and high-risk non-ST-segment elevation acute coronary syndrome, an elevated admission WBCc was an independent predictor of 30-day major bleeding, and 1-year cardiac, noncardiac, and all-cause mortality.",

One approach is the systemic application of prostaglandins, which were demonstrated to be beneficial in reducing ischemia-reperfusion injury. Preliminary data indicate a positive effect of prostacyclin analogue iloprost on allograft viability after liver transplantation.

Study population was consisted of three subgroups according to prior usage of RAAS blockers: no RAAS blocker group (n=95), angiotensin-converting enzyme inhibitor (ACEI) group (n=106), angiotensin receptor blocker (ARB) group (n=94). CIN was defined as an increase of ≥25% in creatinine over the baseline value or 0.5 mg\/dL rise within 48-72 h of angiography. Mehran score was calculated for each patient. Baseline variables and percentage of CIN were compared with ANOVA, Mann-Whitney U, Kruskal-Wallis and Pearson Chi-square tests between groups. In order to determine the independent predictors of CIN, binary logistic regression analyses were performed.\nRESULTS: CIN occurred in 18 patients (17.0%) in the ACEI group, 17 patients (18.1%) in ARB group and 7 patients (7.4%) in the no RAAS group. CIN occurrence was significantly higher in RAAS than no RAAS group (17.5% vs. 7.4%, p=0.01). Chronic RAAS blocker administration was an independent predictor of CIN (OR=2.69; 95% CI: 1.025-7.067; p=0.04). Mehran score was the only other independent predictor for CIN (OR=1.15; 95% CI: 1.019-1.310; p=0.02).\nCONCLUSION: In patients with near normal renal functions who are undergoing elective coronary procedure, chronic usage of ACEI and ARB increases the risk of CIN.",

        "Abstract":"OBJECTIVE: The purpose of this study was to describe the various CT findings of isolated spontaneous splanchnic artery dissection and the treatment options and outcomes.\nMATERIALS AND METHODS: From January 1999 to May 2008, splanchnic artery dissection was diagnosed through CT angiography in 34 patients (28 men, six women) without recent trauma or aortic disease. All patients were classified as having either symptomatic (n = 19) or asymptomatic (n = 15) dissection. We analyzed imaging findings of intimal flap, aneurysmal dilatation, thrombosed false lumen, periarterial fatty infiltration, branch vessel involvement, bowel ischemic signs, and the extent of involvement of each artery with each treatment method and the outcomes.\nRESULTS: Intimal flap (n = 37 [88.1%]; symptomatic, 22; asymptomatic, 15), thrombosed false lumen (n = 27 [64.3%]; symptomatic, 19; asymptomatic, 8), and aneurysmal dilatation (n = 22 [52.4%]; symptomatic, 14; asymptomatic, 8) were seen. Periarterial fatty infiltration and branch vessel involvement differed between the symptomatic and asymptomatic groups (p < 0.01). Renal artery dissection was found in six patients (symptomatic, 3; asymptomatic, 3). Six patients were lost to follow-up. Treatments included conservative management without anticoagulation therapy (n = 19; symptomatic, 8; asymptomatic, 11), endovascular stent insertions (n = 6; symptomatic, 6; asymptomatic, 0), and surgery (n = 3; symptomatic, 3; asymptomatic, 0). Patients with a follow-up interval of more than 10 days had disease in a stationary state (n = 14; symptomatic, 4; asymptomatic, 10), were in improved condition (n = 12; symptomatic, 11; asymptomatic, 1), or had progression of disease (n = 2; symptomatic, 2; asymptomatic, 0).\nCONCLUSION: Intimal flap, thrombosed false lumen, and aneurysmal dilatation are the most common CT findings of spontaneous splanchnic artery dissection. In splanchnic artery dissection, conservative management without anticoagulation had good outcome except in patients with bowel ischemia, aneurysmal dilatation three times larger than a normal segment, or progression of dissection.",

We assessed in-patient outcomes in elderly patients undergoing contemporary primary PCI (PPCI).\nMETHODS AND RESULTS: From Sept 2005 to July 2011 patients undergoing PPCI in our centre were identified. Demographic details, procedural data and in-patient outcomes were collated. Those aged ≥80 years were compared with those aged <80 years. In the study period 1,218 patients required PPCI, of which 224(18.4%) were ≥80 years. The elderly cohort were more likely to be female (44.3% vs. 20.3%; p<0.001), and have significant comorbidities. Times from first medical contact until TIMI 3 flow were similar between the two groups (medien 102 min vs. 109 min; p=0.19). There was no difference in rates of PCI success (97.3% vs. 98.3%; p=0.24), drug-eluting stent use (63.5% vs. 63.3%; p=1.00) and number of stents used. In-patient outcomes were worse in the elderly cohort with significantly higher rates of death (11.2% vs. 3.7%; p<0.001) and acute kidney injury (12.9% vs. 4.0%; p<0.001), with a trend towards more post-procedure cardiovascular accidents (CVA), access site complications and reinfarction. Length of stay was significantly longer in the elderly cohort (median days 5 vs. 3; p<0.001).\nCONCLUSIONS: Important demographic differences exist in very elderly patients presenting with STEMI compared to younger patients though procedural data and PCI success rates are similar between the two groups. Those aged ≥80 years have significantly worse in-patient outcomes though death rates are not as high as historical data suggests.",

Efficacy of second-generation drug-eluting stents in this setting remains less well defined. This study compared 3-year clinical outcomes after treatment of BMS ISR using second-generation everolimus-eluting stents (EES) to first-generation paclitaxel-eluting stents (PES) or sirolimus-eluting stents (SES).\nMETHODS: This was a retrospective observational study. A total of 264 consecutive patients with BMS ISR underwent percutaneous coronary intervention using EES (75 patients), PES (95 patients), or SES (94 patients) from 2003 to 2009. The primary endpoint of the study was survival free of major adverse cardiac events (MACE) at 3 years. Secondary endpoints were survival free of need for revascularization of the target lesion and definite stent thrombosis. Clinical follow-up could be obtained in 99% of patients.\nRESULTS: Baseline clinical and angiographic parameters were comparable between the three groups. MACE at the 3-year follow-up were 27, 30, and 27%, for the EES, PES, and SES groups, respectively (P=0.874). The target lesion revascularization rates for EES, PES, and SES groups were 15, 20, and 23%, respectively (P=0.429). Rates of definite stent thrombosis at the 3-year follow-up were comparable between the three groups at 0, 2.1, and 1.0%, respectively (P=0.437). Rates of myocardial infarction and death were also similar between the three groups. Diabetes mellitus was the only independent predictor of MACE at the 3-year follow-up (odds ratio=1.14, 95% confidence interval 1.00-1.30; P=0.038), whereas renal insufficiency was the only independent predictor for death (odds ratio=1.10, 95% confidence interval 0.850-1.274; P=0.011).\nCONCLUSION: Second-generation EES is as effective and safe as the first-generation PES or SES in the treatment of BMS ISR.

In this study, we hypothesized that angiographic LL between 0.3 and 0.6 mm correlate with favorable long-term clinical outcomes.\nMATERIALS AND METHODS: Patients were enrolled in the present study if they had undergone both DES implantation in single coronary vessel and a subsequent follow-up angiogram (n=634). These individuals were then subdivided into three groups based on their relative angiographic LL: group I (angiographic LL <0.3 mm, n=378), group II (angiographic LL between 0.3 and 0.6 mm, n=124), and group III (angiographic LL >0.6 mm, n=134). During a 5-year follow-up period, all subjects were tracked for critical events, defined as any cause of death or myocardial infarction, which were then compared among the three groups.\nRESULTS: Mean follow-up duration was 63.0 ± 10.0 months. Critical events occurred in 25 subjects in group I (6.6%), 5 in group II (4.0%), and 17 in group III (12.7%), (p=0.020; group I vs. group II, p=0.293; group II vs. group III, p=0.013).

Patients treated with prasugrel had fewer ischemic events but more procedure-related bleeding. In the present study, we aimed to determine the effect of bivalirudin on bleeding in patients treated with prasugrel. A total of 692 patients with consecutive acute coronary syndrome underwent PCI with stent implantation and were anticoagulated with bivalirudin. The patients were divided into 2 groups according to the antiplatelet regimen (clopidogrel or prasugrel) chosen during or just after PCI. The bleeding complications during hospitalization were tabulated. Ischemic events were analyzed during hospitalization and at 30 days. Prasugrel was used in 96 patients (13.9%) and clopidogrel in 596 (86.1%). The clinical and procedural characteristics were similar, although the clopidogrel patients more often reported systemic hypertension (p = 0.01), previous PCI (p <0.001), and chronic renal insufficiency (p = 0.05). During hospitalization, the bleeding and ischemic complication rates were similar and low in both groups (major in-hospital complications 4.2% for clopidogrel vs 2.1% for prasugrel, p = 0.6; Thrombolysis In Myocardial Infarction major bleeding 2.5% vs 2.1%, p = 1.00; Thrombolysis In Myocardial Infarction minor bleeding 4.2% vs 5.2%, p = 0.6). At 30 days, no differences were found in ischemic events between both groups (target vessel revascularization\/major adverse cardiac events 5.4% vs 2.1%, p = 0.2). In conclusion, prasugrel, when given after bivalirudin as the intraprocedural antithrombin agent for patients with acute coronary syndrome undergoing PCI, is as safe and effective as clopidogrel.",

A phase II trial in acute coronary syndromes (ACS) showed a marked reduction in the combined end point of death or myocardial infarction (MI) and similar bleeding rates with otamixaban at midrange doses, compared with unfractionated heparin (UFH) and eptifibatide.\nDESIGN: The TAO trial is a phase III, randomized, double-blind, triple-dummy controlled trial testing the efficacy of otamixaban over UFH plus eptifibatide in patients with non-ST-segment elevation ACS to be treated with dual oral antiplatelet therapy and an invasive strategy. Approximately 13,220 patients in 55 countries will be randomized (1:1:1 ratio) to receive UFH plus downstream eptifibatide (started pre-percutaneous coronary intervention and continued per label) or otamixaban (0.08 mg\/kg intravenous bolus at randomization then 0.100 or 0.140 mg\/kg per hour intravenous infusion). An interim analysis was performed after ≥1,969 patients per arm completed 7 days of follow-up and the Data Monitoring Committee selected 1 otamixaban dose (blinded to investigators) to be carried forward using a prespecified algorithm. The primary efficacy outcome is the composite of all-cause mortality or new MI through day 7. The primary safety outcome is thrombolysis in MI major or minor bleeding through day 7. Secondary outcomes include all-cause mortality, recurrent ischemia\/infarction resulting in prolonged\/recurrent hospitalization, periprocedural angiographic complications, and pharmacokinetic data in 6,000 patients.\nCONCLUSIONS: The TAO trial will assess the clinical efficacy and safety of otamixaban in non-ST-segment elevation ACS with planned invasive strategy.",

Patients who received only DES were compared to those who received only BMS. The primary end-point was the long-term rate of major adverse cardiac events (MACE, i.e. the composite of death, myocardial infarction and repeat revascularization).\nRESULTS: We included a total of 219 patients with CKD out of a total of 2354 patients, with 164 receiving BMS and 55 DES. After a mean follow up of 48 months, the MACE rate was significantly higher in BMS group (71% versus 38%, P<0.001). A similarly increased risk with BMS was found for death (45% versus 17%, P<0.001), whereas the rates for repeat coronary revascularization, myocardial infarction and stent thrombosis were not significantly different. Multivariable analysis showed that BMS vs.. DES implantation was not statistically significant associated with MACE, death, myocardial infarction, rePTCA or stent thrombosis.\nCONCLUSION: Compared with BMS, use of DES in patients with CKD is safe and effective in reducing adverse outcomes.

Aim of our study was to compare efficacy of conservative therapy with drugs of proven effect on prognosis and of percutaneous coronary interventions in combination with optimal drug therapy in patients with stable ischemic heart disease (IHD) during 5 years of follow up. We included into this study 503 patients (387 men and 116 women, mean age 59 years). Groups of conservative and invasive treatments comprised 179 and 302 patients, respectively; mean durations of follow-up were 5.6+\/-1.3 and 4.1+\/-1.6 years, respectively, p=0.001.

        "Abstract":"OBJECTIVE: Cardiac surgery patients are treated with antifibrinolytic agents to reduce intra- and postoperative bleeding. Until 2007, lysine analogues (aminocaproic acid and tranexamic acid) and serine protease inhibitors (aprotinin) were recommended. In 2008, the U.S. Food and Drug Administration prohibited aprotinin use because of associated postoperative complications, including cerebrovascular accidents and renal failure. This work aimed at reevaluating the efficacy and safety of aprotinin versus tranexamic acid in patients undergoing elective coronary artery bypass surgery.\nMETHODS: Two groups were enrolled in this study. Group A (n = 256), operated from January 2005 to August 2007, was treated with the half-Hammersmith aprotinin regime whereas group B (n = 104), operated after 2008, was treated with the full-dose tranexamic acid regime. All patients were of low-risk profile, and underwent an elective, on-pump coronary artery bypass surgery. The main outcome measures were safety, assessed in relation to thrombosis-related cardiac, cerebral, and renal events; and efficacy, investigated in terms of postoperative bleeding and infusions of blood products.\nRESULTS: Postoperatively, group B demonstrated greater bleeding during the operative and first postoperative days, and total bleeding (P values ≤ .001); a greater requirement of blood and\/or blood products infusions (P = .024); higher postoperative acute renal failure rates (P = .028); lower platelet count (P = .002); and a higher postoperative increase in troponin levels (P < .0001).\nCONCLUSIONS: Among low-risk patients undergoing coronary artery bypass surgery, the half-Hammersmith aprotinin-based antifibrinolytic management proved to be more efficacious in terms of bleeding and consumption of blood products, with no evidence of associated increased rates of postoperative complications. Accordingly, the usage of aprotinin should be reconsidered for treatment among cohorts of low-risk cardiac patients.",

        "Abstract":"Patients undergoing chronic hemodialysis (HD) are at high risk of restenosis and cardiac events after percutaneous coronary intervention (PCI). This study compared the clinical efficacy of sirolimus-eluting stents (SES) and paclitaxel-eluting stents (PES) in patients undergoing HD. Between June 2004 and January 2010, the clinical outcomes of 41 consecutive patients on HD who underwent PCI with SES (62 lesions) were compared with those of 38 consecutive patients on HD who underwent PCI with PES (54 lesions). Patient and lesion characteristics were similar between both groups. The target lesion revascularization (TLR) (SES 36.6 % vs. PES 15.8 %; P = 0.037) was significantly higher with SES (36.6 %) than with PES (15.8 %) (P = 0.037), particularly in the context of severe calcified lesions that required rotational atherectomy (SES 72.7 % vs. PES 16.7 %; P = 0.0067). However, 1 year after PCI, there was no difference between the two groups in all-cause death, myocardial infarction or major adverse cardiac events. Patients undergoing HD are at a high risk of restenosis after PCI, even when using a drug-eluting stent. The TLR was higher with SES than with PES, particularly when used for severe calcified lesions that required rotational atherectomy.",

All patients were rigorously hydrated from six hours before intervention. In 562 evaluable patients (of 592 recruited), the contrast volume, presence of diabetes mellitus, mean baseline SCr and estimated glomerular filtration rate (eGFR) were comparable between the iopromide- and iodixanol-treated groups. SCr increases of ≥50% occurred in 1\/278 (0.4%) of patients after iopromide and 1\/284 (0.3%) after iodixanol. Incidences in the secondary endpoints were the following: SCr increases of ≥0.5 mg\/dL, 1.4% and 0.7%, respectively; SCr increases of ≥25%, 5.4% and 2.8%; eGFR decreases of ≥25%, 3.6% and 2.5%. Only one patient showed renal failure, one week after dosing with iodixanol. All differences were statistically insignificant, in the overall collective group and in the subgroup with diabetes (n=170).\nCONCLUSIONS: With rigorous hydration, the CIN incidence was very low in patients with moderate renal dysfunction who underwent coronary angiography or PCI. No difference in nephrotoxicity was found between iopromide and iodixanol.",

We analyzed 209 transplanted patients: 97 in the thymoglobulin and 112 in the control group.\nRESULTS: The main complication was DGF (59.3%), with a similar incidence in both groups (63.9% vs. 55.3%; P = .36). Acute rejection episodes (ARE) were decreased with thymoglobulin (8.2% vs. 28.5%; P < .001), but cytomegalovirus viremia was 3.4-fold more frequent (58.3% vs. 17.1%; P < .001).

We evaluated the impact of renal insufficiency on the clinical and angiographic outcomes after treatment for SES restenosis.\nMETHODS AND RESULTS: A total of 74 patients with 76 lesions underwent subsequent revascularization with a drug-eluting stent for SES restenosis. Patients were classified into three groups: group 1 included 29 patients with an estimated glomerular filtration rate more than 60 ml\/min\/1.73 m(2); group 2 included 27 patients with lower estimated glomerular filtration rate (<60 ml\/min\/1.73 m(2)) without hemodialysis (HD) dependence; and group 3 included 18 patients on HD.

Late lumen loss at the 8-month follow-up angiography showed progressive increases from group 1 to 2 to 3 (group 1: 0.36 ± 0.39 mm, group 2: 1.11 ± 0.61 mm, group 3: 1.30 ± 0.85 mm, P<0.001). Similarly, compared with group 1, groups 2 and 3 had significantly higher rates of major adverse cardiac events (6.9, 37.0, and 38.9%, respectively, P=0.001), primarily because of a high frequency of target lesion revascularization (8.0, 34.8, and 33.3%, respectively, P=0.019).\nCONCLUSION: Non-HD-dependent chronic kidney disease patients had increased neointimal growth in the follow-up phase after percutaneous coronary intervention, with a drug-eluting stent for SES restenosis almost equivalent to patients on HD, resulting in higher rates of recurrent restenosis than patients with preserved renal function.",

Recent data from patients undergoing on-pump coronary artery bypass grafting suggest that a perioperative infusion of sodium-bicarbonate may decrease the incidence of CSA-AKI. The present study aims to analyze the renoprotective effects of a 24h infusion of sodium-bicarbonate in a large, heterogeneous group of cardiac surgical patients\nMETHODS: Starting in 4\/2009, all patients undergoing cardiac surgery at our institution were enrolled in a prospective trial analyzing the relationship between preoperative cerebral oxygen saturation and postoperative organ dysfunction. We used this prospectively sampled data set to perform a cohort analysis of the renoprotective efficiency of a 24h continuous perioperative infusion of sodium-bicarbonate on the incidence of CSA-AKI that was routinely introduced in 7\/2009. After exclusion of patients with endstage chronic kidney disease, off-pump procedures, and emergency cases, perioperative changes in renal function were assessed in 280 patients treated with a perioperative infusion of 4 mmol sodium-bicarbonate \/ kg body weight in comparison with a control cohort of 304 patients enrolled from April to June in this prospective cohort study.\nRESULTS: With the exception of a lower prevalence of a history of myocardial infarction and a lower preoperative use of intravenous heparin in the bicarbonate-group, no significant between group differences in patient demographics, surgical risk, type, and duration of surgery were observed. Patients in the bicarbonate group had a lower mean arterial blood pressure after induction of anesthesia, needed more fluids, more vasopressors, and a longer treatment time in the high dependency unit. Despite a higher postoperative diuresis, no differences in the incidence of AKI grade 1 to 3 and the need for renal replacement were observed.\nCONCLUSIONS: Routine perioperative administration of sodium bicarbonate failed to improve postoperative renal function in a large population of cardiac surgical patients.",

The aim of this study was to perform a meta-analysis of randomized controlled trials to compare the effect of PTRA and medical therapy on nonfatal myocardial infarction in patients with ARAS.\nMETHODS: We searched for articles reporting cardiovascular outcome, including nonfatal myocardial infarction, in patients with renal artery stenosis randomized to PTRA with\/without stenting or medical therapy.\nRESULTS: Five studies were identified. The pooled population consisted of 1,159 subjects who experienced 56 nonfatal myocardial infarctions. When compared with medical therapy, the overall relative risk (RR) was 0.85 (95% confidence interval (CI) 0.51-1.42), P = 0.55, for PTRA. There was no significant difference between PTRA and medical therapy according to procedural characteristics (with\/without stent placement), mean serum creatinine at follow-up (higher or lower than 2.0 mg\/dl), and maximum follow-up length (> or <2 years).\nCONCLUSIONS: In patients with ARAS and hypertension, there is a lack of evidence supporting the superiority of PTRA over medical therapy in prevention of nonfatal myocardial infarction.

        "Abstract":"BACKGROUND: Recent European guidelines for the management of atrial fibrillation recommend oral anticoagulation (OAC) in patients with CHA(2)DS(2)-VASc score (congestive heart failure, hypertension, age ≥75 years, diabetes, history of previous stroke, vascular disease, age 65-74 years, and sex category [female]) ≥1. The HAS-BLED score (Hypertension, Abnormal renal\/liver function, Stroke, Bleeding history or predisposition, Labile international normalized ratio, Elderly [>65 years], Drugs\/alcohol concomitantly) has been suggested to assess bleeding risk in patients with atrial fibrillation (score ≥3 indicates high risk of bleeding). Despite the guidelines, this approach has never been tested in a cohort of patients with atrial fibrillation undergoing percutaneous coronary intervention with stent implantation.\nMETHODS AND RESULTS: We studied 590 consecutive patients with atrial fibrillation undergoing percutaneous coronary intervention\/stenting and CHA(2)DS(2)-VASC score >1 (ie, OAC recommended). We compared patients with low-intermediate bleeding risk (HAS-BLED 0-2) and high risk (HAS-BLED ≥3), the relation between CHA(2)DS(2)-VASC and HAS-BLED, and the benefit and risks of the use of OAC in patients with high bleeding risk. The development of any bleeding episode, thromboembolism, mortality, cardiac events, and the composite major adverse cardiac events (ie, death, acute myocardial infarction, and\/or target lesion revascularization) end point was recorded as well as the composite major adverse events (ie, major adverse cardiac events, major bleeding, or thromboembolism) end point at 1-year follow-up. Of the study cohort, 420 (71%) had a HAS-BLED score ≥3, and patients who were on OAC at discharge had lower mortality rate (9.3% versus 20.1%; P<0.01) and major adverse cardiac events (13.0% versus 26.4%; P<0.01) but with a similar major adverse event (20.5% versus 27.6%; P=0.11) and higher major bleeding rate (11.8% versus 4.0%; P<0.01). In a Cox multivariable analysis in patients with HAS-BLED ≥3, predictors of increased death were chronic renal failure and heart failure (both P<0.05), whereas OAC at discharge was associated with a reduced death rate (P<0.01). Predictors of major bleeding were chronic renal failure and the use of drug-eluting stents (both P<0.05).\nCONCLUSIONS: Most patients with atrial fibrillation undergoing percutaneous coronary intervention\/stenting have a high risk for major bleeding (HAS-BLED score ≥3). Even in these patients, OAC improves prognosis in these patients (reduced mortality and major adverse cardiac events) with an increase in major bleeding.",

        "Abstract":"PURPOSE: Renal dysfunction remains a serious complication of coronary artery bypass grafting (CABG) surgery and is associated with increased mortality and morbidity. To date, a number of different strategies, including new pharmacologic agents, off-pump and cardiopulmonary bypass techniques have been used to avoid it, but none of them proves the excellent result.\nMETHODS: Between April 2009 to September 2011, 185 consecutive patients with multivessel coronary artery disease undergoing elective CABG were included the study. Iloprost was given with the onset of rewarming period at a dose of 1.25-2.5 ng\/kg\/min and it was ended together with the ending of CPB in 94 patients and remaining were in the control group. Creatinine clearance (CCr) and GFR were measured at the time of hospitalisation and on day first and fifth postoperatively. Serum potassium level was determined every 6 hours, during the first 24 hours postoperatively, and every 12 hours for the next 72 hours, and glomerular filtration rate was estimated.\nRESULTS: There was no statistically significant difference in preoperative comorbidity. There were no significant differences in postoperative morbidity or mortality between either of the two groups that completed the study. However, urine output during the operation was significantly higher in the study group. An increase in creatine levels was more common in the control group. Development of a new CCr less than 50 ml\/min was also significantly higher in the control group, postoperatively.\nCONCLUSION: Our study demonstrates that prophylactic intravenous iloprost administration after initiation of a rewarming period during CPB in patients undergoing CABG surgery is associated with improved renal function, compared with conventional treatment in well-hydrated patients. It also has a good safety profile and is generally well tolerated.",

Major adverse cardiac events (MACE) at 1 month and 1 year were compared between these 2 groups. On comparison with the dual therapy group, the triple therapy group had a similar incidence of major bleeding events but a significantly lower incidence of in-hospital mortality. The MACE rate at 1 month was significantly higher for the dual therapy group than for the triple therapy group (16.3% vs. 11.1%, P<0.05), and this difference was mainly attributed to death rather than repeat PCI (12.9% vs. 9.1%, P<0.05). The MACE rate at 1 year and the MACE-free survival time, however, did not differ between the groups.\nCONCLUSIONS: In AMI patients with renal dysfunction, triple antiplatelet therapy has a favorable in-hospital and short-term MACE impact, but it does not have an impact on the 1-year MACE-free survival.",

        "Abstract":"UNLABELLED: Ticagrelor, a cyclopentyltriazolopyrimidine (CPTP), is the representative of a new chemical class of P2Y(12) receptor inhibitors that differ from thienopyridines (ticlopidin, clopidogrel, prasugrel) as ticagrelor is not a prodrug requiring active biotransformation by cytochromes in the liver and thus is characterized by a more rapid, more effective and more consistent platelet inhibition than ticlopidin or clopidogrel. An extensive study program for dose finding and safety for AZD6140 (DISPERSE studies) and a large-scaled phase III trial (PLATO) were undertaken on more than 18,000 patients for validation of efficacy and safety. In the PLATO trial, patients presenting with the broad spectrum of ACS, i.e. unstable angina, non-STEMI or STEMI, were randomized to ticagrelor (Brilique, Brilinta) or clopidogrel within 24 hours after onset of symptoms, regardless whether they were allocated to a planned invasive or conservative treatment. Compared to clopidogrel, ticagrelor reduced rates of the primary endpoint consisting of cardiovascular death, non-fatal MI, or stroke, without an excess of the primary safety endpoint that was PLATO-defined major bleedings. Results from the pre-specified confirmatory subgroup of patients undergoing planned invasive treatment was consistent with PLATO main trial. In addition, the primary endpoint, as well as CV death and all cause death were consistently reduced with ticagrelor in numerous exploratory subgroups including STEMI patients, those planned for non-invasive treatment, patients undergoing CABG, patients with renal failure, and those with diabetes mellitus, although patients were pretreated before coronary angiography and patients with clopidogrel pretreatment were not excluded.\nCONCLUSIONS: The pharmacological properties and convincing study results of the PLATO trial have stimulated a paradigm change for dual antiplatelet therapy. The new ESC guidelines on the management of ACS without ST segment elevation recommend the use of clopidogrel only when a new antiplatelet drug, e.g. ticagrelor or prasugrel is not available or contraindicated.",

After an initial 5,062 patients, 2,999 more were included as part of the DAPT (Dual Antiplatelet Therapy) trial (total n = 8,061).\nMETHODS: One-year clinical events, including stent thrombosis (ST), cardiac death\/myocardial infarction (MI), target lesion failure, and target lesion revascularization, were adjudicated according to Academic Research Consortium criteria, with ST and cardiac death\/MI as primary and co-primary endpoints. Demographic, clinical, and procedural variables were assessed by multivariable analysis. A time-dependent covariate assessed the association between DAPT usage and ST.\nRESULTS: Roughly 61% were off-label; 85.6% remained on DAPT without interruption through 1 year. Incidences of definite\/probable ST, cardiac death\/MI, target lesion failure, and target lesion revascularization were 0.80% (95% confidence interval [CI]: 0.61% to 1.03%), 7.1% (95% CI: 6.51% to 7.68%), 8.9% (95% CI: 8.30% to 9.60%), and 4.3% (95% CI: 3.82% to 4.75%), respectively. Several independent clinical and angiographic predictors were identified for each outcome. Predictors of ST included DAPT interruption ≤ 30 days (hazard ratio [HR]: 8.63, 95% CI: 2.69 to 27.73, p = 0.0003), renal insufficiency (HR: 3.72, 95% CI: 1.71 to 8.09, p = 0.0009), and total stent length (HR: 1.30, 95% CI: 1.16 to 1.47, p < 0.0001). A DAPT interruption >30 days was not predictive of ST.\nCONCLUSIONS: In this large, real-world population, XIENCE V demonstrated low event rates at 1 year, with several independent predictors. Early DAPT interruption (≤ 30 days) was the most potent predictor of ST, whereas delayed interruption (>30 days) was not predictive.

No quantitative coronary angiography (QCA) analysis has been reported.\nMETHODS AND RESULTS: The OUtcome of Cypher stent in Hemodialysis patients (OUCH) Study is a prospective non-randomized single-arm registry designed to assess the results of sirolimus-eluting stents in HD patients, with follow-up QCA in an independent core laboratory. The primary endpoint was the occurrence of target-vessel failure (TVF) defined as cardiac death, myocardial infarction (MI), and target-vessel revascularization (TVR) at 1 year. A total of 117 patients were enrolled. The TVF rate was 24.9% (2.6% cardiac death, 1.4% MI, 23.9% TVR), and stent thrombosis was documented in 1 patient (0.9%). Coronary calcification was a predictor of TVF. Late lumen loss (LLL) averaged 0.69±0.93mm. The histogram of LLL showed that a total of 76% of lesions were distributed the same normally as that in normal renal function (average LLL 0.20±0.29mm), but 24% of lesions were outliers (average LLL 2.07±0.62mm).\nCONCLUSIONS: This report describes different clinical and QCA results in HD patients as higher TVF rate, different predictive factors, and different histogram of LLL compared with normal renal function. The different histogram of LLL was the existence of many outliers with the same average and the same deviation, suggesting the loss of sirolimus had an effect on a significant number of HD patients.",

        "Abstract":"Bivalirudin, a direct thrombin inhibitor, is as effective as unfractionated heparin (UFH), with decreased bleeding in patients with acute coronary syndromes who undergo percutaneous coronary intervention (PCI). The aim of this study was to evaluate the effectiveness of bivalirudin versus UFH in selected PCI patients at high bleeding risk. Four hundred one consecutive patients who underwent PCI fulfilling ≥ 1 enrollment criterion (age >75 years, chronic renal failure, and diabetes mellitus) were randomized to bivalirudin (bolus 0.75 mg\/kg followed by infusion during the procedure; n = 198) or UFH (75 IU\/kg; n = 203). In the overall population, 39% were aged >75 years, 22% had renal failure, 63% had diabetes, and 29% had acute coronary syndromes. The primary efficacy end point was the 30-day incidence of major adverse cardiac events (cardiac death, myocardial infarction, stent thrombosis, or target vessel revascularization). The primary safety end point was the occurrence of any bleeding or entry-site complications after PCI. All patients were preloaded with clopidogrel 600 mg. Glycoprotein IIb\/IIIa inhibitors were used at the operators' discretion. Thirty-day major adverse cardiac event rates were 11.1% in the bivalirudin group and 8.9% in the UFH group (p = 0.56); the primary efficacy end point was reached mainly because of periprocedural myocardial infarction; 1 patient in the bivalirudin group had stent thrombosis. Occurrence of the primary safety end point was 1.5% in the bivalirudin group and 9.9% in the UFH group (p = 0.0001); this benefit was essentially driven by the prevention of entry-site hematomas >10 cm (0.5% vs 6.9%, p = 0.002). In conclusion, Anti-Thrombotic Strategy for Reduction of Myocardial Damage During Angioplasty-Bivalirudin vs Heparin (ARMYDA-7 BIVALVE) indicates that bivalirudin, compared with UFH, causes significantly lower bleeding and has a similar incidence of major adverse cardiac events in patients with older age, diabetes mellitus, or chronic renal failure who undergo PCI.",

        "Abstract":"OBJECTIVE: The optimal treatment of multivessel coronary artery disease is not well established. Hybrid coronary revascularization by combining the left internal mammary artery-left anterior descending artery graft and drug-eluting stents in non-left anterior descending artery territories might offer superior results compared with sole coronary artery bypass grafting or sole percutaneous coronary intervention.\nMETHODS: We retrospectively analyzed the 30-day outcomes of 381 consecutive patients undergoing coronary artery bypass grafting (n = 301) vs hybrid coronary revascularization (n = 80). In a 2 × 2 matrix, the 2 groups were stratified by the Synergy Between Percutaneous Coronary Intervention With Taxus and Cardiac Surgery (SYNTAX) score (≤32 vs ≥33) and the European System for Cardiac Operative Risk Evaluation (euroSCORE) (<5 vs ≥5). The composite endpoint (death from any cause, stroke, myocardial infarction, low cardiac output syndrome) and secondary endpoints (worsening postprocedural renal function and bleeding) were determined.\nRESULTS: After stratification using the SYNTAX and the euroSCORE, the preoperative characteristics were similar within the 4 groups, except for the ≥33 SYNTAX\/>5 euroSCORE. The hybrid coronary revascularization patients were older (77 vs 65 years, P = .001). The postoperative outcomes using combined SYNTAX and the euroSCORE stratification showed a similar rate of the composite endpoint for all groups except for patients with ≥33 SYNTAX\/>5 euroSCORE (0% for the coronary artery bypass grafting group vs 33% for the hybrid coronary revascularization group, P = .001). An analysis of the secondary endpoint showed similar results across all groups, except for in the ≥33 SYNTAX\/>5 euroSCORE group, in which bleeding (re-exploration for bleeding and transfusion >3 packed red blood cell units per patient) was 44% in the hybrid coronary revascularization group vs 11% in the coronary artery bypass grafting group (P = .05).\nCONCLUSIONS: Hybrid coronary revascularization is a safe alternative to coronary artery bypass grafting in many patients with multivessel coronary artery disease. However, in high-risk patients with complex coronary artery disease (≥33 SYNTAX\/>5 euroSCORE), coronary artery bypass grafting is superior to hybrid coronary revascularization.",

However, the efficacy of DES for dialysis patients still remains controversial. This study compares the early and long-term clinical outcomes of coronary artery bypass grafting (CABG) and PCI with DES in dialysis patients.\nMETHODS: A retrospective review was performed in 125 dialysis patients treated between 2004 and 2007. Fifty-eight patients underwent CABG and 67 underwent PCI with DES. The overall death, cardiac death, and cardiac-related event rates were analyzed using the Kaplan-Meier method. For the risk-adjusted comparisons, multivariable logistic and Cox regression analyses were used.\nRESULTS: The preoperative characteristics of the patients were similar except for the ejection fraction (p = 0.002) and the number of diseased vessels (p < 0.001). The 30-day mortality was 0 in both groups. The overall survival rates at one, three, and five years were 84.2%, 64.7%, and 56.2% in CABG group and 88.2%, 75.5%, and 61.7% in DES group, respectively (p = 0.202).

        "Abstract":"Contrast-induced nephropathy (CIN) is characterized by acute deterioration of renal function that occurs after parenteral administration of contrast media in the absence of other causes. Although no definite proof has been obtained yet, the risk of diuretics or angiotensin-converting enzyme inhibitors (ACEI) to exacerbate CIN has been reported because of their effects on renal perfusion. This study was conducted to assess the protective effect of hydration alone in the prevention of CIN after percutaneous coronary intervention (PCI) in patients on diuretics or ACEI. This randomized clinical trial was conducted at the Chamran Hospital, Isfahan University of Medical Sciences, Iran, during the years 2006-2007. The study patients were divided into four groups, each group containing 60 patients. Patients in groups A and B were on regular treatment with ACEI (captopril) and patients in groups C and D were on regular diuretic (furosemide) therapy. About 36 h before PCI, captopril in group A and furosemide in group C were discontinued. The serum creatinine (Cr) levels were measured at the time of performing PCI and 24 h and 48 h after PCI in all patients. All patients received 1 mL\/kg\/h normal saline (0.9%) 12 h before and 24 h after PCI. The occurrence of CIN after PCI was diagnosed based on the following formula: Cr level after PCI - Cr level before PCI. If this value was greater than 0.5 mg\/dL, it was coded as one and if the value was less than 0.5 mg\/dL, it was coded as zero. The mean difference was analyzed and compared among the four groups by the ANOVA test. Three patients (5%) in group A, two patients (3.3%) in group B, two patients (3.3%) in group C and one patient (1.6%) in group D had a >0.5 mg\/dL difference in serum Cr. The difference seen between these groups was not statistically significant (P > 0.05). This study shows that although furosemide and captopril can exacerbate CIN by impairment of renal perfusion, this can be prevented by hydration and discontinuation of furosemide and captopril may not be required.",

To prevent CIN, we examined using a local application of N-acetylcysteine (NAC) for the prevention of CIN during primary angioplasty. We hypothesized that a local application of NAC into the renal arteries would provide the benefit of a higher local concentration, lower first-pass metabolism, and faster efficacy. To evaluate the effects of NAC by the intrarenal route, we performed a prospective, randomized clinical study in patients with acute myocardial infarction treated with primary angioplasty.\nMETHODS: Participants were 312 patients with ST-segment elevation myocardial infarction undergoing primary angiography. Eligible patients were randomly assigned to receive intravenous NAC, intrarenal NAC, or placebo.\nRESULTS: Overall, CIN occurred in 74 (23.7%) of the 312 patients. The rate of CIN was 25% in the intravenous NAC group, 22.9% in the intrarenal NAC group, and 23.2% in the placebo group, with no significant effect seen for either treatment (P=0.64). We did find a significant correlation between CIN and ejection fraction (P=0.05) and baseline renal function (P=0.01).\nCONCLUSION: Both intrarenal and intravenous applications of NAC failed to show any benefit over placebo in the prevention of CIN. This result shows that NAC application does not have any prophylactic effect, dose dependent or otherwise, on CIN, as previously reported. Our results suggest that more attention should be paid to optimize hemodynamic variables for the prevention of CIN.",

This study was aimed to examine the effect of preoperative aspirin use on patients undergoing cardiac surgery.\nMETHODS: An observational cohort study was performed on consecutive patients (n = 1879) receiving cardiac surgery at this institution. The patients excluded from the study were those with preoperative anticoagulants, unknown aspirin use, or underwent emergent cardiac surgery. Outcome events included were 30-day mortality, renal failure, readmission and a composite outcome--major adverse cardiocerebral events (MACE) that include permanent or transient stroke, coma, perioperative myocardial infarction (MI), heart block and cardiac arrest.\nRESULTS: Of all patients, 1145 patients met the inclusion criteria and were divided into two groups: those taking (n = 858) or not taking (n = 287) aspirin within 5 days preceding surgery. Patients with aspirin presented significantly more with history of hypertension, diabetes, peripheral arterial disease, previous MI, angina and older age. With propensity scores adjusted and multivariate logistic regression, however, this study showed that preoperative aspirin therapy (vs. no aspirin) significantly reduced the risk of MACE (8.4% vs. 12.5%, odds ratio [OR] 0.585, 95% CI 0.355-0.964, P = 0.035), postoperative renal failure (2.6% vs. 5.2%, OR 0.438, CI 0.203-0.945, P = 0.035) and dialysis required (0.8% vs. 3.1%, OR 0.230, CI 0.071-0.742, P = 0.014), but did not significantly reduce 30-day mortality (4.1% vs. 5.8%, OR 0.744, CI 0.376-1.472, P = 0.396) nor it increased readmissions in the patients undergoing cardiac surgery.\nCONCLUSIONS: Preoperative aspirin therapy is associated with a significant decrease in the risk of MACE and renal failure and did not increase readmissions in patients undergoing non-emergent cardiac surgery.",

Of these, 327 were treated with re-DES (58.1%), 132 underwent vascular brachytherapy (23.4%), and 104 were treated with conventional balloon angioplasty (18.5%). Variables associated with target lesion revascularization at 1 year were explored by individual proportional hazard models. This population presents a high prevalence of comorbidities, including diabetes (43.7%), previous myocardial infarction (MI) (45.8%), coronary bypass graft surgery (39.2%), chronic renal failure (18.8%), and heart failure (17.3%). Baseline clinical characteristics were balanced among the 3 groups; however, patients undergoing vascular brachytherapy presented with more complex lesions and a higher prevalence of prior stent\/vascular brachytherapy failure than did the rest of the population. The overall incidence of recurrent DES failure at 1-year follow-up was 12.2%, which was similar among the 3 groups (P=0.41). The rate of the composite end point (death, Q-wave-MI and target lesion revascularization) at 1-year follow-up was 14.1% for re-DES, 17.5% for vascular brachytherapy, and 18.0% for conventional balloon angioplasty (P=0.57). After univariable analysis tested the traditional known covariates related to ISR, none of them were associated with repeat target lesion revascularization.\nCONCLUSIONS: Recurrence of ISR after DES treatment failure is neither infrequent nor benign, and optimal therapy remains unclear and challenging. Given the absence of traditional risk factors for ISR in this population, further research is required to elucidate both the correlates involved in DES ISR and the optimal treatment for this condition.",

        "Abstract":"BACKGROUND: Probucol, a lipid-lowering drug with potent antioxidant properties, may reduce the risk of cystatin C (CyC)-based contrast-induced acute kidney injury (CIAKI). The aim of this study was to observe the incidence of CyC-based CIAKI and assess the efficacy of probucol on prevention of CIAKI following primary or urgent coronary angioplasty.\nMETHODS: A total of 204 patients with acute coronary syndrome (ACS) were prospectively randomized to a control group (108 patients, 74 male, 65.4 ± 12.5 years) or probucol group (96 patients, 67 male, 65.1 ± 10.5 years) 1000 mg orally before primary or urgent angioplasty and 500 mg twice daily for 3 days following intervention. Serum CyC and serum creatinine (Scr) concentrations were measured before, and on day 1, day 2 and day 3 after coronary intervention.\nRESULTS: The clinical characteristics of the patients from the two groups were similar. Scr-based CIAKI was developed in 23 patients of the control group (21.3%) and in 4 patients of the probucol group (4.2%) (P<0.001). Furthermore, CyC-based CIAKI occurred in 56 patients of the control group (51.9%) and 28 patients of the probucol group (29.2%) (P<0.001). The CyC increase ≥ 10% after exposure to contrast medium was the best increment cutoff value for the early identification of patients at risk of CIAKI.\nCONCLUSIONS: Our study suggests that CyC is a reliable marker for early identification and ruling out the patients at the risk of CIAKI. Among the patients with ACS who are undergoing primary or urgent angioplasty, prophylactic treatment with probucol reduces the risk of both Scr and CyC-based CIAKI.",

Patient and clinical characteristics were essentially similar in both groups. ACS was a positive adjusted predictor of BMS\/DES concurrent stenting (OR 1.52; 95% CI 1.23-1.87) as was age (OR 1.14; 1.04-1.25). Negative predictors were in-stent stenosis (OR 0.49; 0.35-0.68), lesion length >20 mm (OR 0.62; 0.51-0.75), >85% stenosis prior to PCI (OR 0.68; 0.56-0.83) and cardiogenic shock (OR 0.29; 0.09-0.93). The in-hospital mortality in patients receiving BMS\/DES concurrent stenting was higher than in those receiving DES\/DES placement (OR 2.61; 95% CI 1.05-6.49). At the 12 months follow-up there were no statistical differences with respect to mortality (OR 0.94; 95% CI 0.55-1.61). However, the incidence of recurrent myocardial infarction (OR 1.86; 1.11-3.12) and target vessel revascularization (TVR) (OR 1.37; 1.06-1.76) was borderline to significantly higher in BMS\/DES patients. Multivariable predictors of 1-year mortality were age, ACS, cardiogenic shock, renal insufficiency, PAD, heart failure and smoking.\nCONCLUSIONS: Concurrent BMS\/DES stenting is associated with an increase in in-hospital but not long-term mortality. Further, there was a significant increase in recurrent myocardial infarction and TVR, but absolute differences were low.",

        "Abstract":"Renal dysfunction is a strong independent predictor of stent thrombosis. The aim of the present study was to evaluate the strength and direction of the association between kidney function and clopidogrel efficacy. The study group consisted of consecutive patients (n = 275) who underwent stent implantation. Drug efficacy was measured using the vasodilator-stimulated phosphoprotein (VASP) index 20 ± 4 hours after clopidogrel 600 mg. Nonresponse was defined as an VASP index ≥50%. Renal function was determined using serum cystatin C. The upper reference levels are 1.12 mg\/L for ≤65 years of age and 1.21 mg\/L for >65 years of age. Estimated glomerular filtration was calculated using cystatin C. The median value of cystatin C was 1.16 mg\/L (twenty-fifth and seventy-fifth percentiles 0.96 and 1.43); 47.63% of the study population had cystatin C above reference levels and 33.1% of patients were nonresponders to clopidogrel. No correlation was found between clopidogrel efficacy assessed with the VASP index and kidney function assessed with cystatin C (Spearman r = -0.070, p = 0.248). Based on cystatin C the proportion of nonresponders to clopidogrel was 34.4% versus 31.9% (p = 0.702) in patients with impaired renal function compared to normal renal function, respectively. The proportion of clopidogrel nonresponders did not differ (p = 0.902) among groups with normal (28.8%), mildly impaired (34.8%), moderately impaired (32.9%), and severely impaired (34.8%) renal function. In conclusion, renal function assessed by cystatin C does not predict clopidogrel efficacy. Renal dysfunction is a complex entity and its significant relation to stent thrombosis cannot be explained simply by a decrease in clopidogrel efficacy.",

CRF was defined as CrCl less than 60 mL\/minute. Cardiovascular death, major adverse cardiac events (MACE, defined as cardiovascular death, myocardial infarction, stroke and target lesion revascularization [TLR]), TLR and definite stent thrombosis (ST) were recorded at 1 year.\nRESULTS: We note that 1376 consecutive patients underwent PCI with stent within 18 months: 534 (39%) and 492 (36%) patients without CRF and 224 (16%) and 126 (9%) patients with CRF were treated with BMS and DES, respectively. In the entire cohort, patients treated with DES had a higher restenosis risk profile. BMS were predominantly (87%) used for ST-segment elevation myocardial infarction. At 1 year, 6.2% had cardiovascular death, 15.8% MACE, 7.3% TLR and 1.5% ST. Cardiovascular death and MACE occurred less frequently in DES groups. The TLR rate was not significantly different in the CRF groups (BMS 9.8% vs DES 7.1%; P=0.44). No excess of ST was observed in the DES groups and use of DES was independently associated with absence of MACE and TLR.\nCONCLUSIONS: In patients with CRF, DES appear to be at least as effective as BMS--despite a higher restenosis risk profile--with no excess of ST at 1 year.",

This group is not well studied in international trials and is probably treated with a more conservative approach.\nOBJECTIVES: To evaluate the presentation and treatment of myocardial infarction according to age, particularly in very elderly patients.\nMETHODS: We studied 1242 consecutive patients admitted with acute myocardial infarction, assessing in-hospital, 30-day and one-year mortality during follow-up for each age-group. Patients were divided into four groups according to age: <45 years (7.6%); 45-64 years (43.3%); 65-74 years (23.4%); and ≥75 years (25.7%).\nRESULTS: Elderly patients had a worse risk profile (except for smoking), more previous history of coronary disease and a worse profile on admission, with the exception of lipid profile, which was more favorable. With regard to treatment of the elderly, although less optimized than in other age-groups, it was significantly better compared to other registries, including for percutaneous coronary angioplasty. Both complications and mortality were worse in the older groups. In elderly patients (≥75 years), adjusted risk of mortality was 4.9-6.3 times higher (p<0.001) than patients in the reference age-group (45-64 years). In these patients, the independent predictors of death were left ventricular function and renal function, use of beta-blockers being a predictor of survival.\nCONCLUSIONS: Elderly patients represent a substantial proportion of the population admitted with myocardial infarction, and receive less evidenced-based therapy.

The aim of the current analysis was to determine the rate, clinical impact, and predictors of major and fatal bleeding complications in the PLATO study. METHODS AND RESULTS PLATO was a randomized, double-blind, active control international, phase 3 clinical trial in patients with acute ST elevation and non-ST-segment elevation ACS. A total of 18 624 patients were randomized to either ticagrelor, a non-thienopyridine, reversibly binding platelet P2Y(12) receptor antagonist, or clopidogrel in addition to aspirin. Patients randomized to ticagrelor and clopidogrel had similar rates of PLATO major bleeding (11.6 vs. 11.2%; P = 0.43), TIMI major bleeding (7.9 vs. 7.7%, P = 0.56) and GUSTO severe bleeding (2.9 vs. 3.1%, P = 0.22). Procedure-related bleeding rates were also similar. Non-CABG major bleeding (4.5 vs. 3.8%, P = 0.02) and non-procedure-related major bleeding (3.1 vs. 2.3%, P = 0.05) were more common in ticagrelor-treated patients, primarily after 30 days on treatment. Fatal bleeding and transfusion rates did not differ between groups. There were no significant interactions for major bleeding or combined minor plus major bleeding between treatment groups and age ≥75 years, weight <60 kg, region, chronic kidney disease, creatinine clearance <60 mL\/min, aspirin dose >325 mg on the day of randomization, pre-randomization clopidogrel administration, or clopidogrel loading dose. CONCLUSION Ticagrelor compared with clopidogrel was associated with similar total major bleeding but increased non-CABG and non-procedure-related major bleeding, primarily after 30 days on study drug treatment.

Postoperative blood and urine samples showed inflammatory changes more often in group 1, free of infection bacterial tests were more often in group 2. Renal microcirculation in group 1 after TUR evidenced for functional depression on perfusion intensity and renal ischemia and congestion. These changes persisted on postoperative day 8, being a potential cause of renal inflammation and ascending pyelonephritis. Group 2 patients exhibited insignificant postoperative microcirculatory disorders in the kidneys and were not registered on postoperative day 8.

The clinical outcome in this population was compared retrospectively based on the presence of DM. Major adverse cardiac events (MACE) as the composite of all-cause death, Q-wave myocardial infarction and target lesion revascularization (TLR), as well as TLR as an individual outcome, were the main end points of the study.\nRESULTS: In the study cohort (n = 198), 48.5% had DM.

However, the efficacy of this preventive strategy has not yet been established for patients with ST-elevation-myocardial infarction (STEMI), who are at higher risk of this complication after primary percutaneous coronary intervention (PCI). In this randomized study we investigated the possible beneficial role of periprocedural intravenous volume expansion and we compared the efficacy of 2 different hydration strategies in patients with STEMI undergoing primary PCI.\nMETHODS AND RESULTS: We randomly assigned 450 STEMI patients to receive (1) preprocedure and postprocedure hydration of sodium bicarbonate (early hydration group), (2) postprocedure hydration of isotonic saline (late hydration group), or (3) no hydration (control group). The primary end point was the development of CI-AKI, defined as an increase in serum creatinine of ≥25% or 0.5 mg\/dL over the baseline value within 3 days after administration of the contrast medium. Moreover, we evaluated a possible relationship between the occurrence of CI-AKI and total hydration volume administered. There were no significant differences in baseline clinical, biochemical, and procedural characteristics in the 3 groups. Overall, CI-AKI occurred in 93 patients (20.6%): the incidence was significantly lower in the early hydration group (12%) with respect to both the late hydration group (22.7%) and the control group (27.3%) (P for trend=0.001). In hydrated patients (early and late hydration groups), lower infused volumes were associated with a significant increase in CI-AKI incidence, and the optimal cutoff point of hydration volume that best discriminates patients at higher risk was ≤960 mL.\nCONCLUSIONS: Adequate intravenous volume expansion may prevent CI-AKI in patients undergoing primary PCI. A regimen of preprocedure and postprocedure hydration therapy with sodium bicarbonate appears to be more efficacious than postprocedure hydration only with isotonic saline.",

Net adverse cardiac event (NACE) was defined as the composite of death, reinfarction, ischemia-driven target vessel revascularization (TVR), stroke or non-coronary artery bypass grafting (CABG)-related major bleeding.\nRESULTS: Patients with CKD compared with patients without had higher rates of NACE (41.4% vs. 23.8%, p < 0.0001), death (18.7% vs. 4.4%, p < 0.0001), and major bleeding (19.3% vs. 6.7%, p < 0.0001). Multivariable analysis identified baseline creatinine as an independent predictor of death at 3 years (hazard ratio: 1.51, 95% confidence interval: 1.21 to 1.87, p < 0.001). Patients with CKD randomized to bivalirudin monotherapy versus heparin plus GPI had no significant difference in major bleeding (19.0% vs. 19.6%, p = 0.72) or death (19.0% vs. 18.4%, p = 0.88) at 3 years. In patients with CKD, there was no difference in the rates of TVR in bare-metal stents (BMS) versus drug-eluting stents (DES) at 3 years (14.1% vs. 15.1%, p = 0.8).\nCONCLUSIONS: STEMI patients with CKD have significantly higher rates of death and major bleeding compared with those without CKD. In patients with CKD, there appears to be no benefit of bivalirudin compared with heparin + GPI, or DES versus BMS during primary PCI in improving clinical outcomes.",

        "Abstract":"BACKGROUND: The pulmonary artery catheter (PAC) continues to be used for monitoring of hemodynamics in patients undergoing coronary artery bypass graft (CABG) surgery despite concerns raised in other settings regarding both effectiveness and safety. Given the relative paucity of data regarding its use in CABG patients, and given entrenched practice patterns, we assessed the impact of PAC use on fatal and nonfatal CABG outcomes as practiced at a diverse set of medical centers.\nMETHODS: Using a formal prospective observational study design, 5065 CABG patients from 70 centers were enrolled between November 1996 and June 2000 using a systemic sampling protocol. Propensity score matched-pair analysis was used to adjust for differences in likelihood of PAC insertion. The predefined composite endpoint was the occurrence of any of the following: death (any cause), cardiac dysfunction (myocardial infarction or congestive heart failure), cerebral dysfunction (stroke or encephalopathy), renal dysfunction (dysfunction or failure), or pulmonary dysfunction (acute respiratory distress syndrome). Secondary variables included treatment indices (inotrope use, fluid administration), duration of postoperative intubation, and intensive care unit length of stay. After categorization based on PAC and transesophageal echocardiography use (both, neither, PAC only, transesophageal echocardiography only), we performed the primary analysis contrasting PAC only and neither (total, 3321 patients), from which propensity paring yielded 1273 matched pairs.\nRESULTS: The primary endpoint occurred in 271 PAC patients versus 196 without PAC (21.3% vs.15.4%; adjusted odds ratio [AOR], 1.68; 95% confidence interval [CI], 1.24 to 2.26; P<0.001). The PAC group had an increased risk of all-cause mortality, 3.5% vs 1.7% (AOR, 2.08; 95% CI, 1.11 to 3.88; P=0.02) and an increased risk of cardiac (AOR, 1.58; 95% CI, 1.14 to 2.20; P=0.007), cerebral (AOR, 2.02; 95% CI, 1.08 to 3.77; P=0.03) and renal (AOR, 2.47; 95% CI, 1.68 to 3.62; P<0.001) morbid outcomes. PAC patients received inotropic drugs more frequently (57.8% vs 50.0%; P<0.001), had a larger positive IV fluid balance after surgery (3220 mL vs 3022 mL; P=0.003), and experienced longer time to tracheal extubation (15.40 hours [11.28\/20.80] versus 13.18 hours [9.58\/19.33], median plus Q1\/Q3 interquartile range; P<0.0001). Use of PAC was also associated with prolonged intensive care unit stay (14.5% vs 10.1%; AOR, 1.55; 95% CI, 1.06 to 2.27; P=0.02).\nCONCLUSIONS: Use of a PAC during CABG surgery was associated with increased mortality and a higher risk of severe end-organ complications in this propensity-matched observational study. A randomized controlled trial with defined hemodynamic goals would be ideal to either confirm or refute our findings.",

Although small randomized, controlled clinical trials showed a reduced target vessel revascularization rate and a good safety profile for sirolimus-eluting coronary stents (SES), safety data need to be confirmed in clinical practice. Therefore, the data of the German DES.DE registry were evaluated to obtain acute and long-term data of this high-risk subgroup.\nMETHODS: The prospective multicenter German DES.DE registry enables to monitor the therapeutic outcome of different drug-eluting stents in the context of the German Health Care System.

        "Abstract":"Patients with chronic kidney disease (CKD) have a disproportionate burden of coronary artery disease and commonly undergo revascularization. The role and safety of percutaneous coronary intervention (PCI) using drug-eluting stents (DESs) verses bare-metal stents in patients with CKD not on renal replacement therapy has not been fully evaluated. This study investigated the efficacy and safety of DES in patients with CKD not on renal replacement therapy. Patients were drawn from the National Heart, Lung, and Blood Institute Dynamic Registry and were stratified by renal function based on estimated glomerular filtration rate (GFR). Of the 4,157 participants, 1,108 had CKD (\"low GFR\" <60 ml\/min\/1.73 m(2)), whereas 3,049 patients had normal renal function (\"normal GFR\" ≥60 ml\/min\/1.73 m(2)). For each stratum of renal function we compared risk of death, myocardial infarction, or repeat revascularization between subjects who received DESs and bare-metal stents at the index procedure. Patients with low GFR had higher 1-year rates of death and myocardial infarction and a decreased rate of repeat revascularization compared to patients with normal GFR. Use of DESs was associated with a decreased need for repeat revascularization in the normal-GFR group (adjusted hazard ratio 0.63, 95% confidence interval 0.50 to 0.79, p <0.001) but not in the low-GFR group (hazard ratio 0.69, 95% confidence interval 0.45 to 1.06, p = 0.09). Risks of death and myocardial infarction were not different between the 2 stents in either patient population. In conclusion, presence of CKD predicted poor outcomes after PCI with high rates of mortality regardless of stent type. The effect of DES in decreasing repeat revascularization appeared to be attenuated in these patients.",

The primary endpoints were: 1) the post-operative dialysis-free rate; and 2) serum creatinine (sCr) and estimated glomerular filtration rate. The secondary endpoints were: 1) the early post-operative outcome; 2) outcome at 1 year post-operatively; 3) the maximum sCr, the rate of increase of sCr, and an increase of sCr by ≥ 0.3 mg\/dl compared with the pre-operative value; and 4) ANP and cyclic-guanosine monophosphate levels.\nRESULTS: The post-operative sCr was significantly lower in the hANP group not only in the post-operative acute stage but also in the first year. The maximum Cr and Cr increase rate were significantly lower in the hANP group (p = 0.00665, p < 0.0001).

High-risk patients with NSTEMI are believed to fare better with an EI strategy, but the optimal treatment for patients with NSTEMI and CKD is not known. In total 5,185 patients with acute NSTEMI were enrolled from the Korea Acute Myocardial Infarction Registry and followed for 1 year. Patients were divided into EI, DI, and conservative treatment groups and classified into 4 stages using references from the National Kidney Foundation. The invasive EI and DI groups were compared to the conservative groups, and the EI and DI groups were compared according to each renal function stage. At 1-year follow-up, mortality rates in the conservative group were significantly higher than in the invasive groups except for the severe CKD group. The benefit of the EI over the DI strategy, although there were no significant differences between the 2 groups, tended to decrease as renal function decreased. In conclusion, in the management of NSTEMI, an invasive strategy decreased mortality compared to a conservative strategy except for severe CKD. In the timing of an invasive strategy, the EI strategy was observed to be superior to the DI strategy in patients with mild CKD; however, this tendency reversed as renal function decreased. When patients with NSTEMI have severe CKD, a conservative or DI strategy with prescription of cardioprotective medications and prevention of further deterioration in renal function should be considered.",

It is even more essential now, because the deceased-donor kidney has become fewer after enacting the Chinese Regulation on Human Organ Transplantation. Therefore, there is a continued need to use the limited live-donor population. We chose 103 consecutive cases (84 left and 19 right) that underwent retroperitoneoscopic live-donor nephrectomy between December 2005 and December 2009, to compare the intraoperative and postoperative characteristics between the left and right sides, and report our experiences for 19 right-retroperitoneoscopic live-donor nephrectomies.\nRESULTS: All 84 left and 19 right-retro peritoneoscopic live-donor nephrectomies were accomplished successfully without open conversion and transfusion. No significant differences were observed between the 2 groups regarding operative time, warm ischemia time, estimated blood loss, length of hospital stay, and serum creatinine level at discharge (Table 1). Eight of the donors and 3 of the grafts had minor complications that were all resolved with conservative treatment. The recipient's serum creatinine levels at 1 day and 1 month after surgery were the same in both groups. No acute renal tubule necrosis or delayed graft function was observed in the recipients.\nCONCLUSIONS: Our right-retroperitoneoscopic live-donor nephrectomy achieves comparable outcomes with the left side and proves to be a feasible, cost-effective, safe, and minimally invasive alternative for live-kidney donation. This maximally uses the innately limited donors and potentially increases the donor pool in China.",

        "Abstract":"OBJECTIVE: We compared use of intravenous (IV) normal saline (NS) to sodium bicarbonate (NaHCO(3)) with or without oral N-acetylcysteine (NAC) for prevention of contrast-induced acute kidney injury (CI-AKI).\nBACKGROUND: CI-AKI is associated with significant adverse clinical events. Use of NAC has produced variable results. Recently, intravenous hydration with NaHCO(3) for CI-AKI prophylaxis has been adopted as standard treatment for patients with stable chronic renal disease undergoing catheterization procedures.\nMETHODS: We prospectively enrolled 320 patients with baseline renal insufficiency scheduled to undergo catheterization. Patients were randomly assigned to receive either IV NS ± NAC (n = 161) or IV dextrose 5% in water containing 154 mEq\/l of NaHCO(3) ± NAC (n = 159). IV NS was administered at 1 ml\/kg body weight for 12 hr preprocedure and 12 more hr postprocedure. IV NaHCO(3) was administered at 3 ml\/kg body weight for 1 hr preprocedure followed by 1 ml\/kg body weight postprocedure. A 1,200 mg oral dose of NAC was given 2-12 hr preprocedure and 6-12 hr postprocedure in 50% of patients in each study arm. CI-AKI was defined as an increase of >0.5 mg\/dl or >25% above baseline creatinine.\nRESULTS: Overall incidence of CI-AKI was 10.3%. There was no significant difference in incidence among the two groups (NS ± NAC 11.8% vs. NaHCO(3) ± NAC 8.8%, p = ns). Incidence of CI-AKI increased with increasing age (p = 0.001), contrast agent use >3 ml\/kg body weight (p = 0.038) and diuretic use (p = 0.005).\nCONCLUSION: Incidence of CI-AKI was no different in the NaHCO(3) group compared to NS group, and NAC did not reduce CI-AKI in the two study arms.",

        "Abstract":"Contrast induced nephropathy (CIN), an acute decline in renal function after the administration of intravenous contrast in the absence of other causes, is the third leading cause of acute renal failure in hospitalized patients. Antioxidant N-acetylcysteine prevents acute contrast nephrotoxicity in patients with impaired renal function who underwent coronary angiography (CAG) and percutaneous coronary intervention (PCI). Hydration is the cornerstone in preventing CIN. N-acetylcysteine has additive preventive affect. We compared N-acetylcysteine plus hydration with hydration alone in preventing CIN. Patients were assigned to receive either premedication with hydration with normal saline (1ml\/kg\/hour-12 hour before and 12 hour after CAG and intravenous PCI) alone or to receive both hydration and oral N acetylcysteine (600mg bid for 2 days, starting day before CAG and PCI). Main out come was occurrence of ≥25% or ≥0.5mg\/dl increase in serum creatinine level within 24 to 48 hours after contrast administration; change in creatinine clearance and serum creatinine level. Six patients (12%) of hydration group i.e. Group A and none of the patients of N-acetylcysteine All group i.e. Group B develop CIN (p=0.012). Baseline serum creatinine level was slightly higher in N-acetylcysteine group than hydration group (1.52±0.32 and 1.44±0.22). After 24 hours of CAG and PCI serum creatinine level lower than base line in N-acetylcysteine group but slightly higher than base line in hydration group (1.42±0.39 and 1.51±0.38). Difference in serum creatinine in both the groups were statistically significant (p=0.006 in N-acetylcysteine group and p=0.029 in hydration group). Creatinine clearance rate significantly improved in N-acetylcysteine group after coronary intervention. In conclusion, N-acetylcysteine and hydration prevent CIN better than hydration alone in high risk patients.",

        "Abstract":"BACKGROUND: Immunosuppression for immunologically high-risk kidney transplant patients usually involves antithymocyte globulin induction with triple drug maintenance therapy. Alemtuzumab, a humanized anti-CD52 antibody, was expected to be a promising induction therapy agent for kidney transplantation. However, currently no consensus is available about its efficacy and safety. This study aimed to evaluate the efficacy and safety of alemtuzumab as immune induction therapy in highly sensitized kidney transplant recipients.\nMETHODS: In this prospective, open-label, randomized, controlled trial, we enrolled 23 highly immunological risk patients (panel reactive antibody > 20%). They were divided into two groups: alemtuzumab group (trial group) and anti-thymocyte globulin (ATG) group (control group). Patients in the alemtuzumab group received intravenous alemtuzumab (15 mg) as a single dose before reperfusion. At the 24th hour post-operation, another dosage of alemtuzumab (15 mg) was given. The control group received a bolus of rabbit ATG (9 mg\/kg), which was given 2 hours before kidney transplantation and lasted until the removal of vascular clamps when the anastomoses were completed. Maintenance immunosuppression in both groups comprised standard triple therapy consisting of tacrolimus, prednisone, and mycophenolate mofetil (MMF). Acute rejection (AR) and infection episodes were recorded, and kidney function was monitored during a 2-year follow-up. χ(2) test, t test and Kaplan-Meier analysis were performed with SPSS17.0 software.\nRESULTS: Median follow-up was 338 days. In both the alemtuzumab group and ATG group, creatinine and blood urea nitrogen values in surviving recipients were similar (P > 0.05). White blood cell counts were significantly reduced in the alemtuzumab group for the most time points up to 6 months (P < 0.05). One patient receiving alemtuzumab died for acute myocardial infarction at the 65th day post-operation. Two ATG patients died for severe pulmonary infection or cardiac and pulmonary failure. Cumulative 2-year graft survival rate was 90.9% in the alemtuzumab group and 81.8% in ATG group (P > 0.05) respectively. There was one graft failure in the alemtuzumab group and two graft failures in ATG group, with all graft failures at tributed to rejection episodes. The alemtuzumab group had a 2-year cumulative freedom from rejection rate of 81.8%, compared with 72.7% for the ATG group (P > 0.05).\nCONCLUSION: Alemtuzumab induction therapy for highly sensitized kidney transplant recipients is an effective and safe protocol yielding an acceptable acute rejection rate.",

Outcomes were stratified based on the presence of CKD, defined as a baseline glomerular filtration rate (GFR) < 60 ml\/min\/1.73 m².\nRESULTS: The mean follow-up was 22.7 months. CKD was present in 165 patients (32.7%). Patients with CKD were older, had a higher incidence of hypertension and diabetes.

        "Abstract":"INTRODUCTION: The impact of drug-eluting stents (DES) has not been extensively investigated in patients with moderate to severe renal dysfunction, as these patients are consistently excluded from randomised studies. We sought to assess prospectively the effectiveness and safety of the new-generation DES in patients with moderate chronic kidney disease (CKD) and an isolated de novo lesion in the proximal segment of the left anterior descending artery (pLAD).\nMETHODS: We evaluated 400 consecutive patients with a pLAD lesion. There were 96 patients with moderate CKD (estimated glomerular filtration rate 59 ml\/min\/1.73 m2) and 304 without CKD. Major adverse cardiac events (MACE) were defined as death, non-fatal myocardial infarction and target lesion revascularisation (TLR). Clinical or telephone follow up was performed.\nRESULTS: There was a significantly higher incidence of mortality in patients with CKD (n=4) as compared with non-CKD (n=2) (4.16% versus 0.65%, respectively, p=0.03). The rate of non-fatal myocardial infarction was similar in the 2 cohorts (p=0.59), as was the TLR rate (p=0.99). Overall, there were no significant differences regarding MACE between the 2 groups of patients (p=0.19) during the 13.62 ± 6.22 month follow-up period. The rate of angiographic stent thrombosis was 2.08% in the CKD group versus 0.98% in the non-CKD group (p=0.59).\nCONCLUSIONS: New generation DES implantation in patients with CKD and a pLAD lesion is effective and safe, with rates of TLR and stent thrombosis comparable to those in patients with normal renal function.

However, data from clinical studies are conflicting. The aim of this study was to evaluate the safety of long-term clopidogrel and PPI therapy.\nMETHODS: A total of 1328 consecutive patients (age 63±11 years; 81% male) undergoing drug-eluting stent implantation and 1-year follow-up were included. All patients were treated with a standard aspirin and clopidogrel treatment regimen for 12 months. The concomitant PPI therapy for the same duration was at the discretion of the clinical cardiologist. PPI therapy included lansoprazole (30 mg\/day), pantoprazole (20 mg\/day), or omeprazole (20 mg\/day). At 1-year follow-up, major adverse cardiac events (MACE), defined as death, myocardial infarction (MI), acute coronary syndrome leading to hospitalization and nonfatal stroke, were recorded. All cause death, any stent thrombosis (ST), and bleeding (Thrombolysis in MI major and minor) were also assessed.\nRESULTS: Lansoprazole, pantoprazole, and omeprazole were administered to 855, 178, and 125 patients, whereas 170 were not prescribed any PPI therapy. Among patients treated with PPIs, those on pantoprazole had more often prior MI, multivessel coronary artery disease, and chronic kidney disease, whereas earlier peptic ulcer was more frequent among patients treated with omeprazole. The incidence of 1-year MACE was not statistically different between patients in the PPI and no-PPI groups (7.5 vs. 5.0%; P=0.26). Similarly, 1-year rates of all cause death, ST, and Thrombolysis in MI major and minor bleedings did not significantly differ. After statistical adjustment for potential confounders, the concomitant use of clopidogrel and PPIs was not associated with the risk of 1-year MACE [odds ratio (OR) 1.54, P=0.38], death (OR: 0.97, P=0.961), and ST (OR: 1.01, P=0.998).

ST predictors between one and two years were identified among 7,459 consecutively enrolled patients who received a TAXUS® Express2™ (Boston Scientific, Natick, MA, USA) DES. Six significant predictors were found: presence of renal disease, prior myocardial infarction, multiple stenting, bifurcation lesions, prior CABG, and smoking at baseline. Each predictor was assigned a score, then summed for a maximum possible score of 10. Stratification into low and high risk groups revealed that VLST developed in 0.5% of 6,759 patients with scores<5, and 2.6% of 700 patients with scores≥5.\nCONCLUSIONS: We defined a VLST risk score for patients during the second year post DES-placement that provides a useful tool for risk stratification.",

We evaluated the role of leukocyte filtration on hospital outcome and postoperative morbidity.\nMETHODS: Eighty-two consecutive patients who underwent isolated coronary artery bypass grafting were randomly assigned (1:1) to receive leukocyte filters on both arterial and cardioplegia lines or standard arterial filters during cardiopulmonary bypass. Hospital outcome, postoperative markers of morbidity, and biochemical assays were compared. Data were collected preoperatively, intraoperatively, and postoperatively. Costs for patients receiving intraoperative leukofiltration were compared with control patients getting standard arterial filters.\nRESULTS: Hospital mortality and intensive care unit and hospital length of stay were similar. Although duration of ventilation and incidence of pneumonia were comparable, leukocyte-depleted patients showed a higher ratio of arterial partial pressure of oxygen to fraction of inspired oxygen (p = 0.008) and lower need for postoperative noninvasive ventilation (p = 0.041). Control patients showed higher need for continuous furosemide infusion (p = 0.013) and for renal replacement therapy (p = 0.014), in association with higher serum creatinine (p = 0.038) and blood urea (p = 0.18) and lower glomerular filtration rate (p = 0.038). Leukocyte-depleted patients required lower doses of inotropic agents (p = 0.56), whereas troponin I leakage and incidence of postoperative atrial fibrillation were comparable. No differences were found in terms of postoperative cerebral dysfunction or neutrophil and platelet counts, as well as postoperative bleeding and need for transfusions. Finally, leukodepletion proved significantly cost-beneficial, with a 37% cost reduction.\nCONCLUSIONS: Although hospital outcomes were similar in terms of mortality and length of stay, the improvements in pulmonary, renal, and myocardial function, in association with the cost benefit, justify the use of leukocyte-depletion filters in the clinical practice.",

        "Abstract":"BACKGROUND: Acute kidney injury (AKI) after cardiac surgery is associated with increased morbidity and mortality.\nMETHODS: We assessed whether statin treatment is associated with a lower incidence of postoperative AKI in 2,104 consecutive patients who underwent coronary artery bypass graft or valve surgery at the Minneapolis Veterans Administration Medical Center. Acute kidney injury was defined as absolute increase greater than 0.3 mg\/dL or relative increase greater than 50% in serum creatinine from baseline, within 48 hours after surgery or requiring postoperative hemodialysis per AKI network. Propensity scores were utilized to adjust for the differences between the statin and the no-statin treatment groups. All statins were converted to equivalent-dose simvastatin and divided at the median to construct high-dose (≥40 mg) and low-dose (<40 mg) statin groups.\nRESULTS: Of the 2,104 patients, 1,435 (68%) were taking statins (638 high-dose) and 495 (24%) developed AKI (25% high-dose vs 40% low-dose vs 35% no-statin; p = 0.014). Estimated preoperative glomerular filtration rate (p = 0.003), diabetes mellitus (p=0.02), valve surgery with or without coronary artery bypass graft (p = 0.024), cardiopulmonary bypass time (p = 0.001), and intraaortic balloon pump (p = 0.055) were independent predictors of AKI. After propensity adjustment statin treatment was not associated with postoperative AKI (odds ratio 0.79; 95% confidence interval 0.59 to 1.06; p = 0.11 for high-dose v. no-statin). After full adjustment for all independent predictors of AKI, the results did not change. Statins also had no effect on the incidence of postoperative hemodialysis (0.8% high-dose vs 1.9% low-dose vs 1% no-statin; p = 0.15).\nCONCLUSIONS: Statin treatment is not associated with a lower incidence of AKI after cardiac surgery.",

        "Published":"2011-01-19",
        "Abstract":"BACKGROUND: Based on Acute Kidney Injury Network (AKIN) criteria, we considered acute kidney injury (AKI) as an absolute increase in the serum creatinine (sCr) level of more than or equal to 0.3 mg\/dl or 50%. The introduction of Urinary neutrophil gelatinase-associated lipocalin (UNGAL) has conferred earlier diagnosis of AKI. Pentoxifylline (PTX), a non-specific phosphodiesterase inhibitor, can suppress the production of some factors of inflammatory response and presumably prevent AKI. We examined the PTX on the development of AKI in cardiac surgery patients by measuring the levels of UNGAL.\nMATERIALS AND METHODS: We performed a double blind randomized clinical trial, enrolling 28 consecutive patients undergoing elective coronary artery bypass graft (CABG) surgery. Patients were divided into two groups, one to receive PTX 5 mg\/kg intravenous bolus injection, followed by 1.5 mg\/kg\/h continuous intravenous infusion until 3 hours after cessation of CPB and the other group received placebo. UNGAL was measured before, 3 and 24 hours after surgery. In addition serum creatinine was measured before and 24, 48, 72 and 96 hours after surgery and C-reactive protein (CRP) only 24 hours postoperatively.\nRESULTS: Both groups did not differ in demographic and baseline characteristics. 12 patients developed AKI 48 hours after surgery; 5 of them were in the intervention group and 7 in the control group (p= 0.445). There was an increase of UNGAL in both groups postoperatively, although not significant. Mean sCr was significantly increased in the control group at 24 and 48 hours after surgery (24-h mean: 0.79 ± 0.18 mg\/dl vs. 1.03 ± 0.43 mg\/dl, P value = 0.02; 48-h mean: 1.17 ± 0.24 mg\/dl vs. 0.98 ± 0.20 mg\/dl, P value = 0.03, respectively). PTX had a positive effect in preventing AKI reflecting in changes in sCr, and the increase of UNGAL was consistent with the emergence of AKI (Pearson's correlation = 0.30).\nCONCLUSION: Our study demonstrates a weak correlation between UNGAL and sCr after cardiac surgery. The rise of UNGAL in these patients may be reduced by administration of PTX although we did not show significance. PTX could reduce the occurrence of AKI as determined by attenuation of sCr rise without causing hemodynamic instability or increased bleeding. Overall, we suggest future studies with larger sample sizes to elucidate this effect and determine the different aspects of administrating PTX.\nTRIAL REGISTRATION: ISRCTN: IRCT138807302622N1.",

        "Abstract":"BACKGROUND: Left ventricle dysfunction and co-morbidities are responsible for a large number of complications after coronary artery bypass graft (CABG) surgery. The best strategy for these patients, including the use or not and type of extracorporeal circulation (ECC), the use of minimized ECC (MECC), or conventional ECC (CECC), remains unclear. The aim of the present study was to investigate the potential effect of on-pump beating-heart (OPBH) surgery with the help of MECC for CABG in patients with a high-risk EuroSCORE and to compare this strategy to three other different procedures, including OPCAB and MECC or CECC with cardiac arrest.\nMETHODS: Patients were included if their EuroSCORE was strictly >\" xbd=\"1427\" xhg=\"1404\" ybd=\"1477\" yhg=\"1440\"\/>9. Four groups were retrospectively compared: an OPCAB, an OPBH, a MECC and a CECC group under cardiac arrest.\nRESULTS: 214 patients, mean age 74.26 ± 8.5 years, 68.7% male, were operated. Mean EuroSCORE was 12.1 ± 2.9, left ventricular (LV) function 37.4 ± 12.3%, recent myocardial infarction (MI) 49.5%, renal failure 48.1%, chronic obstructive pulmonary disease (COPD) 42.2%, and peripheral vascular disease (PVD) 55.6%. Mean number of grafts per patient was 2.4 ± 0.7. Our study showed that it was possible, in very high-risk patients, to carry out revascularisation with OPBH similar to that using MECC or CECC under cardiac arrest (p=NS). This technique reduces troponin release (3.23 vs 6.56, p<0.01), postoperative myocardial complications (2% vs 8%, p<0.01), cardiotonic drug prescription (15.7% vs 31.3%, p<0.01), ventilation time (4.57H vs 6.48H, p<0.01) and length of stay (LOS) in ICU (2.16 vs 2.53, p=0.02).\nCONCLUSION: The OPBH method seems to be safe, secure and effective in this population of very high-risk patients, reducing early complications and multi-organ failure. OPBH surgery, combining MECC without aortic cross-clamping, makes it possible to perform complete revascularization and is an interesting alternative for CABG in high-risk patients.",

Patients treated with both types of stents were excluded from the primary analysis.\nOUTCOMES & MEASUREMENTS: 2-year crude mortality risk differences (drug-eluting - bare-metal stents) were determined from vital statistics records, and risk-adjusted mortality, myocardial infraction (MI), and revascularization differences were estimated using propensity score matching of patients with severely reduced GFR based on clinical and procedural information collected at the index admission.\nRESULTS: 1,749 patients with severely reduced GFR (24% dialysis dependent) were treated with drug-eluting (n = 1,256) or bare-metal stents (n = 493) during the study.

Because the pancreatic graft is known to be the major cause of the high morbidity, we examined the incidence and treatment of pancreatic fistula (PF) in this retrospective analysis.\nMETHODS: From January 2004 to July 2010, we transplanted 52 pancreas grafts, including 50 SPK, 1 pancreas after kidney, and 1 pancreas transplantation alone. There were 22 female and 30 male patients with an overall mean age of 42.4 ± 7.4 years. The mean duration of diabetes was 27.3 + 8.1 years, mean duration of dialysis was 24.2 ± 28.6 months, and 14 cases were pre-emptive transplantations. All procedures were performed using systemic venous and enteric drainage.\nRESULTS: The incidence of clinically relevant PF was 16\/52 (30.8%), including 11 (68.8%) that were treated conservatively with a drain. Five patients (31.2%) needed relaparotomy: 2 due to enteric leakage, 2 due to acute abdominal pain with graft pancreatitis observed at laparotomy, and 1 due to acute hemorrhage. In 3 cases, graft pancreatectomy was necessary. Comparing the patients with (PF+) versus without (PF-) fistulas, there was no significant difference in cold ischemia time (10.9 ± 2.6 hours vs 10.4 ± 4.4 hours; P = .633), donor age. We found a significantly higher peak C-reactive protein (CRP) level in the patients with pancreatic fistula (3661.4 ± 3474.8 U\/L vs 821.8 ± 1293.7 U\/L, P = .022). The lipase concentration measured in the drainage fluid postoperatively showed a significant difference between the 2 groups (3661.4 ± 3474.8 U\/L vs 821.8 ± 1293.7 U\/L; P = 0.006). Also, the amylase concentration was higher in the PF+ group (1747.3 ± 3346.7 U\/L vs 265.3 ± 254.9 U\/L; P = .097). Graft loss occurred in 4\/16 cases (25.0%) of PF+ and 7\/36 (19.4%) of PF- (P = .719).\nCONCLUSION: The incidence of PF after pancreas transplantation is high and seems to be associated with ischemia-reperfusion injury reflected by peak-CRP. In most cases a conservative treatment is successful. The occurrence of a PF does not significantly impair graft survival.",

Increased perioperative rates of infections, thrombo-embolic complications, and bleeding disorders are reported. However, low patient numbers and lack of control groups limit all published studies.\nMETHODS: A total of 56 patients with a history of HM underwent cardiac surgery. As many as 29 patients suffered from non-Hodgkin lymphoma, five from Hodgkin disease, and 12 from myeloproliferative disorders, one from acute lymphatic leukemia, and nine from monoclonal gammopathy. Surgery consisted of coronary artery bypass grafting, valvular surgery or combination procedures. HM patients were matched to 142 controls. Matching criteria applied consisted of sex, age, main diagnosis, and co-morbidities.\nRESULTS: In-hospital mortality was elevated in HM patients though not reaching significance (P = 0.7). HM patients demonstrated increased rates of vascular, pulmonary, infectious complications (P > 0.1), and transfusion requirements (P = 0.077). The long-term survival of HM patients was significantly impaired (P = 0.043).

        "Abstract":"BACKGROUND: Chronic kidney disease (CKD) is strongly associated with adverse outcomes after percutaneous coronary intervention (PCI). There are limited data on the effectiveness of drug-eluting stents (DES) in patients with CKD.\nMETHODOLOGY\/PRINCIPAL FINDINGS: Of 3,752 consecutive patients enrolled in the Guthrie PCI Registry between 2001 and 2006, 436 patients with CKD - defined as a creatinine clearance <60 mL\/min - were included in this study. Patients who received DES were compared to those who received bare metal stents (BMS). Patients were followed for a mean duration of 3 years after the index PCI to determine the prognostic impact of stent type. Study end-points were all-cause death, myocardial infarction (MI), target vessel revascularization (TVR), stent thrombosis (ST) and the composite of major adverse cardiovascular events (MACE), defined as death, MI or TVR. Patients receiving DES in our study, by virtue of physician selection, had more stable coronary artery disease and had lower baseline risk of thrombotic or restenotic events. Kaplan-Meier estimates of proportions of patients reaching the end-points were significantly lower for DES vs. BMS for all-cause death (p = 0.0008), TVR (p = 0.029) and MACE (p = 0.0015), but not MI (p = 0.945) or ST (p = 0.88). Multivariable analysis with propensity adjustment demonstrated that DES implantation was an independent predictor of lower rates of all-cause death (hazard ratio [HR] 0.48, 95% confidence interval [CI] 0.25-0.92), TVR (HR 0.50, 95% CI 0.27-0.94) and MACE (HR 0.62, 95% CI 0.41-0.94).\nCONCLUSIONS: In a contemporary PCI registry, selective use of DES in patients with CKD was safe and effective in the long term, with lower risk of all-cause death, TVR and MACE and similar risk of MI and ST as compared with BMS. The mortality benefit may be a result of selection bias and residual confounding, or represent a true finding; a hypothesis that warrants clarification by randomized clinical trials.",

We investigated the efficacy of prophylactic intravenous (IV) N-acetylcysteine (NAC) and hydration for the prevention of CIN in patients with mild to moderate renal dysfunction who are undergoing coronary angiography and\/or percutaneous coronary intervention (PCI).\nMETHODS: A total of 220 patients who had mild to moderate renal dysfunction with serum creatinine (SCr) ≥ 1.1mg\/dL or creatinine clearance ≤ 60 mL\/min were randomized in 3 groups: 80 patients were assigned to IV NAC plus high-dose hydration with normal saline, 80 patients to only high-dose hydration with normal saline and 60 patients to standard hydration with normal saline (control group). The primary end point was the alteration of SCr level. The secondary end point was the development of CIN after the procedure.\nRESULTS: SCr levels changed the least in the NAC plus high-hydration group (P=0.004). The rate of the CIN in the NAC plus high-dose hydration group was also lower than the high-dose hydration group (P=0.006).

The age of wait-listed patients has risen progressively. The aim of this study was to evaluate the prevalence of cardiovascular disease in patients on the waiting list in our center before and after renal transplantation as well as the extent to which invasive treatment was required in these patients.\nMETHODS: The study investigated 2 groups: 350 patients on the renal transplantation waiting list at our center in 2008 and 324 patients who underwent renal transplantation at the same center in the years 2003-2007.\nRESULTS: In 2008, 141 women and 209 men with a mean age of 48.6 years (range 13-71 years) were on the waiting list. In the years 2003-2007, 98 women and 226 men with a mean age of 54.3 years (range 16-78 years) received renal transplants. One hundred six patients on the waiting list for renal transplantation had to undergo coronary angiography. There is no upper age limit for donors or recipients in our program. Mean age at admission on the waiting list was 48.6 years (range 13-71 years). Mean age at transplantation was 54.3 years (range 16-78 years) in our center. Most of these patients were asymptomatic but presented a risk profile that included diabetes mellitus, severe general atherosclerosis, a pathologic ergometric test, or abnormal myocardial scintigraphy. Only in 1 case could coronary heart disease be excluded. Seventy patients (20%) suffered from mild to moderate coronary heart disease without the need for intervention. In 5 patients (1.4%) coronary bypass surgery was necessary due to severe 3-vessel coronary heart disease. In 2 cases (0.6%) replacement of the aortic valve was performed because of aortic valvular stenosis. Coronary angioplasty without implantation of stents was done in 2 patients (0.6%). Twenty-two patients (6.8%) were treated with implantation of bare metal stents and 6 patients (1.7%) with drug-eluting stents. After renal transplantation, 22 patients (6.8%) suffered from peripheral arterial occlusive disease. In 58 patients, coronary heart disease was documented by angiography. 16 patients (4.9%) had 1-vessel disease, 23 patients (7%) 2-vessel disease, and 19 patients (5.8%) 3-vessel disease. Myocardial infarction was documented in 18 patients (5.5%) before and in 5 patients (1.5%) after renal transplantation. Bare metal stent implantation was performed in 6 patients (1.8%) after transplantation. One patient received a drug-eluting stent after renal transplantation. In the years 2003-2007, 22 patients underwent coronary bypass surgery before kidney transplantation.\nCONCLUSION: The prevalence of coronary heart disease is high in patients on the waiting list and after renal transplantation. The majority of these patients are clinically asymptomatic. One-third of the patients with coronary heart disease had to be treated invasively. Nevertheless, many diabetic patients are very sick from multiple complications after the waiting time, making theme unsuitable for transplantation.",

        "Abstract":"Neointimal hyperplasia causing recurrent stenosis is a limitation of the clinical utility of percutaneous transluminal coronary interventions (PCI). Nitric oxide (NO) inhibits smooth muscle cell proliferation, platelet activation, and inflammatory responses, all of which have been implicated in the pathogenesis of restenosis. In animals, neointimal proliferation after balloon injury has been shown to be effectively reduced by gene transfer of the inducible NO synthase (iNOS). The primary objective of this first multicenter, prospective, single-blind, dose escalation study was to obtain safety and tolerability information of the iNOS lipoplex (CAR-MP583) gene therapy for reducing restenosis following PCI. Local coronary intramural CAR-MP583 delivery was achieved using the Infiltrator balloon catheter. A total of 30 patients were treated in the study (six patients, 0.5 μg; six patients, 2.0 μg; six patients, 5.0 μg; and 12 patients, 10 μg). There were no complications related to local application of CAR-MP583. In one patient, PCI procedure-related transient vessel occlusion occurred with consecutive troponin elevation. There were no signs of inflammatory responses or hepatic or renal toxicity. No dose relationship was seen with regard to adverse events across the dose groups. Thus, coronary intramural lipoplex-enhanced iNOS gene therapy during PCI is feasible and appears to be safe. These initial clinical results are encouraging to support further clinical research, in particular in conjunction with new local drug delivery technologies.",

        "Abstract":"Whether drug-eluting stents are effective and safe in patients with moderate renal insufficiency (RI) is unknown. We performed a pooled analysis of data from 3 blinded randomized trials of sirolimus-eluting stents (SESs) versus bare metal stents (BMSs; SIRIUS, C-SIRIUS, E-SIRIUS) that included 1,510 patients. Clinical and angiographic outcomes were stratified by the presence of RI defined by creatinine clearance calculated by the Cockcroft-Gault formula (normal ≥ 90, mild 60 to 89, moderate < 60 ml\/min). Patients with baseline creatinine > 3.0 mg\/dl were excluded from these trials. Baseline mild RI was present in 517 patients (34.7%, mean creatinine clearance 75.7 ml\/min) and moderate RI in 228 patients (15.3%, mean creatinine clearance 47.2 ml\/min). Treatment with SESs resulted in lower rates of 8-month angiographic restenosis rates in patients with RI (mild RI 6.7% vs 42.6%, p < 0.001; moderate RI 9.7% vs 39.7%, p < 0.001) and without baseline RI (7.7% vs 37.2%, p < 0.001). One-year target vessel revascularization rates were similarly decreased with SESs in patients with (mild RI 4.7% vs 24.2%, p < 0.001; moderate RI 5.5% vs 26.9%, p < 0.001) and without (8.1% vs 22.4%, p < 0.001) RI, and this benefit was maintained at 5 years. Compared to patients with normal or mild RI, patients with moderate RI had higher rates of overall mortality and cardiac death at 1 year and 5 years (death 2.6% vs 0.6%, p <0.01, and 17.5% vs 6.3%, p < 0.01, at 1 year and 5 years, respectively; cardiac death 1.3% vs 0.2%, p = 0.05, and 6.6% vs 3.4%, p = 0.04, at 1 year and 5 years, respectively). However, there was no differential effect of SESs versus BMSs on any safety end point. In conclusion, patients with moderate RI have a nearly threefold increase in 5-year mortality after percutaneous coronary intervention compared to patients without RI. The effectiveness of SESs in decreasing restenosis compared to BMSs in patients with moderate RI was preserved and rates of death and myocardial infarction were not adversely affected.",

It is unknown whether short-term high-dose administration reduces the rate of pMI in patients with chronic kidney disease. Recently, we observed that in 304 patients with estimated creatinine clearance less than 60 ml\/min randomized to receive 80 mg\/day of atorvastatin or placebo for 48 h before elective coronary angiography and\/or angioplasty, statin administration did not reduce contrast-induced nephropathy (CIN). In this post-hoc analysis, we evaluate the pMI in the subgroup of 161 patients who underwent PCI.\nMETHODS: In all patients, creatine kinase myocardial isoenzyme (CK-MB) [upper reference limit (URL) 5 ng\/ml] was assessed before and at 12 and 24 h after PCI. The pMI, defined as CK-MB elevation more than three times the URL, occurred in 27 (17%) patients.\nRESULTS: The incidence of pMI was 10.4% (of 77 patients) in the atorvastatin and 23% (of 84 patients) in the placebo group (P < 0.05).

        "Abstract":"Coronary artery disease is the leading cause of death in developed countries and its incidence and severity is greater among older patients. So, because of the ageing of the population, clinicians will be increasingly confronted in daily practice with managing acute coronary syndrome in extreme old age and high-risk patients. Despite this demographic reality, several large randomized controlled trials evaluating the benefit-risk ratio of invasive versus conservative approach have systematically excluded elderly patients. The extrapolation of evidence-based medicine, initially focused on younger patients, is often contentious in this population and because of the lack of clear and specific recommendations in the elderly, the optimal management of STEMI in octogenarians remains a topic of debate. Elderly patients present unique issues related to the ageing process and multiple comorbid diseases making difficult the extrapolation of evidence obtained on younger demographics. Data from registries seem to support, nevertheless, the benefit of primary revascularization by PCI of the culprit lesion in \"selected\" octogenarians with a high technical success rate, few complications, acceptable short and long-term mortality rate and quality of life. Obviously, the \"ideal octogenarian\" doesn't exist and all the old patients are not suitable for an invasive approach. Managing elderly patients requires not only cardiological skills but also geriatric acknowledges and the individualized geriatric assessment is the corner store of the decision process. The aim is to screen for the presence of comorbidities (cognitive disorders, functional decline, anemia, renal insufficiency…), social isolation and existence of an underlying frailty. To conclude, the optimal strategy for the management of STEMI in octogenarians is not univocal: the best approach is the one that offers the greater benefits regard considerations of general health.",

We aimed to compare the clinical outcomes of BMS versus DES, as well as sirolimus-eluting stents (SES) versus paclitaxel-eluting stents (PES), in STEMI patients with renal insufficiency.\nMETHODS: From the Korea Acute Myocardial Infarction Registry, 874 STEMI patients with renal insufficiency (glomerular filtration rate < 60 ml\/min) comprising 116 patients with BMS and 758 patients with DES (430 SES and 328 PES) implantation were selected. Major adverse cardiac events (MACE) within 1 year, defined as composite of all-cause mortality, nonfatal myocardial infarction and target lesion revascularization were compared. In addition to multivariate adjusted analysis, propensity analysis for stent choice was performed.\nRESULTS: With a median follow-up of 342 days, 116 MACE occurred. MACE was more frequent in the BMS group than in the DES group before (HR [95% CI]=2.3 [1.3-3.8]) and after propensity score matching (HR [95% CI]=2.0 [1.0-3.8]). The difference of MACE was mainly driven by a higher rate of target lesion revascularization rate in the BMS group. In comparison between SES and PES, there was no significant difference between the 2 groups in propensity score-matched populations (HR [95% CI]=0.7 [0.4-1.1]).\nCONCLUSIONS: In STEMI patients with renal insufficiency, DES implantation exhibits a favorable 1 year clinical outcomes than BMS implantation, however, no difference was found between SES and PES.",

        "Abstract":"Although the optimal strategy for preventing contrast-induced acute kidney injury (CI-AKI) has not yet been established, the current strategy focuses on adequate periprocedural hydration, the use of a low amount of low or iso-osmolar contrast medium, and the application of adjunctive therapies, including hemofiltration, hemodialysis and drugs. Previous trials and meta-analyses concerning the use of the adenosine antagonist theophylline have revealed contradictory results. We sought to evaluate the effect of theophylline in CI-AKI prevention in well-hydrated elderly patients with chronic kidney disease. We therefore conducted a randomized, double-blind, placebo-controlled trial involving 56 patients who had been referred for cardiac coronary angiography and\/or angioplasty. 31 of these patients were randomly assigned to 200 mg theophylline IV before the procedure, and 25 to a placebo. The iso-osmolar contrast medium iodixanol was used. The primary endpoint was an increase in serum creatinine at study termination 48 h after contrast medium administration. Baseline characteristics in the placebo and theophylline groups were similar in terms of median age (75 years), estimated glomerular filtration rate (33 ± 10 vs. 33 ± 10 ml\/min\/1.73 m²; p = 0.87), diabetes mellitus (80 vs. 71%; p = 0.54), and amount of contrast used (94 ± 35 vs. 95 ± 38 ml; p = 0.89). There was no difference in serum creatinine at baseline (2.06 ± 0.59 vs. 2.02 ± 0.45 mg\/dl; p = 0.62) or study termination (2.06 ± 0.68 vs. 2.10 ± 0.53; p = 0.79). A prophylactic effect of theophylline was not observed. The incidence of renal impairment following exposure to the contrast medium was low. This fact can be attributed to adequate parenteral hydratation and the use of the minimum amount of contrast medium necessary.",

According to data of the available literature, elective open, i.e., conservative, reconstruction (OR) is followed by 3%-5% mortality, as well as by numerous comorbide conditions inside the early postoperative course (the first 30 days after the surgery) that occur in 20%-30% of the operated on. The aim of the study was to present preliminar results of a comparative clinical retrospective study of early postoperative morbidity and mortality in AAA reconstruction using endovascular (EVAR) and open surgical techniques.\nMETHOD: This comparative clinical retrospective study included 59 patients, electively operated on for AAA within the period January 2008-March 2009, divided into two groups. The group I counted 29 (49%) of the patients who had been submitted to EVAR by the use of Excluder stent. The group II consisted of 30 (51%) of the patients operated on using OR. All of the patients were males, 50-87 years old (mean 67.6 year in the group I, and 54-86 years (mean 68.3 years) in the group II. All tha patients had AAA larger than 50 mm, in the group I 50-105 mm (mean 68 mm), and in the group II 50-84 mm (mean 65 mm). Preoperative comorbide conditions of any patients were similar (coronary disease, obstructive lung disease, chronical renal insufficiency). Patients operated on as emergency cases due to rupture or due to symptomatic aneurysm (threthening rupture) were excluded. The analysed parameters were the duration of surgical operation, intraoperative and operative blood substitution, postoperative morbidity, the duration of postoperative hospitalization, and hospital mortality.\nRESULTS: The obtained results showed a statistically significantly shorter time taken by EVAR surgery (average 95 min, ranging 70-180 min) as compared to OR surgery (average 167 min, ranging 90-300 min). They also showed statistically significantly less blood loss in the patients operated on by the use of EVAR surgery (average blood compensation 130 mL, ranging 0-1050 mL) as compared to OR surgery (average blood compensation 570 mL, ranging 0-2.000 mL). Also, general complications as wound infection, no restoration of intestines peristalsis, febrility, proteinic and electolytic disbalance, lung and heart decompensation were statistically significantly less following EVAR than OR surgery. Postoperative hospitalization was also statistically significantly shorter after EVAR than after OR surgery (average 4.2 days, ranging 3-7 days; 10.6 days, ranging 8-35 days, respectively). Finally, within this 13-month study there was no mortality following EVAR surgery, while two patients died after OR surgery.\nCONCLUSION: In the patients with elective AAA reconstruction endovascular reconstruction is shown to be far more safer and minimally invasive procedure than open conventional aorta reconstruction.",

We conducted a retrospective analysis of our SBO database comparing 482 patients admitted to SS and 153 patients admitted to MS at a single institution over a 5-year period (January 2003 to December 2007). Study outcomes included length of hospital stay (LOS), time to surgery (TTS), hospital charges, incidence of bowel resection, and mortality. Both groups were comparable for age, gender, and race. The SS group had a shorter LOS (6.1 vs. 7.5 days; P = 0.01), less hospital charges ($29,549 vs. $35,789; P = 0.06), shorter TTS (log rank comparison; P = 0.006), and less mortality (eight [1.66%] vs. six [3.92]; P = 0.11). The SS group had more bowel resections (13.1 vs. 5.2%; P = 0.007). Coronary artery disease (CAD), acute renal failure (ARF), admission to SS, and female gender were significant predictors of bowel resection. CAD and ARF were significant predictors of mortality. Two hundred forty-four patients required operative intervention (surgery operative subgroup [SOS] 210 [43.6%], medicine operative subgroup [MOS] 34 [22.2%]). SOS and MOS were comparable for gender and race. SOS had shorter LOS (9.1 vs. 12.3 days; P = 0.02), less hospital charges ($46,258 vs. $62,778, P = 0.05), and less mortality (eight [3.81%] vs. four [11.76%]; P = 0.07). Bowel resection was comparable (SOS 30% vs. MOS 23%; P = 0.44). CAD and congestive heart failure (CHF) were significant predictors of bowel resection, whereas CAD was the only significant predictor of mortality in this subgroup. We recommend that patients with SBO be admitted to SS because this might translate to shorter LOS, earlier operative intervention, and reduced healthcare use direct cost. Bowel resection and death are more likely to occur in patients with comorbidities like CHF, CAD, diabetes mellitus, and ARF.",

Major in-hospital bleeding was defined as lethal or intracranial bleeding or bleeding requiring surgery or blood transfusion. Survival status of the 15 373 patients was obtained from the National Cause of Death Register. The number of patients receiving fibrinolysis as reperfusion therapy decreased from 4336 patients in 2001 to 733 in 2006. Cases of major in-hospital bleeding increased from 1.2% (including 0.7% lethal or intracranial) in 2001 to 4.0% (1.1%) in 2006, p<0.001. Higher age, female gender, hypertension, kidney failure, clopidogrel treatment before admission, pre-hospital administration of fibrinolysis and fibrin-specific fibrinolytic agents were identified as predictors for bleeding. Major in-hospital bleeding was the strongest predictor of adverse prognosis with a more than threefold increase in 1-year mortality.\nCONCLUSION: During 2001 to 2006 the use of fibrinolytic treatment markedly decreased while the incidence of major bleeding complications more than doubled. The latter might in part be explained by increasing use concomitant antiplatelet therapy, pre-hospital treatment and fibrin-specific fibrinolytic agents. Future close monitoring of bleeding complications is warranted, especially when considering the increased use of various combinations of antithrombotic drugs in conjunction with fibrinolysis and the great impact of bleeding on long-term mortality.",

        "Abstract":"Coronary artery disease (CAD) is the leading cause of morbidity and mortality in patients with chronic kidney disease (CKD), but no study has yet compared the short- and long-term outcomes of coronary artery bypass grafting (CABG) and percutaneous coronary intervention (PCI) with drug-eluting stents for multivessel CAD among non-hemodialysis-dependent (HD) patients with CKD. In our institution's registry, we identified 812 patients with CKD (glomerular filtration rate <60 ml\/min) who had undergone either CABG or PCI for multivessel CAD from May 2003 to December 2006. Of these patients, 725 had non-HD CKD, and 87 were hemodialysis-dependent. The rates of 30-day and long-term mortality, 30-day major adverse cardiovascular events, and hemodialysis dependence after revascularization were compared between these 2 groups by computing the hazard ratios from a Cox proportional hazards model and adjusting them for the baseline covariates and propensity score. After either CABG or PCI, 2.4% of the patients with non-HD CKD were hemodialysis dependent. Compared to PCI, CABG was associated with postoperative hemodialysis dependence (odds ratio 3.2, 95% confidence interval 1.1 to 9.3; p <0.001). However, among patients with non-HD CKD and 3-vessel CAD, those who underwent CABG tended to have a lower long-term mortality rate than those who underwent PCI (hazard ratio 0.61, 95% confidence interval 0.36 to 1.03; p = 0.06). In the patients with non-HD CKD treated for 2-vessel CAD, those who underwent CABG or PCI had a similar long-term mortality risk (hazard ratio 1.12, 95% confidence interval 0.52 to 2.34; p = 0.7). In conclusion, in patients with non-HD CKD and multivessel CAD, CABG led to better survival than PCI with drug-eluting stents, but CABG patients had a greater short-term risk of requiring permanent hemodialysis.",

Ischemia reperfusion injury in the context of cold ischemia time and acute calcineurin inhibitor (CNI) nephrotoxicity is a major factor predisposing to DGF. A drug regimen consisting of prostaglandin E(1) (PGE(1)) furosemide and dopamine has been used to reduce DGF after kidney transplantation. Prostaglandin E(1) has multiple anti-ischemic and tissue-protective abilities, furosemide improves diuresis, and dopamine augments renal blood flow and urinary volume. To evaluate a potential positive effect of this drug regimen on the primary function of cadaveric renal allografts, we performed a retrospective single-center study that compared 100 patients who received this regimen with a control group. The results showed no significant improvement in renal function. In contrast, plasma levels of creatinine and urea were increased in the drug regimen group. Thus, the effectiveness of PGE(1) in combination with high-dose furosemide and dopamine in diminishing DGF was not demonstrated in this trial.",

Two doses and two dosing modalities were evaluated.\nRESULTS: No drug-specific toxicities or increased adverse event rates were noted. Two YSPSL-treated patients died of causes determined as unrelated to study drug. YSPSL did not reduce the incidence of dialysis within the first week post-transplant (41% in treated vs. 20% in placebo patients). Renal function endpoints scored at post-operative days 1 & 2 were also not impacted by YSPSL. However, at day 5, the fraction of patients with serum creatinine above 6 mg\/dL was lower in the YSPSL vs. placebo group (26% vs. 55%, p = 0.043). Large variations in the dialysis-delayed graft function (DGF) rates were observed between centers, independently of treatment assignment, indicating subjectivity of this endpoint.\nCONCLUSION: In this first Ph2a study in kidney transplantation, YSPSL was safe but did not impact the dialysis-DGF rate. Further studies with more objective efficacy endpoints are required to define the impact of YSPSL on early renal allograft function.",

The purpose of this study was to compare the midterm clinical results of coronary artery bypass surgery (CABG) and PCI with DES in patients with chronic renal failure on hemodialysis.\nMETHODS: From January 2002 to December 2006, 29 patients underwent CABG, and 75 patients underwent PCI with DES. For CABG, 24 patients had off-pump surgery. The mean follow-up was 32.0 +\/- 22.0 months for CABG and 23.5 +\/- 14.8 months for PCI. Survival, cardiac death, major adverse cardiac events (cardiac death, myocardial infarction, revascularization), and target lesion revascularization were analyzed using the Kaplan-Meier method.\nRESULTS: Preoperative characteristics and risk factors were compatible between the groups except for the European System for Cardiac Operative Risk Evaluation (7.3 +\/- 2.7 for CABG and 5.0 +\/- 2.4 for PCI, p < 0.0001) and the presence of a left main trunk lesion (53.3% for CABG and 18.7% for PCI). Thirty-day mortality was 3.3% for CABG and 4.0% for PCI. The 2-year survival rate was 84.0% for CABG and 67.6% for PCI (p = 0.0271). The cardiac death-free curve at 2 years was 100% for CABG and 84.1% for PCI (p = 0.0122). The major adverse cardiac events-free rate at 2 years was 75.8% for CABG and 31.5% for PCI (p < 0.0001). During the follow-up period, there were 6 late deaths in the CABG group and 27 late deaths (including 6 sudden deaths) in the PCI group.\nCONCLUSIONS: Coronary artery bypass grafting was superior to PCI with DES in patients with chronic renal failure on hemodialysis in terms of long-term outcomes for cardiac death, major adverse cardiac events, and target lesion revascularization. The DES carried a higher risk for sudden death, which might be associated with stent thrombosis.",

In all patients only contrast preparation iodixanol was used and prevention of contrast induced nephropathy (CIN) was implemented. Immediate success of PCI was higher and comparable between groups. Rate of development of CIN turned out significantly higher in groups 2 and 3 (6.8 and 17.2% compared with 0.7% in group 1, <0.001). During 12 months of follow up restenosis rate was higher in groups 2 and 3 (15.9 and 27.6% compared with 6.6% in group 1, <0.001). Lowered GFR became predictor of long term (up to 3 years) mortality in patients with CKD as for group 2 compared with group 1 relative risk (RR) of death was 1.77 (95%CI 1.19-3.74, =0.001), and for group 3 compared with group 1 - 3.69 (95%CI 1.58-6.87), =0.001. In addition lowered GFR was predictor of nonfatal myocardial infarction (MI) up to 3 years: for group 2 compared with group 1 RR 1.69 95%CI 1.12-3.07, =0.009, for group 3 compared with group 1 RR 3.44 95%CI 1.37-6.19, =0.001. The conducted study showed that initially lowered GFR after stenting increased risk of development of CIN, led to rise of restenosis rate and repeat revascularizations up to 12 months, and also appears to be predictor of death and nonfatal MI in remote period up to 3 years.",

        "Abstract":"Minimized extracorporeal circulation (MECC, Maquet, Cardiopulmonary AG, Hirrlingen, Germany) is an established procedure to perform coronary revascularization. Studies showed positive effects of MECC compared to conventional cardiopulmonary bypass (CCPB) procedures in terms of transfusion requirements, less inflammation reactions, and neurological impairments. Recent retrospective studies showed higher mean arterial pressure (MAP) and a lower frequency of vasoactive drug use. We addressed this issue in this study. The hypothesis was to find a higher MAP during coronary bypass grafting surgery in patients treated with MECC systems. We performed a prospective, controlled, randomized trial with 40 patients either assigned to MECC (n = 18) or CCPB (n = 22) undergoing coronary bypass grafting. Primary endpoints were the perioperative course of mean arterial pressure, and the consumption of norepinephrine. Secondary endpoints were the regional cerebral and renal oxygen saturation (rSO2) as an indicator of area perfusion and the course of hematocrit. Clinical and demographic characteristics did not significantly differ between both groups. Thirty-day mortality was 0%. At four of five time points during extracorporeal circulation (ECC) MAP values were significantly higher in the MECC group compared to CCPB patients (after starting the ECC 60 +\/- 11 mmHg vs. 49 +\/- 10 mmHg, p = .002). MECC patients received significantly less norepinephrine (MECC 22.5 +\/- 35 microg vs. CCPB 60.5 +\/- 75 microg, p = .045). The rSO2 measured at right and left forehead and the renal area was similar for both groups during ECC and significantly higher at CCPB group 1 and 4 hours after termination of CPB. Minimized extracorporeal circulation provides a higher mean arterial pressure during ECC and we found a lower consumption of vasoactive drugs in the MECC group. There was a decrease in regional tissue saturation at 1 and 4 hours post bypass in the MECC group possibly due to increased systemic inflammation and extravascular fluid shift in the CCPB group.",

        "Abstract":"BACKGROUND: Early graft function is crucial for successful kidney transplantation. Maintaining adequate hydration is complicated by rapid movement of water to the extravascular space. We designed this study to test the effect of maximal hydration during graft ischemia time on early renal function.\nMETHODS: Forty adult patients with chronic renal failure underwent renal transplantation from related living donors. Study subjects were randomly assigned 1 of 2 regimens for intraoperative hydration. The constant infusion rate group received normal saline 0.9% at an infusion rate 10 to 12 mL . kg(-1) . h(-1) from the start of surgery until the renal vessels were unclamped after vascular anastomosis. The central venous pressure target (CVPT) group received normal saline 0.9% titrated to maintain a specific central venous pressure (CVP). The target CVP from the start of surgery until clamping of the donor renal vessels was 5 mm Hg except for the interval from clamping of the renal vessels until the end of renal vascular anastomosis, when the target CVP was 15 mm Hg. Perioperative hemodynamics, infused saline volumes, rate of infusion, onset of diuresis, graft turgidity, urine volume, and renal function during the first 5 postoperative days were recorded.\nRESULTS: At the end of renal ischemia time, both groups had received approximately 3 L crystalloid solution. The CVPT group achieved the highest peak of intravascular volume expansion with an average infusion rate of 48.3 mL . min(-1) during 48 +\/- 12 minutes of renal ischemia. The CVPT group had better graft function, required fewer vasopressors and diuretics, and had less postoperative tissue edema than the constant infusion rate group.\nCONCLUSIONS: Hydration directed toward maintaining a given CVP during kidney transplantation produced a more stable hemodynamic profile and promoted diuresis. The calculated infusion rate of approximately 45 to 50 mL . min(-1), within an hour ischemia time, seems feasible to enhance early graft function. A larger trial with long-term follow-up of renal function is warranted to confirm the clinical benefit of titrating IV crystalloid administration to maintain a given CVP in this population.",

In China, the benefit of intervention is still questionable, hence, this study investigated the prognostic significance of coronary angioplasty on outcomes of elderly patients presenting with ST-segment elevated myocardial infarction (STEMI). The study cohort comprised of 270 elderly (age >or= 75 years) patients who had confirmed STEMI. Some 116 patients underwent coronary angioplasty (called CA group) and their prognoses and survival over the short- and long-term periods (up to 80 months) were compared to 154 comparable patients who received a noninvasive, more conservative medical therapy (non-CA group). The subsequent Kaplan-Meier survival curves and statistical analyses were used to ascertain any difference between the groups. There was no significant differences between the two groups in terms of their clinical presentation, clinical risk, cardiac features, medications and medical procedures, except that the peak creatine kinase was significantly higher in the CA group. The success rate of interventional percutaneous coronary intervention observed in the CA group was 92.4% and during the hospitalization period, there were fewer deaths in the CA group (11 vs. 61 in the non-CA group). Furthermore, after 1-year and up to 7 years postsurgery, the CA group had a significant survival when compared to the non-CA cohort. Analysis of the longer-term data, using multivariate Cox regression analysis after 80 months indicated a hazard ratio of mortality for patients in CA group to be 0.283 (95% CI: 0.140-0.534, P < 0.001). Also, multivariate logistic regression analysis identified conservative treatment, chronic renal failure, cardiac arrhythmia, chronic lung disease and left ventricular ejection fraction, as predictors of higher long-term mortality in elderly patients with STEMI. In conclusion, this study clearly indicates that elderly Chinese patients with STEMI who undergo coronary angioplasty benefit and have a better survival rates in both the short- and long-term.",

The frequency with which patients delay filling a clopidogrel prescription after DES implantation and the association of this delay with adverse outcomes is unknown.\nMETHODS AND RESULTS: This was a retrospective cohort study of patients discharged after DES implantation from 3 large integrated health care systems. Filling a clopidogrel prescription was based on pharmacy dispensing data. The primary end point was all-cause mortality or myocardial infarction (MI). Of 7402 patients discharged after DES implantation, 16% (n=1210) did not fill a clopidogrel prescription on day of discharge and the median time delay was 3 days (interquartile range, 1 to 23 days). Compared with patients filling clopidogrel on day of discharge, patients with any delay in filling clopidogrel had higher death\/MI rates during follow-up (14.2% versus 7.9%; P<0.001). In multivariable analysis, patients with any delay had increased risk of death\/MI (hazard ratio, 1.53; 95% confidence interval, 1.25 to 1.87). Patients with any delay remained at increased risk of adverse outcomes when the delay cutoff was changed to >1, >3, or >5 days after discharge. Factors associated with delay included older age, prior MI, diabetes, renal failure, prior revascularization, cardiogenic shock, in-hospital bleeding, and clopidogrel use within 24 hours of admission.\nCONCLUSIONS: One in 6 patients delay filling their index clopidogrel prescription after hospital discharge after DES implantation. This delay was associated with increased risk of adverse outcomes and highlights the importance of the transition period from hospital discharge to outpatient setting as a potential opportunity to improve care delivery and patient outcomes.",

The risks of death and graft survival were not consistently reduced with exposure to statin using either adjusted models or propensity scores in Cox Proportional Hazards models.\nCONCLUSIONS: In a kidney transplant population primarily receiving tacrolimus-based immunosuppression, early statin use was not associated with significantly improved graft or patient survival.",

        "Abstract":"BACKGROUND: Although combination therapy for various cardiac conditions with dual antiplatelet therapy (aspirin and thienopyridine derivatives) and warfarin sodium has become increasingly popular, the safety and effectiveness of this aggressive treatment regimen remain unknown.\nMETHODS AND RESULTS: We retrospectively enrolled and analyzed 575 consecutive patients who had been implanted with drug-eluting coronary stents. The primary and secondary endpoints were major bleeding complications and major adverse cardiovascular events (MACE), respectively. At the time of discharge, 525 patients (91.3%) were prescribed with dual antiplatelet therapy, and 50 (8.7%) of them received dual antiplatelet plus anticoagulant therapy (triple therapy). The patients treated with triple therapy had a greater prevalence of comorbid conditions, including left ventricular systolic dysfunction and multi-vessel coronary disease compared to those on the dual antiplatelet regimen. During a median follow-up of 459 days, 14 (2.7%) patients receiving dual, and 9 (18.0%) receiving triple therapy reached the primary endpoint (p<0.001). These results show that warfarin use was associated with an increased risk of subsequent major bleeding. On the other hand, the incidence of MACE did not differ between the two groups (p=0.108 by the log-rank test). Multivariate analysis showed that renal impairment was an independent predictor of the risk of subsequent major bleeding in the triple therapy group.\nCONCLUSIONS: Triple therapy increased the hemorrhagic complications in patients after percutaneous coronary intervention with drug-eluting stents, especially in patients with impaired renal function. Great caution should be taken with patients who necessitate the addition of anticoagulation therapy with warfarin to dual antiplatelet therapy.",

        "Abstract":"BACKGROUND: Previous data on bleeding after percutaneous coronary intervention (PCI) have been obtained primarily from randomized trials that focused on in-hospital bleeding. The incidence of late bleeding after PCI, its independent predictors, and its prognostic importance in clinical practice has not been fully addressed.\nMETHODS AND RESULTS: We evaluated 22 798 patients aged >65 years who underwent PCI from December 1, 2003, to March 31, 2007, in Ontario, Canada. Cox proportional hazard models were used to determine factors associated with late bleeding, which was defined as hospitalization for bleeding after discharge from the index PCI, and to estimate risk of death or myocardial infarction associated with late bleeding. We found that 2.5% of patients were hospitalized for bleeding in the year after PCI, with 56% of bleeding episodes due to gastrointestinal bleed. The most significant predictor of late bleeding was warfarin use after PCI (hazard ratio [HR], 3.12). Other significant predictors included age (HR, 1.41 per 10 years), male sex (HR, 1.24), cancer (HR, 1.80), previous bleeding (HR, 2.42), chronic kidney disease (HR, 1.93), and nonsteroidal antiinflammatory drug use (HR, 1.73). After adjusting for baseline covariates, hospitalization for a bleeding episode was associated with a significantly increased 1-year hazard of death or myocardial infarction (HR, 2.39; 95% CI, 1.93 to 2.97) and death (HR, 3.38; 95% CI, 2.60 to 4.40).\nCONCLUSIONS: Hospitalization for late bleeding after PCI is associated with substantially increased risk of death and myocardial infarction. The use of triple therapy (i.e., aspirin, thienopyridine, and warfarin) is associated with the highest risk of late bleeding.",

We aimed to determine whether differences exist in the long-term mortality of patients with versus without DM who present with acute myocardial infarction and receive drug-eluting stents. Data were collected on 161 patients with and 395 without DM referred for primary percutaneous coronary intervention for acute myocardial infarction and treated with drug-eluting stents. The patients with cardiac arrest or cardiogenic shock were excluded. The 1-year major cardiac event (MACE) rates, defined as death, Q-wave myocardial infarction, or target lesion revascularization, were compared between the 2 groups. The patients with DM were sicker at baseline. The MACE rates at 1 year were significantly increased in those with DM compared to those without DM. This was primarily driven by all-cause mortality. No differences in Q-wave myocardial infarction, target lesion revascularization, stent thrombosis, type of drug-eluting stents used, or procedure-related renal failure were seen. No differences were found in death or MACE rates at 1 year after adjusting for age, gender, race, systemic hypertension, peripheral artery disease, and a history of chronic renal failure between the 2 groups (weighted log-rank statistic, p = 0.37 and p = 0.37, respectively). In patients presenting with acute myocardial infarction, those with DM were sicker than those without DM.

He had a forearm arteriovenous fistula at the right wrist which thrombosed 5 years ago. Digital ischemia was due to thrombus formation at the anastomotic site and migration into the downstream arterial bed. Heparine was initiated together with antiplatelet treatment. The ischemia resolved after a few days, no recidive was observed. Surgical ligation of the arteriovenous fistula was rapidly performed and antiplatelet treatment was maintained after surgery. After a follow-up of 6 months, the patient remained asymptomatic without new embolization. This observation underlines the necessity of clinical monitoring after access thrombosis and preventive surgical ligation might be discussed when the risk of distal embolization is high.",

Mean +\/- SD haemodialysis time was 3.9 +\/- 0.3 h in the ESRD group. Of 24 patients diagnosed with coronary artery disease in the non-ESRD group, 20 underwent percutaneous coronary intervention (PCI). A peak anti-Xa activity > 0.5 IU\/ml 10 min after enoxaparin injection was obtained in 90% and 93% of the non-ESRD and ESRD patients, respectively. The percentages of patients with peak anti-Xa activity in the target range (0.5 - 1.5 IU\/ml) were similar in the two groups (non-ESRD 80%, ESRD 93%). Adequate anti-Xa activity (> 0.5 IU\/ml) lasted about 2 h in both groups.

In the drug eluting stent (DES) era, the relationship among CKD, CRP, and long-term outcomes after percutaneous coronary intervention (PCI) has not yet been demonstrated. We investigated the combined effects of renal dysfunction and CRP on outcomes in patients who underwent PCI using DES.\nMETHODS: A total of 1859 patients (mean age 64 ± 10 years) who underwent PCI with DES between February 2003 and June 2006, were divided into 4 groups (quartile) according to estimated glomerular filtration rate (eGFR) and hsCRP at admission.\nRESULTS: The composite of cumulative death and non-fatal myocardial infarction (mortality+MI) during median follow-up of 27 months, was significantly higher in the lowest eGFR quartile than in the other three groups (hazard ratio (HR) for mortality+MI: 3.32, 95% CI: 2.21-5.00, P<0.001). Mortality+MI was also significantly higher in the highest hsCRP quartile (HR: 3.29, 95% CI: 2.02-5.37, P<0.001). A combined analysis of mortality+MI on the basis of hsCRP and renal function showed the exaggerated hazard in the combined worst quartile of hsCRP and GFR (HR of the combined worst quartile, 10.876, 95% CI: 3.74-31.63, P<0.001). Furthermore, both the lowest eGFR quartile and the highest hsCRP quartile were significantly associated with increased risk of stent thrombosis. In a multivariate analysis, low GFR and high hsCRP were independent predictors of mortality+MI after PCI with DES along with left ventricular dysfunction, diabetes, and left main disease.\nCONCLUSIONS: In an unselected cohort of patients receiving PCI with DES, poor renal function and high hsCRP were additively associated with a higher risk of hard endpoints and were independent predictors of mortality+MI even after correction for other factors. Our data suggest the importance of systemic factors on mortality even in the DES era.",

        "Abstract":"Chronic dialysis-dependent patients undergoing percutaneous coronary intervention (PCI) are at a greater risk of bleeding and ischemic events. Bivalirudin has been associated with fewer bleeding complications than unfractionated heparin (UFH) in patients undergoing PCI in various clinical settings. These studies, however, have systematically excluded patients dependent on chronic dialysis. We sought to assess the safety, bleeding rates, and in-hospital outcomes of bivalirudin use compared to UFH use alone in patients requiring dialysis and undergoing PCI. A retrospective analysis of 396 dialysis-dependent patients undergoing PCI from January 2000 to March 2009 was performed. Patients treated with a dose-adjusted bivalirudin regimen (n = 267) were compared to those treated with UFH alone (n = 129). The primary end point of major bleeding (hematocrit decrease > or = 15%, gastrointestinal or intracerebral bleeding) and the composite end point of in-hospital death, nonfatal Q-wave myocardial infarction, and urgent target vessel revascularization were compared between groups. The baseline characteristics were similar between the 2 groups, except for the proportion of men and nonsmokers and body mass index, which were greater in patients treated with bivalirudin. The rate of major bleeding was similar between the bivalirudin and UFH groups (3.4% vs 3.1%, respectively, p = 0.9). The rate of the composite end point (death, Q-wave myocardial infarction, urgent target vessel revascularization) was not significantly different between the 2 groups (1.8% for bivalirudin vs 0.8% for UFH group, p = 0.7). After adjustment, bivalirudin use was not associated with major bleeding (odds ratio 1.23, 95% confidence interval 0.37 to 4.13, p = 0.7). In conclusion, a dose-adjusted bivalirudin anticoagulation regimen for patients requiring chronic dialysis undergoing PCI seems to be as safe and as effective as UFH use alone. These results do not suggest the superiority of bivalirudin over UFH.",

Patients admitted for first-time CABG and receiving clopidogrel with or without aspirin, were prospectively randomized either to receive a total of 75,000 kallikrein inhibitor unit (KIU)\/kg aprotinin given intra- and postoperatively or 25,000 KIU\/kg aprotinin after the operation. Three hundred and ninety-nine patients aged 32-87 years (median 67 years) were included. Postoperative bleeding was slightly different, but moderate in both groups. The transfusion rate was similar, as were the incidences of postoperative neurological disturbances and myocardial infarction. Renal impairment and need for inotropic drugs were more frequent in the high dose group. Thirty-day mortality was similar (high dose 2%, low dose 0.5%, P=0.22).

Two-year follow-up was 94% with independent adjudication of major cardiac events. A second, autonomous committee adjudicated Academic Research Consortium (ARC) definite\/probable ST. Cumulative 2-year ARC-defined ST was 2.6% (1.0% early ST [<30 days], 0.7% late ST [31 to 365 days], and 0.8% very late ST [>1 year]). Simple-use (single-vessel and single-stent) cases had lower rates than expanded use (broader patient\/lesion characteristics, 2-year cumulative: 1.4% versus 3.3%, P<0.001; early ST: 0.4% versus 1.4%, P<0.001; late ST: 0.5% versus 0.8%, P=0.14; very late ST: 0.4% versus 1.0%, P=0.008). Within 7 days of ST, 23% of patients died; 28% suffered Q-wave myocardial infarction. Mortality was higher with early ST (39%) than late ST (12%, P<0.001) or very late ST (13%, P<0.001). Multivariate analysis showed anatomic factors increased early ST (lesion >28 mm, lesion calcification) and late ST (vessel <3.0 mm); biological factors increased very late ST (renal disease, prior brachytherapy). Although early ST (71.4%) and very late ST (23.1%) patients had dual antiplatelet therapy at the time of ST, premature thienopyridine discontinuation was a strong independent predictor of both.\nCONCLUSIONS: The relative risks of early and late ST differ.

We retrospectively assessed the risks of administering the drug to adult patients undergoing off-pump coronary artery bypass grafting (OPCABG).\nMETHODS: Aprotinin was administered as a bolus of 1 or 2 million kallikrein inhibiting units to 391 patients following median sternotomy; 370 control patients underwent surgery during the same time period without receiving aprotinin. No other antifibrinolytic agents were administered.\nRESULTS: Preoperative characteristics, length of ICU and hospital stay were similar between the mostly medium-risk aprotinin and the control patients. Postoperative cardiac, renal, neurological, and respiratory complications and hospital mortality occurred with comparable frequencies in both groups. Levels of myocardial enzymes during the first 72 h after surgery also did not differ significantly.\nCONCLUSION: Use of aprotinin in OPCABG was not associated with a higher incidence of hospital mortality, cardiovascular, renal, or other complications. Given the good safety profile in this large patient population we suggest that aprotinin could still be a valid antifibrinolytic treatment option in OPCABG.",

        "Abstract":"AIMS: Drug-eluting coronary stents (DES) have gained widespread use for the treatment of coronary artery disease. However, because of safety concerns and frequent \"off-label\" use data from \"real life,\" registries are necessary to monitor indications and outcome of DES in daily clinical practice.\nMETHODS AND RESULTS: We evaluated data from the German Cypher Stent Registry. A total of 10,894 patients treated with at least one sirolimus-eluting stent (SES) at 152 hospitals were included. Follow-up at a median of 6.4 months was available in 10,006 patients (92%). Median age was 64.8 years and 75.5% were male. Per lesion a mean of 1.09 +\/- 0.41 SES were implanted with a mean length of 21.1 +\/- 11.5mm. During follow-up, death rate was 1.8% and the rates of myocardial infarction or stroke were 2.1% and 0.5%. Any target vessel revascularization (TVR) was performed in 8.0% of patients. Independent predictors for death, myocardial infarction, or stroke were: cardiogenic shock, acute coronary syndromes, reduced left ventricular function, renal insufficiency, diabetes mellitus, advanced age, three-vessel disease, degree of stenosis, and prior myocardial infarction. Predictors for a TVR were: two- or three-vessel disease, target vessel = coronary bypass, advanced age, stent diameter, ostial lesions, indication in-stent restenosis, renal failure, and target vessel = left anterior descended artery.\nCONCLUSIONS: These results demonstrate that SES use in clinical practice is safe and effective. The main predictors of clinical events during follow-up are clinical parameters whereas as predictors of TVR mainly are angiographic parameters.",

This prospective, randomized, open-label and double-blinded study analyzed the renoprotective effects of furosemide infusion and intermittent bolus therapy administered with dopamine infusion in cardiac surgical patients.\nMETHODS: Between August 1, 2007 and July 31, 2008, 100 adult patients undergoing elective coronary artery bypass surgery (CABG) surgery with normal renal function (creatinine <1.4 mg\/dl) were enrolled in the study. The patients were randomized for the comparison of intermittent (Group 1, n=50, 1mg-3mg\/kg) and continuous infusion of furosemide (Group 2, n=50, 10mg\/ml). Continuous variables were expressed as mean+\/- SD and compared by unpaired Student's t test or ANOVA for repeated measures. Statistical significance was assumed if p value was <0.05.\nRESULTS: Renal replacement therapy (RRT) was used in 5% of patients (all in group 1, p=0.028). The 30-day mortality was 5%. Only 2 patients became hemodialysis dependent in group 1. Group 2 patients showed a continuous and higher urine output postoperatively than group 1 (p<0.001). Both groups had significant increase in peak postoperative serum creatinine values (p<0.001), however peak postoperative creatinine-clearance was significantly lower in group 1 (p<0.001).\nCONCLUSION: Acute kidney injury necessitating RRT makes a small percentage of patients undergoing cardiac surgery and if RRT is not required the survival is excellent. Continuous infusion of furosemide seems to be effective in promoting diuresis and decreasing the need for RRT. However further multicenter studies with different doses of furosemide are required to confirm these results.",

        "Abstract":"Chronic kidney disease (CKD) is a risk factor for poor outcomes in patients with coronary artery disease (CAD), but it is unknown whether CKD influences the efficacy of alternative CAD treatment strategies. Thus, we compared outcomes in stable CAD patients with and without CKD randomized to percutaneous coronary intervention (PCI) and optimal medical therapy (OMT) or OMT alone in a post hoc analysis of the 2,287 patient COURAGE study. At baseline, 320 patients (14%) had CKD defined as a glomerular filtration rate of <60 mL\/min\/1.73 m(2), as estimated by the abbreviated 4-variable Modification of Diet in Renal Disease equation. The patients with CKD were older (68 +\/- 9 vs 61 +\/- 10 years; p <0.001) and more often had diabetes mellitus (42% vs 33%; p = 0.002), hypertension (81% vs 65%; p <0.03), heart failure (13% vs 3.4%; p <001), and three-vessel CAD (37% vs 29%, p = 0.01). After adjustment for these differences, CKD remained an independent predictor of death or nonfatal myocardial infarction (hazard ratio 1.48, 95% confidence interval 1.15 to 1.90). PCI had no effect on these outcomes. Furthermore, at 36 months, a similar percentage of patients with CKD treated with OMT (70%) and PCI plus OMT (76%) were angina free compared to patients without CKD. In conclusion, CKD is an important determinant of clinical outcomes in patients with stable CAD, regardless of the treatment strategy. Although PCI did not reduce the risk of death or myocardial infarction when added to OMT for patients with CKD, it also was not associated with worse outcomes in this high-risk group.",

        "Abstract":"BACKGROUND: Percutaneous coronary intervention with bare metal stents (BMS) in patients with chronic kidney disease (CKD) has shown suboptimal results. Drug-eluting stents (DESs) might reduce the incidence of restenosis and therefore of target lesion revascularization in these patients. Of note, in patients with CKD, multiple concomitant individual variables may be responsible for neointimal hyperplasia after coronary stenting, thus making the comparison of BMS and DES in different patient groups difficult.\nSTUDY DESIGN: The RENAL-DES is a prospective, randomized, multicenter, not-sponsored study to directly compare the efficacy in the prevention of clinical restenosis, of everolimus-eluting stent (Xience V) and BMS with identical design (Multilink Vision), both implanted in the same patient with multivessel coronary artery disease and CKD in order to obviate the multiple and unpredictable baseline differences. The primary endpoint of the study is 9-month ischemia-driven target vessel revascularization.\nSAMPLE SIZE: The expected primary endpoint rates are 20% for BMS and 10% for DES. According to these estimates, with a significant level of 0.05, a sample size of 194 patients provides an 80% statistical power. Assuming a 10% dropout rate, the goal is to enroll 213 patients (426 treated vessels) from five Italian centers. As 20% of the patients will likely require stent implantation in three vessels, approximately 500 treated vessels will be analyzed.\nCONCLUSION: This intraindividual, randomized study will provide, for the first time, data on the efficacy, in the prevention of clinical restenosis, of DES compared to BMS in patients with multivessel coronary artery disease and CKD (ClinicalTrials.gov Identifier: NCT 00818792).",

One hundred forty-four patients with mild renal insufficiency (serum creatinine >1.1 to <2.0 mg\/dl) undergoing an elective coronary procedure were randomly assigned to the following 2 groups: standard hydration with sodium chloride plus single-bolus intravenous administration of sodium bicarbonate (20 mEq) immediately before contrast exposure (group A, n = 72) and standard hydration alone (group B, n = 72). The primary end point was development of CIN, defined as an increase >25% or >0.5 mg\/dl in serum creatinine within 3 days after the procedure. Incidence of the primary end point was lower in group A than in group B (1.4% vs 12.5%, p = 0.017). Incidence of adverse clinical events (acute pulmonary edema, acute renal failure requiring dialysis, and death within 7 days of procedure) did not differ between the 2 groups (0% vs 1.4%).

Various parameters were measured before and after surgery.\nRESULTS: There was no difference in mortality between the 2 groups, but post-operative complications were less frequent in the hANP group (p = 0.0208). In the hANP group, serum creatinine (Cr) was significantly lower and urinary Cr and Cr clearance were significantly higher from post-operative day 1 to week 1. The maximum post-operative Cr level and percent increase of Cr were significantly lower in the hANP group (p < 0.0001). Patients with Cr exceeding 2.0 mg\/dl included 1 in the hANP group and 8 in the placebo group, showing a significant difference (p = 0.0374). Four patients in the placebo group and none in the hANP group required hemodialysis, but the difference was not statistically significant.\nCONCLUSIONS: Continuous infusion of low-dose hANP from the start of cardiopulmonary bypass effectively maintained post-operative renal function.

Randomized trials comparing coronary artery bypass grafting (CABG) and percutaneous coronary intervention (PCI) have so far only included a minority of screened patients. Therefore, we analyzed data from 679 consecutive \"all-comer\" patients, who underwent PCI in at least two main vessels. Expected in-hospital mortality for CABG was calculated using the EuroSCORE and compared to the observed mortality rate during in-hospital as well as long-term follow-up.\nRESULTS: The patients were suffering from 2.5 +\/- 0.6 diseased vessels, and 2.8 +\/- 1.0 lesions were stented (32% of patients received at least one drug-eluting stent [DES]; 20% of lesions were treated with DES). Forty-seven percent of patients were treated for acute coronary syndrome (ACS) (N = 176 ST-elevation myocardial infarction [STEMI]; N = 140 non-ST-elevation myocardial infarction [NSTEMI]). The EuroSCORE was significantly higher in ACS patients compared to stable patients (logistic: STEMI 16.3 +\/- 17.2; NSTEMI 13.6 +\/- 13.0; stable CAD 3.9 +\/- 4.2). The observed in-hospital mortality (STEMI 13.0%; NSTEMI 2.9%; stable CAD 1.7%, P < 0.001) was far lower than the estimated 30-day mortality. Cox regression analysis identified an elevated logistic EuroSCORE (HR per quartile 2.7, P = 0.003), severely reduced left ventricular ejection fraction (HR 2.7, P < 0.001), elevated C-reactive protein (HR 1.8, P = 0.012), and chronic renal failure (HR 2.8, P = 0.001) as independent predictors of long-term mortality.\nCONCLUSIONS: The EuroSCORE, which is routinely used to estimate the perioperative risk of patients undergoing CABG, also predicts short- and long-term prognosis of patients undergoing MV-PCI.

The outcomes of patients with CKD and acute coronary syndromes (ACS) have not been well studied.\nMETHODS: In the ACUITY study, 13,819 patients with moderate- and high-risk ACS undergoing an early, invasive strategy were randomly assigned to 1 of 3 antithrombin regimens: a heparin plus a GPI, bivalirudin plus a GPI, or bivalirudin monotherapy.

        "Abstract":"Many patients with malignant gastroduodenal obstruction have an unresectable primary lesion and distant metastases, which may prompt palliative management to allow the patient to eat and to improve the quality of life. Intraluminal metallic stent implantation (MSI) under fluoroscopic guidance has been reported to be an effective option for symptomatic relief in these patients, with a good safety record. An alternative, dual interventional therapy (DIT), has been used during the last decade, in which prosthesis insertion is followed by intra-arterial chemotherapy via the tumor-feeding arteries. The aim of this study was to compare success rates, complication rates, and survival time between MSI and DIT in patients who presented with gastroduodenal obstruction from advanced upper gastrointestinal tract cancer. All consecutive patients with malignant gastroduodenal obstruction seen at our center between October 2002 and August 2007 were retrospectively studied. Patients were treated palliatively by either MSI or DIT by the patient's or the next of kin's decision. Outcomes included technical and clinical success, complication rates, and survival. Of the 164 patients with malignant gastric and duodenal outlet obstructions, 80 (49%) underwent stent insertion as the primary therapy, while the remaining 84 (51%) received DIT. Clinical characteristics were similar between the two groups. In the MSI cohort initial stent implantation was successful in 73 patients (91%), two stents were used in 5 patients, and delayed additional stent insertion for stent obstruction related to tumor overgrowth was required in 3 patients during follow-up. In the DIT cohort the technical success rate was 94%, 3 patients required two stents, and stent obstruction occurred in 2 patients after initial stent placement. Early postprocedural clinical success, indicated by average dysphagia score, improved significantly in both groups: MSI group, from 4.56 to 1.51 (P < 0.01); and DIT group, from 4.38 to 1.48 (p < 0.01). There were no short-term complications. Late complications including hematemesis (n = 3), migration (n = 12), and stent occlusion due to tumor overgrowth (n = 5) were evenly distributed between the groups. In the DIT group chemotherapy-induced neutropenia and transient renal dysfunction were detected in six patients, which improved after symptomatic management. Mean survival time after the procedure was 5.9 and 11.1 months for MSI and DIT, respectively (P < 0.001). In conclusion, both MSI and DIT offer effective palliation for malignant gastroduodenal obstruction, but DIT appears to offer superior survival over MSI alone. Ideally, a prospective randomized trial comparing these two techniques should be carried out to validate this result.",

Epsilon aminocaproic acid (AMICAR) was given by the anesthesiologist to the majority of the remaining 510 patients and was not recorded on the bypass record. Therefore, patients given AMICAR were not included in this study. Outcomes included renal dialysis after surgery and mortality. Risk factors were identified and compared to patients in a study published by Mangano in the New England Journal of Medicine (N Engl J Med 2006; 354: 353-365). Aprotinin vs. control group showed no significant difference in risk factors for diabetes mellitus, hypertension, creatinine level above 1.3 mg\/dl, or low ejection fraction. The percentage of patients requiring renal dialysis and mortality was less in Medical University of South Carolina (MUSC) patients than the other published study. Overall, the patients in the MUSC study had greater risk factors for renal failure, with the exception of patients with preoperative serum creatinine of >1.3 mg\/dl (8.3 vs. 15.1%). This study does not show the same risk for renal failure associated with aprotinin that has been published elsewhere.",

        "Abstract":"(1) The standard anticoagulant for preventing thromboembolic events after hip or knee replacement surgery is a subcutaneous low-molecular-weight heparin such as enoxaparin; (2) Dabigatran, a specific thrombin inhibitor, was recently licensed for oral prophylaxis in this setting, as dabigatran etexilate (mesilate), a prodrug; (3) The clinical evaluation of dabigatran in this indication is based on two comparative double-blind trials with similar protocols, comparing dabigatran 150 mg or 220 mg\/day versus enoxaparin in 3494 patients undergoing hip replacement surgery and 2101 patients undergoing knee replacement surgery. The results were virtually identical: compared with enoxaparin, dabigatran did not reduce overall mortality (almost zero in the different groups), the frequency of symptomatic pulmonary embolism (almost zero in the different groups), or the frequency of symptomatic deep venous thrombosis (0.1% to 1.2%); (4) There was no difference between the groups with respect to the frequency of severe bleeding (about 1.5%), hepatic disorders (about 4%), or acute coronary events (a few cases). But dabigatran was associated with surgical wound seepage in 7% of patients, versus 4.7% with enoxaparin; (5) The anticoagulant effect of dabigatran, and therefore the frequency of haemorrhage, increases with age and in cases of renal failure. However, clinical trials included relatively few elderly patients and\/or patients with renal failure, who nonetheless represent a large proportion of the candidates for hip or knee replacement; (6) Dabigatran becomes more potent when combined with P-glycoprotein inhibitors or with drugs that impair renal function. Combination with other antithrombotic drugs should be avoided. (7) Dabigatran is administered orally, while enoxaparin requires daily subcutaneous injections. Dabigatran therapy does not necessitate laboratory monitoring, while the platelet count must be monitored with enoxaparin. There is no known antidote for dabigatran overdose; (8) In summary, for the prevention of venous thromboembolic events after orthopaedic surgery, it is better to continue to use heparins, at least pending more thorough evaluation of dabigatran.",

Renal stenting will be performed under angiographic imaging. For patients randomised to best medical treatment the degree of stenosis measured by renal duplex sonography (RDS) will be confirmed by MR angio or multi-slice CT where possible. Best medical treatment will be initiated at randomisation or post procedure (for PTRAS arm only), and adjusted as needed at all visits. Best medical treatment is defined as optimal drug therapy for control of the major risk factors (blood pressure < or = 125\/80 mmHg, LDL cholesterol < or = 100 mg\/dL, HbA1c < or = 6.5%). Data recordings include serum creatinine values, eGFR, brain natriuretic peptide, patients' medical history and concomitant medication, clinical events, quality of life questionnaire (SF-12v2), 24 hour ambulatory blood pressure measurement, renal artery duplex ultrasound and echocardiography. Follow-up intervals are at 2, 6, 12 and 36 months following randomisation.The primary endpoint is the difference between treatments in change of eGFR over 12 months. Major secondary endpoints are technical success, change of renal function based on the eGFR slope change between pre-treatment and post-treatment (i.e. improvement, stabilisation, failure), clinical events overall such as renal or cardiac death, stroke, myocardial infarction, hospitalisation for congestive heart failure, progressive renal insufficiency (i.e. need for dialysis), need of target vessel revascularisation or target lesion revascularisation, change in average systolic and diastolic blood pressure, change in left ventricular mass index calculated from echocardiography, difference in the size of kidney (pole to pole length) measured by renal duplex sonography, total number, drug name, drug class, daily dose, regimen and Defined Daily Dose (DDD), of anti-hypertensive drugs, and change in New York Heart Association (NYHA) classification.

Patients were divided into two groups: A (n=418)--invasive strategy; B (n=384)--conservative strategy. All-cause mortality and major adverse cardiovascular events (MACE) were assessed at one year.\nRESULTS: Group B patients were older (73.0 [29-93] vs. 64.0 [27-86] years, p < 0.001), more frequently female and diabetic (35.9 vs. 26.0%, p = 0.002), and were more likely to have a history of myocardial infarction and heart failure. They also presented with worse renal function, lower hemoglobin levels and lower left ventricular ejection fraction (53.0 [45-59] vs. 57.0% [50-60]%, p < 0.001). In hospital mortality was significantly higher for this group (5.7 vs. 1.9%, p = 0.004). Group A had more smokers, more frequent history of percutaneous coronary intervention, higher total and LDL cholesterol, lower Killip class on admission and lower TIMI scores. They were more frequently treated with anti-platelet therapy and at discharge were more often under beta-blocker and dual anti-platelet therapy. Female gender (adjusted OR 0.46; 95% CI 0.27-0.78) and older age (adjusted OR 0.55; 95% CI 0.31-0.99), were independent predictors for a conservative strategy during hospital stay. One-year survival was higher for the invasive strategy patients (95.9% vs. 86.2%, log rank p < 0.001), as was one-year MACE-free survival (88.3% vs. 75.7%, log rank p < 0.001). According to two multivariate Cox regression analyses, opting for an invasive strategy during hospital stay conferred a 57% reduction in relative risk of death (HR 0.43; 95% CI 0.20-0.94), and a 56% reduction in relative risk of MACE (HR 0.44; 95% CI 0.26-0.77) at one year.\nCONCLUSIONS: Despite some imbalances between the groups, in our population an invasive strategy during hospital stay independently predicted a favorable one-year outcome.",

Two-year follow-up was 94%, with independent adjudication of major cardiac events, monitoring of patients with cardiac events and an additional 10-20% sample by site. Most ARRIVE cases (64%, n=4,794) typified expanded use based on patient\/lesion characteristics outside the simple use (single vessel\/stent) pivotal trial populations. These expanded use patients had higher 2-year rates than simple use patients for mortality (7.8% vs. 4.2%, P<0.001), myocardial infarction (MI, 3.9% vs. 2.2%, P<0.001), target lesion revascularisation (TLR, 9.2% vs. 5.4%, P<0.001), and stent thrombosis (3.3% vs. 1.4%, P<0.001). Among subgroups with renal disease, chronic total occlusion (CTO), lesion >28 mm, reference vessel diameter (RVD) <2.5 mm, multivessel stenting, acute MI, bifurcation, vein graft, or in-stent restenosis, TLR ranged from 3.8% to 8.9% in year one, and from 1.3% to 6.0% during year two.\nCONCLUSIONS: Mortality and stent-related events were higher in expanded use than simple use patients in the pivotal trials.

Enrollment occurred between January 1, 2002, and December 31, 2004.\nINTERVENTIONS: Treatment with or without oral administration of nicorandil, 15 mg\/d.\nOUTCOMES & MEASUREMENTS: The primary end point was cardiac death (sudden cardiac death or death from acute myocardial infarction or congestive heart failure). The secondary end point was all-cause death. End-point adjudication was performed masked to the intervention.\nRESULTS: 129 patients (91 men, 38 women) with a mean age of 66 +\/- 9 (SD) years.

However, the frequency and efficacy of provisional GP IIb\/IIIa inhibition in addition to the full-dose bivalirudin in current practice is not well established.\nMETHODS: Using the 2004\/2005 Cornell Angioplasty Registry, we studied 1,340 consecutive patients undergoing urgent or elective PCI with periprocedural use of bivalirudin. We excluded patients presenting with an acute ST-elevation myocardial infarction (MI) within < or = 24 hours, hemodynamic instability\/shock, thrombolytic therapy within < or = 7 days, or renal insufficiency. Mean clinical follow up was 24.2 +\/- 7.7 months.\nRESULTS: Of the study cohort, 1,184 patients (88.4%) received bivalirudin alone and 156 (11.6%) received bivalirudin plus bailout GP IIb\/IIIa blockade. DES were used in 86% of PCIs. The incidence of in-hospital mortality (0% vs. 0.3% p = 1.000), MI (7.1% vs. 6.6%; p = 0.864), and the combined endpoint of death, stroke, emergent coronary artery bypass graft surgery (CABG)\/PCI, or MI (7.1% vs. 6.9%; p = 0.868) were similar in the bivalirudin-plus-bailout GP IIb\/IIIa inhibitor versus the bivalirudin-alone arm. There was a higher incidence of bleeding complications (16.0% vs. 9.6%; p = 0.018) in the bivalirudin-plus-bailout GP IIb\/IIIa versus the bivalirudin-alone group. At follow up, there were 4 (2.6%) deaths in the bivalirudin-plus-GP IIb\/IIIa inhibitor group versus 83 (7.0%) deaths in the bivalirudin-alone arm (HR 0.36, 95% confidence interval [CI] 0.13-0.98; p = 0.044). After multivariate Cox regression analysis, bailout GP IIb\/IIIa use in addition to bivalirudin was associated with similar long-term survival when compared to bivalirudin monotherapy (HR 0.41, 95% CI 0.15-1.12; p = 0.081).\nCONCLUSIONS: Provisional GP IIb\/IIIa use in bivalirudin-treated patients is higher in contemporary non-emergent PCI practice than that seen in randomized trials and is associated with similar in-hospital ischemic events, but more frequent bleeding events. These data suggest that a strategy of bivalirudin monotherapy is preferable in order to reduce bleeding complications, and GP IIb\/IIIa blockade should be reserved for patients with periprocedural complications in bivalirudin-treated patients undergoing PCI.",

However, these studies were largely conducted before the introduction of DES and aggressive antithrombotic therapy or were performed in the setting of randomized trials. With data from a contemporary registry, we evaluated the influence of CKD on major cardiovascular events and bleeding complications in unselected \"real-world\" patients undergoing PCI.\nMETHODS: Data from 4,791 patients enrolled in the EVENT (Evaluation of Drug Eluting Stents and Ischemic Events) Registry between July 2004 and September 2005 were analyzed. Patients were stratified into 4 groups: creatinine clearance (CrCl) >75, 50 to 75, 30 to 49 and <30 ml\/min.\nRESULTS: During the index hospital stay, there was a step-wise increase in bleeding complications with decreasing CrCl (3.3%, 5.0%, 8.8%, and 14.3%; p < 0.0001 for trend). Lower CrCl was also associated with more frequent death or myocardial infarction (MI) during the initial hospital stay (p = 0.001) and at 1 year (p < 0.001). These findings were confirmed in multivariate analyses that adjusted for baseline differences in demographic, clinical, and angiographic factors. Use of guideline-recommended medications at 1 year, including aspirin, clopidogrel, angiotensin-converting enzyme inhibitors, and statins, also decreased with declining renal function.\nCONCLUSIONS: Renal function is an independent and powerful predictor of bleeding and ischemic complications in the era of DES and contemporary antithrombotic therapy in patients undergoing PCI. The low use of guideline-recommended drugs among patients with CKD undergoing PCI might contribute to these adverse outcomes and warrants further evaluation.",

        "Abstract":"Heart failure (HF) is more prevalent and evolves more rapidly in patients with renal failure (RF). Renal failure not only produces myocardial damage, but also induces the development of clinical heart failure thus making the treatment of these patients more difficult. The incidence of HF in patients with RF is around 15%. Renal function in patients with RF is lower than in the general population. This is true for patients with preserved and depressed left ventricular ejection fraction (LVEF). HF mortality increases 30% for every 1-mg\/dL increase in creatinine and renal function should always be considered when assessing the cardiovascular risk and therapeutic alternatives of cardiovascular patients. Angiotensin converting enzyme inhibitors, Angiotensin receptor blockers and aldosterone blockers may cause acute renal failure and serum creatinine and potassium should be closely monitored. Chronic RF is a human model of accelerated atherosclerosis. It induces a rapid progression of coronary atherosclerosis and make atherosclerotic plaques more vulnerable to acute coronary syndromes (ACS) because of coagulation changes inherent to RF. Ischemia is also more frequent due to the imbalance between oxygen requirements and supplies. Chronic RF is associated with a worse outcome in patients with ACS and increases the risk of bleeding, and is associated with a higher mortality in patients under surgical or percutaneous coronary revascularization. Of the patients treated with an interventional coronary procedure (ICP), 3,3% suffer acute RF. Saline administration at a dose of 1 ml\/kg\/h for 12 hours before and 12 hours after ICP prevents the development of acute RF. Although the role of N-acetylcysteine is under discussion, taking into account the favourable risk profile of this drug, it seems reasonable to administer N-acetylcysteine in addition to saline administration. In ACS patients with severe RF, the risk of severe bleeding depends upon the anticoagulation regimen, increasing particularly when unfractionated heparin is used in combination with GP IIb\/IIIa inhibitors.",

For chronic hemodialysis (HD) patients, however, the impact of DES on clinical outcome is yet to be determined. Forty-six consecutive chronic HD patients who underwent myocardial revascularization in our institute were retrospectively reviewed. Twenty-eight patients underwent coronary artery bypass surgery (CABG) and 18 patients underwent percutaneous coronary artery intervention (PCI). Patient characteristics were similar between the two groups. In the CABG group, bilateral internal thoracic artery (ITA) bypass grafting was performed in 27 patients and off-pump CABG was performed in 20 patients. In the PCI group, a DES was used in 12 patients. The number of coronary vessels treated per patient was higher in the CABG group (CABG: 4.25 +\/- 1.32 vs. PCI: 1.44 +\/- 0.78; p < 0.001). Two-year survival rates were similar between the two groups (CABG: 94.1% vs. PCI: 73.9%; p = 0.41), but major adverse cardiac event-free survival (CABG: 85.9% vs. PCI: 37.1%; p = 0.001) and angina-free survival (CABG: 84.9% vs. PCI: 28.9%; p < 0.001) rates were significantly higher in the CABG group.

Mortality was similar between the clevidipine-nitrogylcerine- and clevidipine-nicardipine-treated groups, whereas mortality appeared to be greater in the sodium nitroprusside group compared to clevidipine (p = 0.04 in a univariant analysis). Clevidipine was significantly more effective in blood pressure control compared with nitroglycerin (p = 0.0006) or sodium nitroprusside (p = 0.003) and was associated with fewer blood pressure excursions compared with nicardipine as a predetermined blood pressure range was narrowed.",

        "Abstract":"BACKGROUND: A growing body of evidence suggests that hyperglycemia is an independent predictor of increased cardiovascular risk. Aggressive glycemic control in the intensive care decreases mortality. The benefit of glycemic control in noncardiac surgery is unknown.\nMETHODS: In a single-center, prospective, unblinded, active-control study, 236 patients were randomly assigned to continuous insulin infusion (target glucose 100-150 mg\/dl) or to a standard intermittent insulin bolus (treat glucose > 150 mg\/dl) in patients undergoing peripheral vascular bypass, abdominal aortic aneurysm repair, or below- or above-knee amputation. The treatments began at the start of surgery and continued for 48 h. The primary endpoint was a composite of all-cause death, myocardial infarction, and acute congestive heart failure. The secondary endpoints were blood glucose concentrations, rates of hypoglycemia (< 60 mg\/dl) and hyperglycemia (> 150 mg\/dl), graft failure or reintervention, wound infection, acute renal insufficiency, and duration of stay.\nRESULTS: The groups were well balanced for baseline characteristics, except for older age in the intervention group. There was a significant reduction in primary endpoint (3.5%) in the intervention group compared with the control group (12.3%) (relative risk, 0.29; 95% confidence interval, 0.10-0.83; P = 0.013). The secondary endpoints were similar. Hypoglycemia occurred in 8.8% of the intervention group compared with 4.1% of the control group (P = 0.14). Multivariate analysis demonstrated that continuous insulin infusion was a negative independent predictor (odds ratio, 0.28; 95% confidence interval, 0.09-0.87; P = 0.027), whereas previous coronary artery disease was a positive predictor of adverse events.\nCONCLUSION: Continuous insulin infusion reduces perioperative myocardial infarction after vascular surgery.",

The exclusion criteria included: history of AF, implanted pacemaker, myocardial infarction postoperatively, use of left ventricular assist devices and renal failure. The patients in the study group received 10 mmol of magnesium sulphate (2.47 gm) dissolved in 100 ml of saline solution infused intravenously over 4 hours, for 3 days.

        "Published":null,
        "Abstract":"PURPOSE: The aim was to identify factors that influence the efficacy of 600 mg of clopidogrel pretreatment in patients with stable coronary artery disease undergoing elective percutaneous coronary intervention.\nMETHODS: In a laboratory substudy of the PRAGUE-8 trial, the influences of nonmodifiable (age and sex) and modifiable (body mass index and tobacco smoke) factors, comorbidity (hypertension, hyperlipidemia, diabetes mellitus, and renal insufficiency) and cotherapy (statin, aspirin, and heparin), on the course of clopidogrel efficacy were investigated in 105 patients pretreated with clopidogrel >or=6 hours before coronary angiography +\/- percutaneous coronary intervention. Flow cytometric analysis of the vasodilator-stimulated phosphoprotein phosphorylation state was used. Independent predictors that influenced clopidogrel action were identified using linear regression.\nRESULTS: There was no correlation between baseline platelet reactivity index (PRI) and severity of coronary atherosclerosis; mean index of platelet reactivity for a nonsignificant lesion was 72% +\/- 5.98% and for a significant lesion 70.08% +\/- 8.43%. The highest proportion of low responders was patients with diabetes (50% at 28 hours). Among tobacco smokers, the response to clopidogrel occurred quickly and 80% of smokers had effective inhibition of PRI, 12 hours after drug use. After adjustments, tobacco smoking was an independent predictor for the most robust drop of PRI 12 hours after clopidogrel (P = 0.027). The magnitude of total decrease of PRI at 28 hours was not significantly influenced by cigarette smoking (P = 0.12). Linear regression showed that patients on statin therapy had a better response to clopidogrel than those without statins-the mean decrease of PRI at 28 hours was significantly higher (P = 0.02) among these patients (40.0 vs. 27.6).\nCONCLUSIONS: In stable coronary artery disease, no correlation exists between baseline PRI and the severity and extent of coronary atherosclerosis. A high loading dose of clopidogrel does not satisfactorily suppress enhanced PRI in patients with diabetes. Cigarette smoking is independently associated with a prompt antiplatelet response to clopidogrel. Ongoing statin therapy is an independent determinant of more effective clopidogrel-mediated inhibition of platelet reactivity.",

        "Abstract":"AIMS: Drug-eluting stents (DES) have never been sufficiently studied in patients with atrial fibrillation (AF). The latter are considered as a high-risk population with uncertainty over the optimal antithrombotic therapy strategy to prevent stroke, stent thrombosis, and recurrent cardiac ischaemia, balanced against the high risk of haemorrhage. The aim of this study was to evaluate the safety and efficacy of the use of DES vs. bare-metal stents (BMS) in a cohort of patients with AF.\nMETHODS AND RESULTS: We reviewed 604 patients with AF who had undergone percutaneous coronary intervention with stent over a period of 7 years (January 2001-January 2008). After a propensity score selection, we identified two matched cohorts who received DES (n = 207) or BMS (n = 207). Clinical follow-up was performed, and all bleeding episodes, thrombo-embolism, and major adverse cardiac events (MACE; i.e. death, acute myocardial infarction, target vessel failure) were recorded. Complete follow-up was achieved in 95.9% of the cohort (mean: 693 +\/- 427 days, median: 564). The incidence density of MACE as well as the incidence of all-cause mortality in both groups was similar. There was a higher incidence of major bleeding in DES group (2.26 vs. 1.19 per 10 000 days of exposure; P = 0.03). In a multivariate analysis, age, chronic AF, chronic renal failure, and non-use of dicoumarin were predictors of MACE and of all-cause mortality. The use of DES was not a predictor of reduced events.\nCONCLUSION: On the basis of this study, the routine use of DES in patients with AF does not seem to be justified. A higher risk of major bleeding with DES in comparison with BMS raises the possibility that DES should be limited to lesions or patients with a high risk of restenosis.",

Outcomes in patients > or = 75 y of age were compared with younger patients.\nRESULTS: Patients > or = 75 y of age (n = 115) were majority females (55% versus 21%, p < 0.001), more cases of diabetes (42% versus 27%, p = 0.004), hypertension (78% versus 65%, p = 0.03) and a history of coronary events (25% versus 15%, p = 0.002).

Bleeding complications were very low in both age groups if the radial access route was chosen. Multivariate predictors of 30-d mortality were cardiogenic shock\/survived cardiac arrest, ejection fraction < 30%, conservative treatment or unsuccessful PCI (OR 3.01), renal insufficiency, diabetes, and age.

        "Abstract":"Enhanced production and reduced removal of oxygen free radicals may play an important role in the pathogenesis of the contrast-induced acute kidney injury (CIAKI). Probucol, a lipid-lowering drug with potent antioxidant properties, has been widely used clinically for the prevention of the progression of atherosclerosis. We performed a prospective, randomized controlled trial to investigate the role of probucol in the prevention of CIAKI in patients undergoing planned coronary angiography (CAG) or intervention. The 205 patients who underwent planned CAG or intervention were randomly assigned to either the probucol group (n = 102; 500 mg orally twice daily) or the control group (n = 103). Renal function was assessed at the time of hospital admission and on days 1, 2, and 3 after the procedure. CIAKI occurred in 23 (11.22%) of the 205 patients. The incidence of CIAKI in the probucol group was slightly lower compared with the control group (7.84% vs 14.56%) but without significant difference (p = 0.13). The postprocedure mean peak of serum creatinine (1.15 +\/- 0.49 vs 1.33 +\/- 0.78 mg\/dl, p = 0.04) and the postprocedure increasing Scr from baseline (0.15 +\/- 0.22 vs 0.25 +\/- 0.21 mg\/dl, p = 0.001) in the probucol group were significantly lower than those in the control group. In conclusion, prophylactic treatment with probucol during the periprocedural stage in patients undergoing coronary angiography or intervention has a preventive role against CIAKI.",

Within 30 days, definite or probable ST occurred in 48 patients (1.4%). ST rates were not significantly different in patients treated with bare metal stents compared with drug-eluting stents (1.4% versus 1.4%; P=1.00) or with heparin plus glycoprotein IIb\/IIIa inhibitors (1.1%) compared with bivalirudin with or without IIb\/IIIa inhibitors (1.6% and 1.5%, respectively; P=0.26 and P=0.37, respectively). Compared with patients without ST, patients with ST more frequently had insulin-requiring diabetes mellitus and baseline renal insufficiency, a greater overall burden of coronary atherosclerosis, and suboptimal final angiographic results. ST also was more common in patients without preprocedural thienopyridine administration and with inconsistent antiplatelet drug use within 30 days. By multivariable analysis, the strongest independent predictors of definite ST were a smaller final stent minimal lumen diameter, a lack of preprocedural thienopyridine administration, the extent of coronary artery disease, and higher baseline hemoglobin level.\nCONCLUSIONS: Occurring in nearly 1 in 70 patients, early ST is relatively common in acute coronary syndromes, occurs with similar frequency after anticoagulation with either heparin plus glycoprotein IIb\/IIIa inhibitors or bivalirudin with or without IIb\/IIIa inhibitors, and is predicted by diffuse atherosclerosis, suboptimal angiographic results, and inadequate pharmacotherapy.",

Because the therapy of choice for prevention of CIN is controversial, in this study we compared the preventive efficacy of bicarbonate (Bi) infusion in dextrose water versus normal saline (NLS) infusion alone or in combination with oral acetazolamide (AZ).\nMETHODS: In a double-blind and randomized clinical trial, all patients undergoing coronary angiography or percutaneous coronary intervention received NLS (NLS group), its combination with AZ (AZ group) or infusion of Bi (Bi group) before the procedures. RIFLE (risk of renal failure, injury to the kidney, failure of kidney function, loss of kidney function, and end-stage renal disease) criteria were used to define CIN-associated acute kidney injury (AKI).\nRESULTS: The risk of AKI in CIN was significantly lower in the Bi and AZ groups than in the NLS group (P <or= 0.04). Comparing pre-treatment and post-treatment values in each group the following results were obtained: serum creatinine (Scr) increased and eGFR decreased significantly in the NLS group (P = 0.04) and in all patients (P = 0.001, P = 0.02, respectively). In addition, serum potassium decreased significantly in the Bi and NLS groups (P <or= 0.02).

Major bleeding and major adverse vascular events (all-cause mortality, myocardial infarction, repeat revascularization, stent thrombosis, or stroke) were collected during follow-up.\nRESULTS: We analyzed 166 consecutive patients with indication(s) for OAC (77% men; mean age, 71 years; range, 66 to 76 years) after undergoing PCI-S. CKD was associated with higher risk for major bleeding (hazard ratio [HR], 3.44; 95% confidence interval [CI], 1.50 to 7.93; p = 0.004) and all-cause mortality (HR, 3.50; 95% CI, 1.53 to 7.99; p = 0.003). In multivariate analyses, age > 75 years (HR, 2.75; 95% CI, 1.15 to 6.56; p = 0.023), CKD (HR, 2.59; 95% CI, 1.00 to 6.95; p = 0.049), anemia (HR, 2.36; 95% CI, 1.00 to 5.54; p = 0.049), and triple antithrombotic therapy (HR, 3.29; 95% CI, 1.23 to 8.84; p = 0.018) were independent predictors for major bleeding, whereas age > 75 years (HR, 2.38; 95% CI, 1.03 to 5.59; p = 0.046) and CKD (HR, 2.44; 95% CI, 1.03 to 5.82; p = 0.044) were predictors for all-cause mortality.\nCONCLUSION: In this high-risk population, CKD is independently associated with increased major bleeding and all-cause mortality following PCI-S.",

Severe complications occur that may influence short-term and medium-term morbidity and mortality in these patients. The aim of this study was to analyze the incidence of severe complications in emergency and nonemergency transplantations.\nMATERIALS AND METHODS: We studied 152 patients who underwent heart transplantation between 2001 and 2007. Combined transplantations and retransplantations were excluded. Two groups were considered: emergency transplantations (36 patients, 24%) and elective transplantations. We compared survival and occurrence of infection, primary graft failure (PGF), renal and hepatic failure, respiratory complications, cardiac tamponade, arrhythmias, reoperation, and intensive care unit (ICU) stay.\nRESULTS: The emergency transplantation group had a greater number of ischemic patients, with a more prolonged cardiopulmonary bypass time, and a larger proportion of donors were women. Overall mortality in the intensive care unit was 2.6%, with no differences between groups. However, emergency procedures were significantly associated with a higher incidence of PGF, need for intraaortic balloon pump, and a more prolonged mechanical ventilation time, as well as a greater number of bacterial infections and a significantly longer ICU stay.\nCONCLUSIONS: In our series, emergency transplantation showed no greater perioperative mortality. We observed a greater number of severe complications, such as PGF, bacterial infection, and more prolonged mechanical ventilation time.",

        "Abstract":"The prostaglandin I(2) (PGI(2)) analogue iloprost, a potent vasodilator and inhibitor of platelet activation, has traditionally been utilized in pulmonary hypertension and off-label use for revascularization of chronic critical lower limb ischemia. This study was designed to assess the effect of 72 hr iloprost infusion on systemic ischemia post-open elective abdominal aortic aneurysm (EAAA) surgery. Between January 2000 and 2007, 104 patients undergoing open EAAA were identified: 36 had juxtarenal, 15 had suprarenal, and 53 had infrarenal aneurysms, with a mean maximal diameter of 6.9 cm. The male-to-female ratio was 2.5:1, with a mean age of 71.9 years. No statistically significant difference was seen between the study groups with regard to age, sex, risk factors, American Society of Anesthesiologists (ASA) grade, or diameter of aneurysm repaired. All emergency, urgent, and endovascular procedures for aneurysms were excluded. Fifty-seven patients received iloprost infusion for 72 hr in the immediate postoperative period compared with 47 patients who did not. Patients were monitored for signs of pulmonary, renal, cardiac, systemic ischemia, and postoperative intensive care unit (ICU) morbidity. Statistically significantly increased ventilation rates (p=0.0048), pulmonary complication rates (p=0.0019), and myocardial ischemia (p=0.0446) were noted in those patients not receiving iloprost. These patients also had significantly higher renal indices including estimate glomerular filtration rate changes (p=0.041) and postoperative urea level rises (p=0.0286). Peripheral limb trashing was noted in five patients (11.6%) in the non-iloprost group compared with no patients who received iloprost. Increased rates of transfusion requirements and bowel complications were noted in those who did not receive iloprost, with their ICU stay greater than twice that of iloprost patients. All-cause morbidity affected 67% of patients not receiving iloprost compared to 40% who did. Survival rates were significantly better with iloprost than without in both 30-day (p=0.009) and 5-year cumulative (p=0.0187) survival. Iloprost infusion for 72 hr after open AAA repair was associated with improved systemic perfusion and decreased systemic ischemia. Patients had a significant survival benefit at 30 days and 5 years and significantly improved renal, cardiac, and respiratory function.",

The study cohort consisted of 6364 consecutive patients undergoing 7167 PCIs between April 2004 and August 2007.\nMAIN OUTCOME MEASURES: Clinical events including death, myocardial infarction (MI), target lesion revascularisation (TLR), target vessel revascularisation (TVR) and major adverse cardiac events (MACE) (a composite of death, MI and TVR), at 30 days and at 12 months.\nRESULTS: The cohort was predominantly male (74%), with a mean age of 64.7 years (SD, 12.0 years). DESs were used in 3482 (51.4%) of PCIs. In the overall cohort, rates of clinical events were low at 30 days: mortality (1.9%), MI (2.4%), TLR (2.0%), TVR (2.4%) and MACE (5.7%). At 12 months, event rates were: mortality (5.2%), MI (6.0%), TLR (5.8%), TVR (8.2%) and MACE (16.2%). Patients receiving DESs had similar mortality rates to those receiving BMSs (4.0% v 6.0%; P = 0.62 [propensity score-adjusted]); late thrombosis rates were also similar in the two groups (0.8% v 1.1%; P = 0.38). The proportion of patients receiving DESs fell significantly over time, from 54.9% in the first 24 months to 44.7% in the last 15 months of the study period (P < 0.01). Independent predictors of 12-month mortality included diabetes, renal failure, ST-segment-elevation MI and cardiogenic shock.\nCONCLUSION: Our clinical event rates were comparable with international registry outcomes. Rates of mortality and stent thrombosis were no higher in patients with DESs than those with BMSs. Although DESs were used in about half the procedures (preferentially for higher-risk lesions), recent trends suggest their use is in decline.",

On one hand, drug-eluting stents (DES) have emerged as a solution to the problem of restenosis after balloon angioplasty or bare-metal stent implantation, which was responsible for a higher rate of events (mainly repeat revascularization) in relation to CABG. On the other hand, off-pump bypass techniques and minimally invasive grafting of the left anterior descending artery appear to be safe and efficacious alternatives to traditional, on-pump CABG. Available literature includes studies outdated by current technologies, leaving the dilemma of best revascularization strategy unanswered in the general CAD population, but also in high-risk groups, such as diabetics and patients with chronic kidney disease. A number of ongoing trials, especially designed for this purpose, are set to end the debate, providing headto- head comparisons between DES-assisted PCI and contemporary bypass surgery.",

AT(1)-receptor antagonists have been demonstrated to be neuro- and renoprotective. Aim of ARTA, a prospective, double-blind, randomised and placebo controlled study, was to detect whether preoperative treatment with candesartan influences postoperative cognitive and renal function.\nSTUDY PROTOCOL: One hundred and five patients eligible for coronary artery bypass graft surgery (65-85 years old, all suffering from hypertension and coronary artery disease, with stable kidney function) were randomized to candesartan (8 mg od) or placebo for between 8 and 11 days prior to surgery. Existing ACE-inhibitor\/angiotensin receptor antagonist-therapy had to be stopped prior to the study. Validated cognitive function tests (trail making, Horn's perfomance III und VI, divided attention and change of reaction, memory - immediate and delayed recall, digit span) were performed preoperatively, 1 week and 3 months after surgery. Renal function was assessed by creatinine clearance on the day before, 1 week and 3 months after surgery.\nRESULTS: Eighty-seven patients (n = 43 Candesartan, n = 44 placebo) were included in the ITT-population for analysis. Drug treatment had no adverse effect on perioperative blood pressure. Only five patients experienced a period of hypotension during introduction of anaesthesia (Candesartan 1\/44, placebo 4\/44). One week as well as three months after surgery, there were no differences in relevant cognitive function parameters compared to the status prior to surgery, independent from treatment. Creatinine clearance showed a clear decrease one week after surgery with a minor further reduction observed 3 months after surgery, but there was no difference between Candesartan and placebo treated patients. Between both groups, there were no significant differences in the number of adverse events and number of patients with adverse events nor in the incidence of renal failure with consecutive dialysis and cerebral strokes (candesartan 2, placebo 5) and possibly drug related severe adverse events.\nCONCLUSION: This randomised placebo-controlled and prospective study in elderly patients does not support previous reports suggesting a substantial impairment of cognitive function after coronary artery bypass graft surgery. Preservation of cognitive and renal function was independent of pre-surgical administration of candesartan.",

All patients were studied with ambulatory blood pressure monitoring performed 24 hours before surgery and were divided into 2 groups according with presence (79 patients) or absence (51 patients) of dipper phenomenon. Non-dippers were defined as those with a nocturnal reduction of systolic and diastolic blood pressures of less than 10% of daytime pressures. Both groups were compared with each other from the aspect of postoperative need for intraaortic balloon counterpulsation (IABP), inotropic drug support, extubation time, length of intensive care unit and hospitalization stays, renal failure, stroke, malignant ventricular arrhythmia, atrial fibrillation, postoperative myocardial infarction and cardiac mortality. Statistical analyses were performed using Chi-square, unpaired t and Mann-Whitney U tests. Logistic regression analysis was performed to establish associations of non-dipper phenomenon with the risk of postoperative complications.\nRESULTS: When compared with the dipper patients, need for inotropic medications (37.5% vs. 62.5%), low cardiac output syndrome (30.4% vs. 69.6%), postoperative myocardial infarction (28.6% vs. 71.4%) and malignant ventricular arrhythmias (27.8% vs. 72.2%) were higher in the non-dipper patients (p<0.05 for all). Logistic regression analysis demonstrated that non-dipper phenomenon after CABG was associated with longer cardiopulmonary bypass time (OR=1.038, 95%CI 1.016-1,060, p=0.001), more need for postoperative inotropic agent (OR=4.014, 95%CI 1.235-13,047, p=0.021) and postoperative IABP (OR=6.625, 95%CI 1.564-28.069, p=0.01) support, higher risk of low cardiac output syndrome (OR=4.159, 95%CI 0.921-18.775, p=0.064), malignant ventricular arrhythmia (OR=4.653, 95%CI 0.964-22,456, p=0.056) and postoperative myocardial infarction (OR=7.629, 95%CI 1.448-40.177, p=0.017).\nCONCLUSION: Dipper and non-dipper phenomenon can be used as a simple analysis tool for assessing early postoperative mortality and morbidity.",

Further analysis was performed for 341 propensity score-matched pairs.\nRESULTS: There were substantial differences between the groups. Aprotinin patients were higher risk on account of older age, unstable symptoms, poor ejection fraction, preoperative hemodynamic support, emergency\/urgent operations, and combined coronary\/valve operations. Postoperative bleeding and blood product transfusion were considerably reduced in aprotinin patients, as was median duration of mechanical ventilation. Aprotinin was neither a predictor of postoperative myocardial infarction, renal insufficiency, neurologic dysfunction, or operative death. Achieving parity between the groups by propensity score matching eliminated the elevated rates of postoperative renal insufficiency, neurologic dysfunction, and operative death observed in aprotinin patients in the unmatched comparison. These adverse outcomes were evenly distributed between matched groups. Conversely, blood transfusion had univariate associations with all adverse outcome measures.\nCONCLUSIONS: Full-dose aprotinin use was not associated with myocardial infarction, neurologic dysfunction, renal insufficiency, or death after coronary or valve operations.

Clinical follow-up for 12 - 36 months showed that the overall survival free from MACE was 82.9% and the incidence of MACE in the BMS group was lower (5.3% vs 21.1%, P = 0.20). Multivariate regression analysis showed that the creatinine level (OR: 1.013; 95% CI: 1.006 - 1.020; P = 0.004) and hypertension (OR: 3.201; 95% CI: 1.000 - 10.663; P = 0.04) are two major factors affecting the long-term MACE.\nCONCLUSIONS: Percutaneous coronary stenting in patients aged over 85 years is safe and provides good short and long-term efficacy. Patients with renal dysfunction and hypertension may have a relatively high incidence of MACE.",

This study evaluates the impact of admitting team on outcome and cost.\nMETHODS: Three hundred seventy patients admitted to the Massachusetts General Hospital for CBDS or GP were retrospectively analyzed for demographics, insurance status, procedures, complications, length of stay, readmission, and cost. A multivariable analysis was conducted for outcome and cost measures.\nRESULTS: Patients admitted to a surgical service were younger than those admitted to a medical service. Gender, race, tobacco use, and the presence of chronic obstructive pulmonary disease and chronic renal insufficiency were not significantly different between groups. Patients admitted to a medical service had a higher incidence of coronary artery disease and diabetes. Despite lower readmission rates for surgical patients, there was no difference in total hospital days between groups. Though total cost of an initial surgical admission was greater than a medical admission, total cost attributable to the index admission diminished over time and ultimately was not significant in follow-up.\nCONCLUSIONS: Despite variations in uncomplicated management of CBDS and GP, there is no difference, in long-term follow-up, in the total number of hospital days or cost for the management of CBDS or GP based on admitting team practices.",

It makes it possible to calculate the incidence rate of events like recovery of renal function, myocardial infarction or death by using information from all subjects at risk for these events. It explains how the method works, how survival probabilities are calculated, survival data can be summarized and survival in groups can be compared using the logrank test for hypothesis testing. In addition, it provides some guidance regarding the presentation of survival plots. Finally, it discusses the limitations of the Kaplan-Meier method and refers to other methods that better serve additional purposes.",

Therefore, we studied the possible link between perioperative aprotinin treatment and renal dysfunction in patients undergoing first-time coronary surgery with a high risk of bleeding.\nMETHODS: We performed a matched cohort study, comparing 200 patients receiving high-dose aprotinin with 200 patients receiving tranexamic acid during primary isolated coronary surgery. Patients were matched according to age, sex, and presence of acute coronary syndrome. Primary outcome was fractional change in creatinine clearance. Secondary outcomes were other evaluations of postoperative renal function, mortality, stroke, reoperation for bleeding, and transfusion requirements.\nRESULTS: The groups were similar in baseline characteristics except that triple-vessel disease and history of myocardial infarction were more prevalent in the aprotinin group. No significant differences were found in fractional change in creatinine clearance (-11% versus -12%, medians, p = 0.75) or any other assessments of postoperative renal function between the tranexamic acid and the aprotinin group. Adverse event rates were similar: early mortality (3.5% versus 4.5%, p = 0.80), stroke (1.5% versus 2%, p = 1.0), reoperation for bleeding (3.5% versus 2.5%, p = 0.77), and 5-year survival (87% versus 84%, p = 0.17).

        "Abstract":"Proinflammatory cytokines and hyperhomocysteinemia are associated with clinically relevant restenosis in coronary artery disease. N-acetylcysteine (NAC) can decrease proinflammatory cytokines and plasma homocystine as well as reduce contrast-induced nephropathy. The aim of this study, therefore, was to compare normal saline hydration with and without intravenous NAC in terms of changes in renal function, proinflammatory cytokines, inflammatory markers, and plasma total homocysteine during coronary angiography. Forty-six patients who underwent coronary angiography and\/or stent implantation for unstable angina were enrolled and assigned to NAC or NS treatment groups based on normal saline hydration with or without intravenous NAC, respectively. The NS group had lower serum creatinine (Cre: p = 0.02) and plasma total homocysteine (tHcy; p < 0.001) and increased glomerular filtration rate (GFR; p = 0.003) after angiography. In the NAC group, the serum blood urea nitrogen (BUN; p = 0.001), Cre (p < 0.001), and plasma tHcy (p < 0.001) were lower, and the GFR (P = 0.013) was increased after angiography. There were no statistically significant differences in serum high-sensitivity C reactive protein (hs-CRP), tumor necrosis factor-alpha (TNF-alpha), or interleukin-10 (IL-10) before and after angiography in the NS and NAC groups. Intergroup comparison revealed that plasma tHcy level was lower for the NAC-treated patients (p = 0.002), with lower plasma tHcy level before and after treatment in this group (p < 0.001). Normal saline hydration can improve renal function and decrease plasma tHcy after coronary angiography with or without NAC; however, the combination of the two decreases plasma tHcy more than normal saline hydration alone.",

        "Abstract":"Lipid-lowering therapy prevents morbidity and mortality in patients with coronary artery disease (CAD), but little is known regarding ordering practices in patients hospitalized with CAD events. Patients at participating hospitals of Get with The Guidelines-CAD, a hospital performance improvement program, were entered into a registry. Factors associated with discharge lipid-lowering therapy prescription were identified and the effect of in-hospital low-density lipoprotein cholesterol measurement on therapy prescription was evaluated. A total of 98,880 patients were enrolled at 405 hospitals. At discharge, lipid-lowering therapy was prescribed in 84.7% of patients and was associated with percutaneous coronary intervention and angiotensin-converting enzyme inhibitor, aspirin, and beta-blocker therapies at discharge, but not cardiac rehabilitation referral or coronary artery bypass grafting (all p<0.0001). After adjustment for patient characteristics, men were more likely (odds ratio [OR] 1.23, 95% confidence interval [CI] 1.18 to 1.29; p<0.0001) and patients with heart failure were less likely to be prescribed lipid-lowering therapy (OR 0.64, 95% CI 0.59 to 0.69, p<0.0001). Patients who had low-density lipoprotein cholesterol measured during hospitalization were more likely to be prescribed lipid-lowering therapy (OR 1.56, 95% CI 1.48 to 1.65, p<0.0001). Lipid-lowering therapy prescription was associated positively with higher body mass index, history of dyslipidemia, and previous myocardial infarction and negatively with history of renal insufficiency, stroke, and hypertension. In conclusion, despite consistent benefits of lipid-lowering therapy in patients hospitalized for CAD events, discharge prescription varied by patient characteristics, in-hospital assessment, and treatment decisions.

Patients with critical limb ischemia (CLI) have a large atherosclerotic burden with related high mortality. The effect of such therapies in this population is largely inferred and unproven.\nMETHODS: The Project of Ex-Vivo vein graft Engineering via Transfection III (PREVENT III) cohort comprised 1404 patients with CLI who underwent lower extremity bypass grafting in a multicenter, randomized prospective trial testing the efficacy of edifoligide for the prevention of graft failure. Propensity scores were used to evaluate the influence of statins, beta-blockers, and antiplatelet agents on outcomes while adjusting for demographics, comorbidities, medications, and surgical variables that may influence drug use. Primary outcomes were major adverse cardiovascular events < or =30 days, vein graft patency, and 1-year survival assessed by Kaplan-Meier method. Potential determinants of 1-year survival were modeled using a multivariate Cox regression.\nRESULTS: In this cohort, 636 patients (45%) were taking statins, 835 (59%) were taking beta-blockers, and 1121 (80%) were taking antiplatelet drugs. Perioperative major adverse cardiovascular events (7.8%) and early mortality (2.7%) were not measurably affected by the use of any drug class. Statin use was associated with a significant survival advantage at 1 year of 86% vs 81% (hazard ratio [HR], 0.71; 95% confidence interval [CI], 0.52-0.98; P = .03) by analysis of both unweighted and propensity score-weighted data. Use of beta-blockers and antiplatelet drugs had no appreciable impact on survival. None of the drug classes were associated with graft patency measures at 1 year. Significant predictors of 1-year mortality by Cox regression modeling were statin use (HR, 0.67; 95% CI, 0.51-0.90; P = .001), age >75 (HR, 2.1; 95% CI, 1.60-2.82; P = .001), coronary artery disease (HR, 1.5; 95% CI, 1.15-2.01; P = .001), chronic kidney disease stages 4 (HR, 2.0; 95% CI, 1.17-3.55; P = .001) and 5 (HR, 3.4; 95% CI, 2.39-4.73; P < .001), and tissue loss (HR, 1.9; 95% CI, 1.23-2.80; P = .003).\nCONCLUSIONS: Statin use is associated with improved survival in CLI patients 1 year after surgical revascularization. Further studies are indicated to determine optimal dosing in this population and to definitively address the question of relationship to graft patency. These data add to the growing literature supporting statin use in patients with advanced peripheral arterial disease.",

Therapy with clopidogrel decreases adverse events in large patient populations. Therefore, we sought to determine the efficacy and safety of long-term clopidogrel therapy in patients with CKD.\nMETHODS: Two thousand two patients from the CREDO trial in whom an elective PCI of a single or multiple vessels was planned were analyzed. Patients were randomly assigned to a 300-mg loading dose of clopidogrel before PCI followed by clopidogrel 75 mg\/d for a year versus a placebo loading dose at the time of the PCI procedure and clopidogrel 75 mg\/d for 28 days and placebo for the remainder of a year. Patients were categorized by their estimated creatinine clearance (>90 [normal, n = 999], 60-89 [mild CKD, n = 672], <60 mL\/min [moderate CKD, n = 331]).\nRESULTS: Diminished renal function was associated with worse outcomes. Patients with normal renal function who received 1 year of clopidogrel had a marked reduction in death, myocardial infarction, or stroke compared with those who received placebo (10.4% vs 4.4%, P < .001), whereas patients with mild and moderate CKD did not have a significant difference in outcomes with clopidogrel therapy versus placebo (mild: 12.8% vs 10.3%, P = .30; moderate: 13.1% vs 17.8%, P = .24). Clopidogrel use was associated with an increased relative risk of major or minor bleeding, but this increased risk was not different based on renal function (relative risk 1.2, 1.3, 1.1).\nCONCLUSIONS: Clopidogrel in mild or moderate CKD patients may not have the same beneficial effect as it does in patients with normal renal function, but was not associated with a greater relative risk of bleeding based on renal function.

Drug-eluting stents (DESs) have been shown to decrease the incidence of restenosis in de novo native coronary artery lesions. However, their clinical value in SVGs remains to be established. We compared long-term clinical outcomes of percutaneous coronary intervention with DESs and bare metal stents (BMSs) for de novo lesions in SVGs. In a large prospective, multicenter registry, 360 patients underwent stenting of a de novo lesion in SVGs using BMSs (288 patients) or DESs (72 patients). Incidence of major adverse cardiac events (MACEs), including all-cause mortality, reinfarction, and target vessel revascularization, was recorded at a 12-month follow-up. Compared with the DES group, patients receiving BMSs were more likely to be men, to have chronic renal insufficiency or higher Charlson scores, but less likely to have undergone previous percutaneous coronary intervention. Incidence of MACEs at 12-month follow-up was similar in the 2 groups (17.8% in DES group vs 20.3% in BMS group, respectively, p = 0.460). Cox regression analysis identified age, chronic renal failure, cardiogenic shock at presentation, and ostial location of stenosis as independent predictors of long-term MACEs. In conclusion, our data suggest that rates of 12-month MACEs associated with the use of DESs and BMSs are similar in patients undergoing treatment of de novo lesions in SVGs.",

        "Abstract":"BACKGROUND: Sirolimus has been considered to be a non-nephrotoxic agent. It may delay graft function due to a potential hindrance of the recovery from acute tubular necrosis. It remains controversial as to whether the concomitant administration of sirolimus (SRL) with calcineurin inhibitors delays graft function in Asian patients.\nMETHOD: This study enrolled 61 patients who received primary renal transplantation. Twenty-one patients aged 38.9 +\/- 11 years received early treatment with 6 mg\/day sirolimus, 8 mg\/kg\/day cyclosporine (CsA) and prednisolone (SRL group). Forty patients with a mean age of 36.7 +\/- 9 years in the control group were treated with the standard immunosuppressive therapy (8 mg\/kg\/day CsA, mycophonolate mofetil and prednisolone).\nRESULTS: The creatinine level at one week following transplantation in the SRL group was not significantly different from that in the control group (4.7 +\/- 1.0 versus 2.7 +\/- 0.4 mg\/dL, p = 0.17). Similarly, there was no significant difference in the creatinine level at week 2 (3.4 +\/- 0.7 versus 2.7 +\/- 0.3 mg\/dL, p = 0.36), week 3 (2.0 +\/- 0.3 versus 2.1 +\/- 0.2 mg\/dL, p = 0.76), and week 4 (1.8 +\/- 0.2 versus 1.8+\/-0.1 mg\/dL, p = 0.92) between SRL and control groups, respectively. Similarly, the number of the patients with renal function impairment in both groups was not significantly different. The one-year patient and graft survival was 100% and 96%, respectively, in the SRL group and 100% and 98%, respectively, in the control group.\nCONCLUSION: The combination of sirolimus and cyclosporine did not prolong the recovery from transplantation-associated ischemic injury in kidney graft recipient. Our study demonstrated the safety of early usage of the concomitant administration of sirolimus and cyclosporine in kidney transplantation.",

The purpose of this study was to compare Framingham Risk Score (FRS), metabolic syndrome (MS), and cardiovascular events (CVE) in patients receiving early corticosteroid withdrawal (ECSWD), or chronic corticosteroid therapy (CCS).\nMETHODS: In all, 251 ECSWD and 146 CCS patients were evaluated. FRS and MS were identified at baseline, six, 12, and 24 months post-transplant. A total of 124 patients with diabetes mellitus prior to transplantation were excluded from MS analysis. CVE were defined as sudden-death, MI, angina, or CVA\/TIA. Repeat-measure logistic regression was used for statistical analysis.\nRESULTS: Fifty-four patients experienced 72 CVE. Mean follow-up was 755 +\/- 312 d and time to CVE was 14.8 +\/- 8.3 months. Demographics were similar between groups. FRS was not different between groups. CVE were significantly greater in CCS patients then ECSWD (20% vs. 10%, p = 0.024). New-onset MS occurred more frequently in patients receiving CCS then ECSWD (45% vs. 22%, p < 0.001) and was associated with more CVE (p < 0.015).\nCONCLUSIONS: Patients receiving ECSWD regimens have significantly decreased CVE and new onset MS compared with CCS.

The participant centers provided follow-up data for their patients treated with DES, reporting a detailed standardized form in the event of any angiography-documented DES-associated thrombosis occurring.\nRESULTS: Of 23,500 patients treated with DES, definite stent thrombosis(ST) developed in 301: 24 acute, 125 subacute, and 152 late. Of the late, 62 occurred >1 year(very late ST). The cumulative incidence was 2% at 3 years. Antiplatelet treatment had been discontinued in 95 cases(31.6%). No differences in incidences were found among stent types. Independent predictors for subacute ST analyzed in a subgroup of 14,120 cases were diabetes, renal failure, acute coronary syndrome, ST-segment elevation myocardial infarction, stent length, and left anterior descending artery stenting, and for late ST were ST-segment elevation myocardial infarction, stenting in left anterior descending artery, and stent length. Mortality at 1-year follow-up was 16% and ST recurrence 4.6%. Older age, left ventricular ejection fraction <45%, nonrestoration of Thrombolysis In Myocardial Infarction flow grade 3, and additional stenting were independent predictors for mortality.\nCONCLUSIONS: The cumulative incidence of ST after DES implantation was 2% at 3 years. No differences were found among stent types. Patient profiles differed between early and late ST. Short-term prognosis is poor, especially when restoration of normal flow fails.",

        "Abstract":"BACKGROUND: The Food and Drug Administration-approved argatroban dose for heparin-induced thrombocytopenia (HIT) is 2 microg\/kg\/min (0.5 microg\/kg\/min in hepatic impairment), adjusted to achieve activated partial thromboplastin time (aPTT) 1.5-3 times baseline. Recent data suggest that reduced doses are required after cardiovascular surgery.\nOBJECTIVE: To characterize dosing requirements, aPTTs, factors affecting dosage, and clinical outcomes in patients administered argatroban after coronary artery bypass graft (CABG) surgery.\nMETHODS: Charts of 39 patients who underwent CABG surgery and were administered argatroban postoperatively for laboratory-confirmed HIT (n = 25), antibody-negative suspected HIT (n = 10), or previous HIT requiring anticoagulation (n = 4) were retrospectively reviewed. Patient characteristics, argatroban dosing information, aPTTs (target range 45-90 sec), and outcomes were summarized. Regression analyses explored potential effectors of dosage.\nRESULTS: Patient features, argatroban dosing patterns, and aPTTs were similar among groups. Many patients had laboratory evidence of some hepatic and\/or renal dysfunction (median [range] bilirubin 1.0 [0.3-8.0] mg\/dL, creatinine clearance 47 [18-287] mL\/min). Overall, median argatroban doses were 0.5 microg\/kg\/min initially and 0.6 microg\/kg\/min during therapy (median duration 5.3 days). After argatroban initiation, aPTTs were greater than 90 seconds at first assessment in 4 patients (3 with abnormal hepatic function test results) initially administered 0.5, 1, 2, and 2 microg\/kg\/min, respectively. Within approximately 16 hours of therapy, 33 (85%) patients achieved consecutive therapeutic aPTTs. No association was detected between mean dose during therapy and preoperative ejection fraction, routine hepatic or renal function test results (other than blood urea nitrogen [BUN]), or surgery type. A clinically insignificant association existed between dose and BUN: there was an approximately 0.15 microg\/kg\/min dose decrease for each 10 mg\/dL BUN increase. One patient developed thrombosis, 1 underwent finger amputation, 7 died (5 after argatroban cessation), and 4 had significant bleeding.\nCONCLUSIONS: These findings suggest that reduced initial argatroban doses (eg, 0.5 microg\/kg\/min), adjusted to achieve therapeutic aPTTs, provide rapid, adequate anticoagulation in postoperative CABG patients with presumed or previous HIT. Prospective study of reduced initial dosing in this setting is warranted.",

        "Published":null,
        "Abstract":"BACKGROUND: Randomized controlled trials indicate that sirolimus-eluting stents (SES) reduce the rates of restenosis and need for subsequent revascularization procedures, but patients enrolled in randomized trials represent a highly selected population. This study examined the performance of SES in a 'real world' setting by comparing the outcomes of trial-eligible versus ineligible patients undergoing percutaneous coronary intervention.\nMETHODS: From the US commercial introduction of SES in April 2003 until December 2003, all patients that received an SES at our institution were followed in a prospective registry (n=838). For the purpose of this analysis, the registry population was divided into two groups based on the inclusion and exclusion criteria of the stenosis in a native coronary artery (SIRIUS) trial. The primary endpoint of the study was the rate of target lesion revascularization (TLR) at follow-up. Secondary endpoints included major adverse cardiac events (MACE) such as cardiac death, myocardial infarction, and target vessel revascularization. Clinical follow-up was complete for 92% of patients with a median duration of 14.2 months.\nRESULTS: Overall, 296 patients (35.3%) met entry criteria for the SIRIUS trial and thus comprised the SIRIUS eligible group. Patients in the SIRIUS ineligible group (n=542) were more likely to have chronic kidney disease and earlier bypass surgery and had longer mean stent length. At 1 year, TLR occurred in 3.0% of the SIRIUS eligible population and in 9.2% of the SIRIUS ineligible group (P=0.001). The secondary endpoint of cumulative MACE occurred in 6.6% of the SIRIUS eligible versus in 17.7% of the SIRIUS ineligible population (P<0.001). Two patients (0.4%) in the SIRIUS ineligible group had a late stent thrombosis on days 39 and 99, respectively, versus none in the SIRIUS eligible group.\nCONCLUSION: Among 'real world' patients treated with SES, the incidence of TLR and MACE at 1 year was substantially greater among SIRIUS ineligible patients compared with SIRIUS eligible patients. These findings confirm that pivotal clinical trials of drug-eluting stents tend to enroll low-risk patients and that the estimated rates of TLR and MACE derived from such trials may not reflect subsequent outcomes with unrestricted clinical use.",

        "Abstract":"Chronic kidney disease (CKD) creates one of the highest-risk atherosclerotic states that can occur in human beings. The use of 3-hydroxy-3-methylglutaryl coenzyme A reductase inhibitors (statins) has gained widespread acceptance in the general population for the purposes of lowering low-density lipoprotein cholesterol (LDL-C) and reducing the future risks of myocardial infarction, stroke, and cardiac death. In patients with CKD, these benefits are believed to be enjoyed to the same or greater degrees. Reductions in LDL-C with statins may be associated with a reduced progression of CKD. Importantly, recent studies suggest statins are associated with a reduction in rates of acute renal failure after cardiopulmonary bypass surgery and exposure to iodinated contrast. In patients with end-stage renal disease (ESRD), recent data suggest that the annual rate of coronary artery calcification can be attenuated or reduced with LDL-C reduction. However, two large trials demonstrating LDL-C reduction with statins and with these drugs have failed to demonstrate a reduction in cardiovascular events in ESRD. Thus, the potential benefits of statins and LDL-C reduction in CKD have to be considered in light of evidence suggesting a reduced benefit, if any, in patients with ESRD. In addition, studies suggest that there are higher adverse drug effects with statins in CKD.",

Recently, the value of interleukin (IL)-18 as a novel biomarker for the detection of acute renal failure has been highlighted. In the present study, we sought to investigate whether urine IL-18 may be an early diagnostic marker of CIN.\nDESIGN AND METHODS: We performed a nested case-control study using a hospital based cohort of all patients (n=157) admitted for elective PCI for stable angina to the Uludag University School of Medicine between February 2007 and June 2007. We identified 15 patients (9.5%) with CIN. Controls were matched with cases at an attempted 2.5:1 ratio by age and gender. Urinary IL-18 values were measured before as well as 24 and 72 h after the PCI.\nRESULTS: No statistically significant differences in urine IL-18 were detected between cases (n=15) and controls (n=36) or between the patient samples obtained before PCI and after the invasive procedure in both study groups.\nCONCLUSIONS: These findings argue against the hypothesis that urine IL-18 may be clinically useful as a biomarker of CIN after radiological procedures requiring intravascular administration of iodinated contrast media.

        "Published":null,
        "Abstract":"BACKGROUND: Several clinical trials have shown an association between the use of aprotinin in cardiothoracic surgery (CTS) patients and an increased risk of adverse renal, cardiovascular, and cerebrovascular events. Other antifibrinolytic agents-aminocaproic acid (AA) and tranexamic acid (TA)-have not shown elevated risks. Using a large administrative data set, we sought to examine these findings.\nMETHODS: In our observational database study of CTS patients who were discharged from 20 academic medical centers from October 2002 through September 2005, we assessed the use of antifibrinolytic therapy on select patient outcomes using descriptive and inferential statistics to compare the various groups.\nRESULTS: For the CTS patients, AA was used in 9,751 (15.5% of patients) and aprotinin was used in 6,855 (10.9% of patients). Only 17 patients from four hospitals received TA; therefore, TA was excluded from further analysis. A quarterly analysis showed a slow decline in the use of AA, with a gradual increase in the use of aprotinin over the study time period. Variation by hospital using each option was considerable (range, 0%-50%). Statistically significant differences in mortality rates (P < 0.001) occurred with AA (2.6%), aprotinin (5.2%), and control patients (n = 46,123), who did not use any antifibrinolytic agents (3.9%). Rates of acute renal failure were 6.2% with AA, 10.9% with aprotinin, and 6.1% in controls; hemodialysis rates were 2.8%, 6.4%, and 2.6%, respectively. Postoperative acute myocardial infarction occurred in only two cases of patients receiving AA, in none of those using aprotinin, and in 63 controls.\nCONCLUSION: Although the use of aprotinin has been increasing, compared with AA, the overall use of antifibrinolytic agents in patients undergoing CTS has remained relatively stable over a three-year period, at under 30%. Significant differences in patient outcomes were observed between the two treatment groups. Given the growing body of evidence for the use of antifibrinolytic therapy, hospitals might be best served by examining existing patterns of use and by instituting restrictions of aprotinin for patients facing an increased risk for bleeding during CTS.",

We investigated the effect of nifedipine infusion on glomerular filtration rate in patients with impaired renal function undergoing cardiopulmonary bypass surgery.\nMETHODS: Twenty patients accepted for coronary bypass and\/or heart valve surgery were enrolled prospectively and randomized to nifedipine infusion or no treatment. Males and females with creatinine 150 micromol L(-1) and 130 micromol L(-1), respectively, were included. Patients with unstable angina pectoris, ejection fraction 35% and those on dialysis were excluded. Glomerular filtration rate was measured preoperatively and 48 h postoperatively. Creatinine clearance was measured preoperatively and 0-4, 20-24 and 44-48 h postoperatively. There were no statistically significant differences in patient characteristics. Biochemical markers in plasma and urine were measured before and 48 h after surgery.\nRESULTS: The mean +\/- SD preoperative glomerular filtration rates were 32.2 +\/- 11.5 and 31.4 +\/- 17.0 mL min-1 per 1.73 m2 in the nifedipine and control groups (P = 0.90), respectively.

        "Abstract":"BACKGROUND AND AIM: It has been proven in various animal studies that recombinant human erythropoietin (rHuEPO) protects renal, cardiac and neuronal, as well as hepatic, tissue from ischemia, and promotes regeneration of adult central nervous system neurons. To date, no data are available as to whether rHuEPO has the ability to stimulate liver regeneration after liver resection.\nMETHODS: Rats undergoing 70% or 90% hepatectomy received an intraportalvenous administration (i.p.) of rHuEPO prior to resection or a subcutaneous injection (s.c.) for 3 days postoperatively, control animals were treated with surgery and saline injection only. Regeneration capacity of remnant livers was studied over 7 days by histology and immunohistochemistry (Ki-67, proliferating cell nuclear antigen [PCNA]). Polymerase chain reaction was carried out to measure transforming growth factor beta (TGF-beta), hypoxia induced factor (HIF), signal transducing activator 3 and vascular endothelial growth factor.\nRESULTS: Ten-day survival in rats undergoing 90% hepatectomy significantly increased in i.p.-pretreated animals. After 70% hepatectomy the mitotic index was significantly increased in both rHuEPO-treated groups. These data were confirmed by PCNA and Ki-67 expression, which was significantly increased in the treated groups 24 h and 2 days after liver resection. TGF-beta and HIF mRNA both were upregulated in control animals 3 h after surgery.\nCONCLUSION: rHuEPO effectively increased liver regeneration in rats after 70% liver resection and enhanced survival after 90% hepatectomy. Thus, rHuEPO may increase the regenerative capacity after major hepatectomy.",

We sought to evaluate (1) the temporal changes in medical management of patients discharged after an ACS; (2) patient and practice characteristics associated with optimal medical therapy at discharge; and (3) the association between discharge medication use and 1-year outcome.\nMETHODS: The Canadian ACS I (September 1999-June 2001) and ACS II (October 2002-December 2003) Registries were prospective, multicenter, observational studies of 6853 patients admitted for ACS. We examined the discharge use of medications among 5833 hospital survivors who did not have any contraindications to antiplatelet\/anticoagulant, beta-blocker, angiotensin-converting enzyme inhibitor, or lipid-modifying therapies. Optimal medical therapy was defined as the use of all indicated medications. Follow-up data at 1 year were collected by telephone interview. We performed hierarchical logistic regression to identify patient characteristics and care patterns associated with optimal medical treatment and to examine its relationship with 1-year mortality.\nRESULTS: There were significant increases in the discharge use of all 4 classes of medications over time; 28.9% and 51.8% of patients in ACS I and ACS II Registries, respectively, were prescribed optimal medical therapy (P < .001). Advanced age, female sex, prior heart failure, renal dysfunction, and coronary bypass surgery during hospitalization were negative independent predictors of optimal medical therapy. Conversely, enrollment in ACS II Registry, history of dyslipidemia, presence of ST elevation and abnormal cardiac biomarker, previous myocardial infarction, and previous coronary revascularization were independently associated with the use of combination therapy. After adjusting for other validated prognosticators, patients receiving optimal medical therapy had significantly lower 1-year mortality (adjusted odds ratio 0.54, 95% confidence interval 0.36-0.81, P = .003) compared with those given 0 or 1 drug at discharge. Over the 1-year follow-up period, substantial numbers of patients discontinued therapies, whereas others were initiated on treatment.\nCONCLUSIONS: Despite the temporal increases in the combined use of evidence-based pharmacologic therapies, which is associated with improved outcome, medical management of ACS remains suboptimal. Quality improvement strategies are needed to enhance the appropriate use of effective therapies, targeting specifically the high-risk but undertreated patients who may derive the greatest therapeutic benefit.",

        "Abstract":"BACKGROUND: Although aggressive endoluminal therapy for superficial femoral artery (SFA) occlusive disease is commonplace, the implications of diabetes mellitus (DM) on long-term outcomes in this population are unclear. We examined the consequences of endovascular treatment of the SFA in patients with and without DM.\nMETHODS: A database of patients undergoing endovascular treatment of the SFA between 1986 and 2005 was maintained. Three groups were defined: nondiabetic patients, those with non-insulin-dependent DM (NIDDM), and those with insulin-dependent DM (IDDM). Intention-to-treat analysis was performed. Results were standardized to TransAtlantic Inter-Society Consensus (TASC) and Society for Vascular Surgery criteria. Time-dependent outcomes were assessed with Kaplan-Meier survival analyses. Factor analyses were performed using a Cox proportional hazard model for time-dependent variables. Data are presented as mean +\/- SD where appropriate.\nRESULTS: Endovascular treatment (ie, balloon angioplasty +\/- adjuvant stenting in 38%) was initiated in 525 limbs in 437 patients (68% male; average age, 66 +\/- 14 years) for claudication failing conservative therapy or chronic critical limb ischemia (CLI). Of these, 50% were nondiabetic, 26% had NIDDM, and 24% had IDDM. Analyses were separated by those presenting with claudication (61%) and those presenting with CLI (39%). Among patients presenting with claudication, those with IDDM had significantly lower assisted primary patency (P < .01) and a higher incidence of restenosis (P = .04). Patencies at 3 years for nondiabetic, NIDDM, and IDDM were 62%, 72%, and 54% (primary), and 81%, 86%, and 65% (assisted primary), respectively. Patency and restenosis rates were associated with lesion calcification, TASC D lesion categorization, and acute periprocedural occlusion. Among patients presenting with CLI, patency and restenosis rates were equivalent across all groups; however, limb salvage was significantly worse for both groups of diabetic patients compared with nondiabetic (NIDDM, P = .01; IDDM, P = .02). Reduction in limb salvage rates was associated with presence of tissue loss at presentation, end-stage renal disease, and progression of distal disease on follow-up.\nCONCLUSIONS: Endoluminal therapy for SFA occlusive disease yields lower assisted patency rates and higher restenosis rates for those patients presenting with claudication who have more advanced diabetes (ie, IDDM). Among those patients presenting with CLI, particularly those with tissue loss, limb salvage rates are lowered for the diabetic groups (NIDDM and IDDM) despite equivalent patency and restenosis rates.",

        "Abstract":"Pedal bypass failure is not always associated with limb loss. Management of critical limb ischemia after failure is controversial. The aim of this study is to evaluate the results of redo bypass procedures to foot arteries in the absence of alternative tibial outflow arteries. Data of patients undergoing redo pedal bypass within a 14-year period were reviewed. The outcome after redo pedal bypass in patients whose original pedal bypass failed within 30 days versus those in patients whose original pedal bypass failed more than 30 days after the original pedal bypass were reviewed. Society for Vascular Surgery reporting standards were applied. Out of 335 pedal bypass grafts, 22 (6.6%) pedal redo bypass procedures were identified in 20 patients performed after previous pedal graft failure: 64% were male, mean age 67.7 +\/- 9.5 years, diabetes 90.9%, hypertension 90.9%, coronary disease 68.2%, renal disease 18.2%. Seven patients were operated for early failure and 15 for late failure (median 193 days). The graft conduit at the first operation was ipsilateral greater saphenous vein (GSV) in 18 (81.8%), alternative vein in three (13.6%), and one expanded polytetrafluoroethylene. Redo graft conduits were as follows: ipsilateral GSV in nine (40.9%), arm vein in six (27.3%), contralateral GSV in two (9.1%), \"other veins\" in two (9.1%), and homologous artery in three (13.6%). The same target artery was used in 81.8%, at the initial site in 54.5% and more distally in 27.3%. Redo revascularization for early failure was successful only once. Median follow-up after late redo was 23.7 months. Seven redo grafts performed after late pedal graft failure failed after a median of 115 days. The availability of adequate autologous conduit is the limiting factor for redo procedures. Lack of alternative outflow sites adds to the difficulty of target artery dissection. Redo pedal bypass surgery after early pedal bypass failure is associated with very poor patency and limb salvage. Acceptable patency and extension of limb salvage can be achieved with redo procedures for late pedal bypass failure.",

She presented with a combination of acral gangrene, foot ulcer, renal obstruction, mild pulmonary fibrosis, and reduced esophageal motility. Right-sided renal obstruction was evident. The condition was extremely painful and had led to muscular contractions and immobility, drug abuse, and anemia. After establishing the diagnosis of chronic gangrenous ergotism, changing drug therapy, mobilization, and treatment of chronic wounds, she showed a remarkable recovery. Eventually the foot ulcer was closed successfully using a mesh graft transplantation, and the patient was able to walk alone.

A control group for comparison comprised 54 consecutive dialysis patients with 58 lesions who underwent PCI using BMS. Angiographic and clinical follow-ups were scheduled at 9 months. After the procedure, minimum lumen diameter (MLD) was similar between the 2 groups. At follow-up, the SES group had a higher MLD than the BMS group (1.98+\/-0.83 mm vs 1.50+\/-0.78 mm, p<0.01).

Volume was added to the priming (500 mL) and given perioperatively until the second postoperative day to keep pulmonary artery occlusion pressure or central venous pressure between 12 and 14 mm Hg.\nMEASUREMENTS AND MAIN RESULTS: Serum creatinine and cystatin plasma levels were measured from arterial blood samples. From urine specimens, N-acetyl-beta-D-glucosaminidase, glutathione transferase-alpha, and neutrophil gelatinase-associated lipocalin were measured. Measurements were performed after induction of anesthesia, at the end of surgery, 5 hrs after surgery, and on the first and second postoperative days. A follow-up after discharge from the hospital (60 days) was also done. Similar amounts of hydroxyethylstarch and albumin were infused. Serum creatinine, glomerular filtration rate, and cystatin C plasma levels were without significant differences between the groups. Concentrations of kidney-specific proteins were elevated at baseline and increased significantly after surgery without showing group differences. Urinary levels of neutrophil gelatinase-associated lipocalin increased more in the albumin- than in the hydroxyethylstarch-treated patients. None of the patients developed acute renal failure requiring renal replacement therapy during the hospital stay and thereafter.\nCONCLUSIONS: A hydroxyethylstarch preparation with a low molecular weight and a low molar substitution given in cardiac surgery patients with preoperative compromised kidney function did not negatively influence kidney integrity compared with a human albumin-based volume replacement strategy.",

We investigated whether long-term outcomes after bivalirudin use remained comparable to heparin plus GP IIb\/IIIa blockade in current clinical practice of drug-eluting stent use.\nMETHODS: Using the 2004-2005 Cornell Angioplasty Registry, we studied 2504 consecutive patients undergoing urgent or elective PCI with periprocedural use of bivalirudin or heparin plus GP IIb\/IIIa platelet inhibitors. Patients presenting with an acute ST-elevation myocardial infarction (MI) < or = 24 hours, thrombolytic therapy < or = 7 days, hemodynamic instability\/shock, or renal insufficiency were excluded.\nRESULTS: Of the study cohort, 1340 patients (54%) received bivalirudin and 1164 patients (46%) received heparin plus GP IIb\/IIIa blockade. The incidence of inhospital mortality (0.3% vs 0.2%, P = .692), MI (6.6% vs 8.1%, P = .191), and combined end point of death, stroke, emergent coronary artery bypass graft\/PCI, and MI (6.9% vs 8.3%, P = .199) was similar in the bivalirudin and heparin plus GP IIb\/IIIa inhibitor groups.

The recent use of more potent immunosuppressive drug regimens has reduced the incidence of acute rejection, increasing the incidence of potentially fatal infectious complications, such as clinically important cytomegalovirus (CMV) infection. A 42-year-old kidney transplant recipient experienced on postoperative day 10 a dehiscence of the ureterovesical anastomosis, associated with a 7-cm longitudinal tear graft on the lower pole of the kidney and an ureteral ischemia. A graft biopsy demonstrated a mild acute rejection for which the patient received an unsuccessful administration of steroids, with progression of the rejection, so that 1 mg\/kg\/day antithymocyte globulin was administered. Two days later the patient presented with fever (39.5 degrees C), diffuse abdominal pain with tenderness and bloody diarrhea, and diagnosis of CMV colitis was achieved; rectal samples were taken for histologic examination, and Clostridium difficile toxin was isolated. A subtotal colectomy with Hartmann's procedure was performed, but the patient died 13 days later of a multiple organ failure. The risk of lethal CMV colitis is increased in patients being treated with anti-rejection therapy for severe acute rejection; the occurrence of simultaneous infection, such as pseudomembranous colitis, usually characterized by a favorable prognosis, increases the mortality rate in these patients.",

        "Abstract":"In the case of an emergency coronary procedure where the risk of contrast-induced nephropathy is especially high, there are few reliable methods to attenuate renal injury. We examined the efficacy of sodium bicarbonate for the prevention of contrast-induced nephropathy in patients undergoing an emergency coronary procedure. We enrolled 59 patients who were scheduled to undergo an emergency coronary angiography or intervention. These patients were randomized to receive a 154-mEq\/L infusion of sodium bicarbonate (n = 30) or sodium chloride (n = 29), as a bolus of 3 ml\/kg\/hour for 1 hour before the administration of contrast, followed by an infusion of 1 ml\/kg\/hour for 6 hours during and after the procedure. In the sodium bicarbonate group, serum creatinine concentration remained unchanged within 2 days of contrast administration (1.31 +\/- 0.52 to 1.31 +\/- 0.59 mg\/dl), whereas it increased in the sodium chloride group (1.32 +\/- 0.65 to 1.52 +\/- 0.92 mg\/dl, p = 0.01). The incidence of contrast-induced nephropathy (an increase >0.5 mg\/dl or >25% in serum creatinine concentration within 2 days of contrast) was significantly lower in the sodium bicarbonate group than in the sodium chloride group (7% vs 35%, p = 0.01, risk ratio 0.19, 95% confidence interval 0.046 to 0.80). In conclusion, hydration with sodium bicarbonate is more effective than with sodium chloride for the prevention of contrast-induced nephropathy in patients undergoing an emergency coronary procedure.",

Each group was further randomly divided into two subgroups: hydration and nonhydration. All patients in abnormal group took twice orally loading dose of 1200 mg acetylcysteine (ATLS) at 12 h before scheduled time for coronary angiogram and immediately after procedure. Creatinine concentration was remeasured at the time of admission (just before catheterization), every day for the following three days.

Biopsy proven rejection was low in both groups and not significantly different (at one yr post-transplant 11% in the RDP group vs. 12% in control, p = 0.53). Based on protocol biopsy data, histologic recurrence of hepatitis C was demonstrated in 56% of the control group hepatitis C positive recipients vs. 39% in the RDP group (p = 0.05). There was a significantly lower incidence of post-transplant diabetes (PTDM) in the RDP vs. control group (at 6 months post-transplant 12% vs. 32%, p = 0.004).\nCONCLUSIONS: Rapid discontinuation of prednisone in liver transplant recipients is not associated with an increased risk of rejection, and may be associated with lower morbidity, especially PTDM and hepatitis C recurrence.",

The first, small (n = 74) prospective, single-blinded randomized study comparing MP and Cold Storage (CS) showed that the incidence of delayed graft function was higher after CS. There have been no reports in the literature on the effect of storage modality on long-term function of renal allografts. This paper presents an analysis of long-term results of renal transplantation in 415 patients operated on between 1994 and 1999. Of those, 227 kidneys were MP-stored prior to KTx. The control group consisted of 188 CS kidney transplants. Kidneys were not randomized to MP or to CS. Donor demographics, medical and biochemical data, cold ischemia time, HLA match and recipient data were collected. Standard triple-drug immunosuppression was administered to both groups. Mortality, graft survival and incidence of return to hemodialysis treatment were analyzed. Despite longer cold ischemia time and poorer donor hemodynamics in MP group, 5-year Kaplan-Meier graft survival was better in MP-stored than in CS-stored kidneys (68.2% vs. 54.2%, p = 0.02).\nCONCLUSION: In this nonrandomized analysis, kidney storage by MP improved graft survival and reduced the number of patients who returned to dialysis.",

Studies confirming its efficacy in this set of patients are scarce.\nOBJECTIVE: To assess the results of interventional treatment of coronary artery disease in patients undergoing dialysis.\nMETHODS: A total of 34 dialysis patients submitted to coronary angiography between September 1995 and October 2004 were divided according to presence or absence of coronary lesion, type of treatment and presence or absence of diabetes mellitus. The groups were compared according to their clinical and survival characteristics. Survival of patients undergoing interventional treatment was compared to overall survival of 146 dialysis patients at the institution in the same period. Interventional treatment was indicated to the same clinical conditions in the general population.\nRESULTS: Thirteen patients with no angiography coronary lesions presented a survival rate of 100% in 48 months as compared to 35% of 21 patients with coronary artery disease. Diabetic patients had a lower survival rate compared with non-diabetics. Angioplasty had a worse prognosis compared to surgery; however, 80% of patients undergoing angioplasty were diabetic. Seventeen patients submitted to interventional procedures presented a survival rate similar to that of the others 146 hemodialysis patients without clinical evidence of coronary disease.\nCONCLUSION: This small series shows that myocardial revascularization, whenever indicated, can be performed in dialysis patients.

We assessed the cumulative incidence of major adverse cardiac events (death, acute myocardial infarction, and target-vessel revascularization) and angiographic stent thrombosis during 2-year follow-up. A propensity score analysis to adjust for different baseline clinical, angiographic, and procedural characteristics was performed. The 2-year unadjusted cumulative incidence of major adverse cardiac events was 17.8% in the DES group and 21.0% in the BMS group (P=0.003 by log-rank test). Angiographic stent thrombosis was 1.0% in the DES group and 0.6% in the BMS group (P=0.09). After adjustment, the 2-year cumulative incidence of death was 6.8% in the DES group and 7.4% in the BMS group (P=0.35), whereas the rates were 5.3% in DES and 5.8% in BMS for acute myocardial infarction (P=0.46), 9.1% in DES and 12.9% in BMS for target-vessel revascularization (P<0.00001), and 16.9% in DES and 21.8% in BMS for major adverse cardiac events (P<0.0001).

Serum creatinine (SCr) levels and estimated glomerular filtration rate were assessed at baseline and 2 to 5 days after receiving medications. The primary outcome was a postdose SCr increase > or = 0.5 mg\/dL (44.2 micromol\/L) over baseline. Secondary outcomes were a postdose SCr increase > or = 25%, a postdose estimated glomerular filtration rate decrease of > or = 25%, and the mean peak change in SCr. In 414 patients, contrast volume, presence of diabetes mellitus, use of N-acetylcysteine, mean baseline SCr, and estimated glomerular filtration rate were comparable in the 2 groups.

A recent cohort evaluation found elevated risks of renal, cardiovascular, and cerebrovascular events when aprotinin was used. We sought to determine the impact of aprotinin on safety variables among patients receiving cardiothoracic surgery with cardiopulmonary bypass from a single US hospital that reserves aprotinin for complex surgeries and Jehovah's Witnesses and does not utilize celite-based activated clotting time determinations.\nMETHODS: We performed a cohort evaluation with multivariate logistic regression, including propensity score adjustment comprising patients from January 1, 2000 and December 31, 2005. We evaluated 3348 patients having cardiothoracic surgery in a single tertiary care medical center. We observed aprotinin use or lack of aprotinin in cardiothoracic surgery. The main outcome measures were odds (expressed as an odds ratio with 95% confidence interval) of developing myocardial infarction, cerebrovascular events, and renal dysfunction after cardiothoracic surgery between groups.\nRESULTS: Patients receiving aprotinin were less likely to experience a cerebrovascular event compared with control [0.65 (0.46-0.91)] and did not have an elevated odds of myocardial infarction [1.04 (0.53-2.04)] but were more likely to experience postoperative renal dysfunction [2.03 (1.37-3.01)].\nCONCLUSIONS: Aprotinin was not associated with negative myocardial or cerebrovascular risks but did increase the risk of renal dysfunction.

Adherence to ACC\/AHA guidelines for non-ST-segment elevation ACS has improved over time but further improvement is needed. Failure to reduce the dose of a GP IIb\/IIIa for patients with renal insufficiency resulting in excessive dosing of GP IIb\/IIIa inhibitors increases the risk of major bleeding and is particularly common among the elderly, women, and patients with renal insufficiency. The ACUITY study suggests that bivalirudin plus a GP IIb\/IIIa inhibitor is a suitable alternative to standard therapy for moderate- to high-risk patients with non-ST-segment elevation ACS who are undergoing early invasive intervention, and bivalirudin alone may be preferred because of a lower risk of major bleeding. However, interpretation of the ACUITY results is complicated by numerous methodologic concerns, so the role of bivalirudin in managing non-ST-segment elevation ACS is still evolving. In patients with ST-segment elevation, clopidogrel provides an early benefit in reopening occluded coronary arteries and a late benefit in reducing cardiovascular mortality and morbidity without increasing the risk of bleeding. Clopidogrel treatment is warranted before as well as after percutaneous coronary intervention in patients with ST-segment elevation MI who receive fibrinolytic therapy. Adding clopidogrel to fibrinolytic therapy and other standard therapy reduces mortality without increasing the risk of bleeding.\nCONCLUSION: Evidence-based guidelines provide recommendations for the management of ACS, but the pace of clinical research is rapid and current guidelines do not reflect the latest research findings. Pharmacists need to stay abreast of new developments and ensure that clinical practice reflects these developments.",

Furthermore, atherosclerotic RAS leads to deterioration of primary hypertension, progression of atherosclerosis manifestation such as occlusive and aneurysmatic peripheral artery disease, and chronic or acute organ damage such as left ventricular hypertrophy and recurrent flash pulmonary edema. Despite the lack of sufficiently powered randomized controlled trials, each hemodynamically relevant RAS (eg, > or = 70%) should be considered for stent angioplasty in patients without end-stage ischemic nephropathy or limited life expectancy due to concomitant disease (eg, cancer).

Sixteen patients (37%) presented LMs. Eleven patients (25%) presented occlusion at the time of PC diagnosis. Ascites was present in 12 patients (28%). Seventy-seven percent of the patients were Gilly 3 (diffuse nodules, 5-20 mm) and Gilly 4 (diffuse nodules>20 mm). The main endpoints were morbidity, mortality, completeness of cancer resection (CCR), and actuarial survival rates.\nRESULTS: The CS was considered as CCR-0 (no residual nodules) or CCR-1 (residual nodules <5 mm) in 30 patients (70%). Iterative procedures were performed in 26% of patients. Three patients had prior to CS + HIPEC, 10 had concomitant minor liver resection, and 3 had differed liver resections (2 right hepatectomies) 2 months after CS + HIPEC. The mortality rate was 2.3% (1 patient). Seventeen patients (39%) presented one or multiple complications (per procedure morbidity = 31%). Complications included deep abscess (n = 6), wound infection (n = 5), pleural effusion (n = 5), digestive fistula (n = 4), delayed gastric emptying syndrome (n = 4), and renal failure (n = 3). Two patients (3.6%) were reoperated. The median survival was 38.4 months (CI, 32.8-43.9). Actuarial 2- and 4-year survival rates were 72% and 44%, respectively. The survival rates were not significantly different between patients who had CS + HIPEC for PC alone (including the primary resection) versus those who had associated LMs resection (median survival, 35.3 versus 36.0 months, P = 0.73).\nCONCLUSION: Iterative CS + HIPEC is an effective treatment in PC from colorectal cancer. The presence of resectable LMs associated with PC does not contraindicate the prospect of an oncologic treatment in these patients.",

        "Abstract":"BACKGROUND: Patients receiving hemodialysis for end-stage renal disease (ESRD) are at high risk for death from ischemic heart disease (IHD). Nicorandil, a hybrid compound of adenosine triphosphate-sensitive potassium channel opener and nitric oxide donor, has been reported to improve the clinical prognosis of patients with IHD.\nOBJECTIVE: This study sought to investigate the efficacy of oral nicorandil in reducing the risks for cardiovascular events (CVEs) and CVE-related death in patients receiving hemodialysis for ESRD after undergoing percutaneous coronary intervention (PCI) for angina pectoris.\nMETHODS: For this retrospective chart review, we used data from telephone interviews and medical charts from 3 hospitals in Japan. Data from patients aged <80 years who were receiving hemodialysis for ESRD and who had undergone successful PCI for angina between January 1999 and December 2004 were included in the analysis. Patients were stratified based on status of nicorandil treatment before PCI, as follows: patients receiving nicorandil 5 mg PO TID (the recommended dosage in Japan) for >1 month before PCI (nicorandil group) or those who did not receive nicorandil (control group). We investigated 6-year follow-up data on the primary end point, defined as CVEs (ie, unplanned hospital admission for worsening anginal status, or CVE-related death). The secondary end point was CVE-related death. After the data were initially analyzed, we performed a propensity-matched analysis to minimize selection bias.\nRESULTS: Data from 356 patients were included in the study (235 men, 121 women; mean [SD] age, 69 [9] years; mean [SD] weight, 52.3 [9.1] kg; nicorandil group, 198 patients; control group, 158 patients). According to the estimated propensity scores, 107 patients from each group were matched. There were no differences between the 2 groups in the baseline characteristics. On propensity-matched patient analysis, the estimated rates of patients who were CVE-free at 6 years were 33.5% in the nicorandil group and 21.8% in the control group on Kaplan-Meier analysis (hazard ratio [HR] = 0.53; 95% CI, 0.36-0.78; P < 0.002), and the rates of 6-year survival (ie, patients who did not experience CVE-related death) were 92.7% in the nicorandil group and 85.8% in the control group (HR = 0.27; 95% CI, 0.07-0.89; P = 0.047). Cox multivariate analysis found that nico-randil treatment status was an independent predictor of CVEs (HR = 0.40; 95% CI, 0.18-0.91; P = 0.028) and CVE-related death (HR = 0.38; 95% CI, 0.14-0.78; P = 0.030).\nCONCLUSION: Results obtained in this retrospective study suggest the potential efficacy of nicorandil treatment in improving clinical outcomes in patients with IHD receiving hemodialysis following PCI.",

We analyzed delayed graft function frequency, acute rejection episodes (biopsy proven), renal function (creatinine at 1, 6, and 12 months), as well as graft and patient survivals. Categorical and continuous variables were evaluated as appropriate.\nRESULTS: We failed to observe a difference in the immunosuppressant drug protocol, cold ischemia time, or mean recipient or donor age. The prevalence of delayed graft function was 63% among the Belzer arm, and 50% among the Custodiol arm (P = NS). The renal function was the same in both arms at 1, 6, and 12 months. The graft survival after 3 months was 94% among the Belzer group (death from sepsis), and 95% among the Custodiol group (nonfunctioning graft). At 1 year, the results were 78% among the Belzer group (4 deaths from cardiovascular or infectious complications and 2 graft losses), and 79% among the Custodiol group (3 deaths, 1 primary nonfunctioning graft, and 1 graft loss; P = NS). After 12 months follow-up, patient survival was 84% among the Belzer group, and 86% among the Custodiol group. In the first year, the incidences of biopsy-proven acute rejection episodes were 37% among the Belzer group, and 33% among the Custodiol group.\nCONCLUSION: Custodiol solution achieved similar results compared with Belzer solution.",

Postoperative renal function, hemodynamics, and drug use (primary end points) were assessed in patients who underwent CABG using CPB; mortality and safety (secondary end points) were assessed in all patients who received the study drug.\nRESULTS: Of 303 randomized patients, 279 received the study drug and 272 underwent CABG using CPB. Compared with placebo, nesiritide was associated with a significantly attenuated peak increase in serum creatinine (0.15 +\/- 0.29 mg\/dl vs. 0.34 +\/- 0.48 mg\/dl; p < 0.001) and a smaller fall in glomerular filtration rate (-10.8 +\/- 19.3 ml\/min\/1.73 m(2) vs. -17.2 +\/- 21.9 ml\/min\/1.73 m(2); p = 0.001) during hospital stay or by study day 14, and a greater urine output (2,926 +\/- 1,179 ml vs. 2,350 +\/- 1,066 ml; p < 0.001) during the initial 24 h after surgery. In addition, nesiritide-treated patients had a shorter hospital stay (p = 0.043) and lower 180-day mortality (p = 0.046).\nCONCLUSIONS: Nesiritide in the setting of CABG with CPB is associated with improved postoperative renal function and possibly enhanced survival.

Primary end-point was 2-year all-cause mortality; secondary endpoints were perioperative myocardial ischemia and 2-year cardiac mortality.\nRESULTS: Of 173 patients, DM was diagnosed in 42 (24%) based on pre-existing treatment with OH (15%) or insulin (9%). During follow-up, 40\/173 (23%) patients died. All-cause mortality was similar in the non-diabetic (20%) and insulin groups (19%) but significantly higher in the OH group (42%; p = 0.025). Cardiac mortality tended to be higher in the OH group compared with the insulin and non-diabetic groups (27 vs. 19% and 11%, respectively; p = 0.066). Multivariate analysis revealed renal failure (odds ratio [OR] = 4.9, 95% confidence interval [CI] = 1.8-13.0), treatment with OH (OR = 3.3, 95% CI = 1.2-9.0), peripheral vascular surgery (OR = 2.7, 95% CI = 1.2-6.0), and prior diuretic therapy (OR = 2.6, 95% CI = 1.1-5.7) being independently associated with 2-year all-cause death. No difference existed in postoperative ischemia among the different groups.\nCONCLUSIONS: Long-term mortality after major non-cardiac surgery is elevated in patients with CAD and diabetes mellitus only if they are treated with OH, but not if they are treated with insulin.

An open surgical control cohort of 94 patients was identified by enrolling historical and concurrent subjects. Patients were assessed before treatment, at treatment, and at hospital discharge and returned for follow-up visits at 1 month, 6 months, and annually thereafter.\nRESULTS: One hundred thirty-seven of 140 patients had successful implantation of the endograft. Perioperative mortality in the endograft versus open surgical control cohort was 2.1% (n = 3) versus 11.7% (n = 11, P < .001). Thirty-day analysis revealed a statistically significant lower incidence of the following complications in the endovascular cohort versus the surgical cohort: spinal cord ischemia (3% vs 14%), respiratory failure (4% vs 20%), and renal insufficiency (1% vs 13%). The endovascular group had a higher incidence of peripheral vascular complications (14% vs 4%). The mean lengths of intensive care unit stay (2.6 +\/- 14.6 vs 5.2 +\/- 7.2 days) and hospital stay (7.4 +\/- 17.7 vs 14.4 +\/- 12.8 days) were significantly shorter in the endovascular cohort. At 1 and 2 years' follow-up, the incidence of endoleaks was 6% and 9%, respectively. Through 2 years of follow-up, there were 3 reinterventions in the endograft cohort and none in the open surgical control cohort. Kaplan-Meier analysis revealed no difference in overall mortality at 2 years.\nCONCLUSIONS: In this multicenter study early outcomes with descending aortic endovascular stent grafting were very encouraging when compared with those of a well-matched surgical cohort. However, at 2 years' follow-up, there is an incidence of endoleaks and reinterventions associated with endovascular versus open surgical repair. Continued vigilant surveillance of patients treated with an endograft is important.",

The lipid A antagonist eritoran (or E5564) prevents endotoxin-induced systemic inflammation in animals and humans. In this study we assessed the safety of eritoran administration in patients undergoing cardiac surgery and obtained preliminary efficacy data for the prophylaxis of endotoxin-mediated surgical complications.\nMETHODS: A double-blind, randomized, ascending-dose, placebo-controlled study was conducted at nine hospitals. Patients undergoing coronary artery bypass graft and\/or cardiac valvular surgery with cardiopulmonary bypass were enrolled. Patients received a 4-h infusion of placebo (n = 78) vs 2 mg (n = 24), 12 mg (n = 26), or 28 mg (n = 24) of eritoran initiated approximately 1 h before cardiopulmonary bypass.\nRESULTS: No significant safety concerns were identified with continuous safety monitoring, and enrollment continued to the highest prespecified dose (28 mg). No statistically significant differences were observed in most variables related to systemic inflammation or organ dysfunction\/injury.\nCONCLUSIONS: This Phase II safety study suggests that the administration of the novel lipid A antagonist, eritoran, is not associated with overt toxicity in cardiac surgical patients.

Hyperglycemic patients (glucose >6.05 mmol\/l) were treated with IV insulin in the intensive care unit (ICU) followed by SC insulin (outside ICU). Subgroup analysis was performed on 159 coronary artery bypass grafting (CABG)-only patients.\nRESULTS: Among all CT surgeries, patients with a preoperative diagnosis of diabetes had higher rates of postoperative mortality (7.3 vs. 3.3%; P = 0.03) and pulmonary complications (19.5 vs. 11.6%; P = 0.02) but had similar rates of infections and cardiac, renal, and neurological complications on univariate analysis. However, on multivariate analysis, a preoperative diagnosis of diabetes was not a significant factor in postoperative mortality or pulmonary complications. In CABG-only patients, no significant differences were seen in outcomes between diabetic and nondiabetic patients. Independent of diabetic status, glucose > or =11 mmol\/l on ICU admission was predictive of higher rates of mortality and renal, pulmonary, and cardiac postoperative complications.\nCONCLUSIONS: A combination of IV insulin (in the ICU) and SC insulin (outside the ICU), a less costly and less nursing-intensive therapy than 3 days of IV insulin postoperatively, results in a reduction of the increased surgical morbidity and mortality in diabetic patients after CT surgery.",

The impact of drug-eluting stent use on outcomes in such patients is unclear.\nOBJECTIVE: To compare the clinical outcomes of dialysis patients undergoing coronary stenting with versus without the use of drug-eluting stents.\nMETHODS: Baseline features and outcomes were compared in dialysis patients undergoing coronary stent implantation using either bare-metal devices only (n = 41) or drug-eluting stents (n = 33), in recruitment waves 3 (2001-2002; n = 2,047) and 4 (2004; n = 2,112) of the National Heart Lung, and Blood Institute Dynamic Registry. The primary study endpoint was the composite of major adverse cardiac events (MACE), defined as death, myocardial infarction (MI) or any repeat revascularization procedure at 1-year follow up.\nRESULTS: Baseline and procedural features and in-hospital MACE rates were similar in both groups.

Registry data were collected and compared for STEMI patients undergoing PCI and receiving eptifibatide or abciximab over a 3.5-year period. Six-month follow-up, using telephone interviews, included major adverse cardiac events and functional status.\nRESULTS: Baseline characteristics were similar for patients receiving eptifibatide (n = 294) or abciximab (n = 158). No significant differences in hospital clinical outcomes were observed for reinfarction (2 vs. 3% for eptifibatide and abciximab, respectively), repeat revascularization (3 vs. 4%), bleeding complications (8 vs. 12%), congestive heart failure (5 vs. 3%), cerebrovascular accidents (0 vs. 2%), renal failure (2 vs. 3%), and all-cause mortality at discharge (5 vs. 4%).

        "Abstract":"THE AIM OF THE STUDY: An estimation of influence of different doses of aprotynin on bleeding, coagulation parameters and safety of its use after coronary artery bypass grafting (CABG) in pts without coagulation disorders.\nMATERIAL AND METHODS: 91 patients underwent CABG, 73 men, 18 women in age 37 to 76 +\/- 56.5 years. Patients were randomly assigned to 3 groups; Group I; 38 pts. 6.5 mln KIU aprotynin. Group II; placebo--30 pts. Group III; 23 pts. 2 mln. KIU. There were 4 measurements 1.--before operation, 2. after discontinuing CPB, 3.--6 h after operation, 4.--24 h after operation. We measured Hb, Ht, PLT Glucose, D-dimers, APTT, TT Fibrynogen, INR, AT3, Ca2+, factor V, VIII, GOT GPT CK, CK-MB, CRP, ACT concentration of Hb in drainage 6 h after operation. There were estimated: renal function profile, drainage loss, perioperative MI, mortality, reoperation rate due to bleeding.\nRESULTS: The level of blood count and coagulation parameters did not differ between the groups in any test periods. D-dimer levels were significantly higher in the placebo group than in group I and III. The decrease of fibrin degradation was not related to the dose of aprotynin. Drainage was insignificantly higher in placebo group. Renal function was impaired in neither group. Reoperation rate perioperative infarction and mortality did not differ between the groups, however was highest in group I.\nCONCLUSION: Aprotynin reduces blood loss after operation in CPB and decrease fibrin degradation independently to the dose of the drug. The high-dose of aprotynin may increase the risk of early graft occlusion in patients without coagulation disorders.",

        "Abstract":"Cardiovascular disease is the main cause of death after renal transplantation. There are few trials evaluating the efficacy of prevention strategies in renal transplant patients on major adverse cardiac events (MACE) and cardiovascular mortality. However, there is general agreement that active prevention strategies can significantly decrease cardiovascular mortality after renal transplantation. Here, we present the case of a 52-year-old male patient who received a first kidney transplant in 1993. He showed a small fixed perfusion defect on thallium scintigraphy before transplant. He was admitted at 13 months due to an antero-lateral myocardial infarction that was complicated with ventricular fibrillation. Despite anti-coagulation with acenocumarol, treatment with statins and angiotensin II receptor blocking agents and an excellent preservation of renal function, the patient presented with a second episode of myocardial infarction at 9 years post-transplant. This case report is discussed in order to highlight the way in which attitudes have been modified in the past decade in order to systematically pursue an early diagnosis of pre-existing coronary artery disease, aggressively treat MACE and actively decrease cardiovascular risk in transplant patients, using all available efficacious treatments as well as individualizing immunosuppression to prolong not only graft but also patient survival.",

        "Abstract":"BACKGROUND: The purpose of the study was to evaluate the efficacy and safety of a bone-targeted regimen consisting of zoledronate, thalidomide, and interferon-gamma in patients with renal cell carcinoma and bone metastases.\nMETHODS: Eligible patients had radiographic evidence of bone metastasis. Impending pathologic fractures or spinal cord compressions must have been controlled by surgery or radiation therapy before enrollment. Zoledronate (4 mg) was given intravenously every 4 weeks, thalidomide (300 mg) was given orally once a day, and interferon-gamma (100 microg) was given subcutaneously once a week. Patients were evaluated for time to skeletal-related events, the appearance of calcification in osteolytic metastases, and levels of the bone formation\/resorption markers. RESULTS.: Fifteen patients were treated between November 2002 and November 2003; 12 had previously undergone surgery, radiation, or embolization for their bone metastases; 11 had more than 3 sites of bone involvement; and 9 also had nonosseous metastases in the lung, liver, lymph node, pancreas, or adrenal gland. The median time to progression was 8.3 weeks (range, 2.1-48 weeks). The median time to a skeletal-related event was 12.0 weeks (range, 3.9-46.4 weeks). Two patients discontinued treatment because of adverse drug reactions (1 deep venous thrombosis and 1 myocardial infarction). Two patients experienced pain improvement and developed calcification in osseous metastases; these patients also showed favorable changes in bone marker levels.\nCONCLUSIONS: In this pilot study a bone-targeted regimen combining zoledronate, thalidomide, and interferon-gamma was well tolerated and might provide clinical benefit for a small subset of patients with renal cell carcinoma and bone metastases.",

Increased age was the only independent correlate of bleeding events. Among patients with reduced creatinine clearance (CrCl), lack of adjustment of the maintenance infusion for CrCl < or =50 ml\/min occurred frequently (15 of 33 patients, or 45%) and was associated with a high rate of bleeding (20%). The association of CrCl with bleeding appeared to be largely mediated by the incorporation of age in the estimation of CrCl. Patient gender, Cr, weight, and the peak activated clotting time were not associated with bleeding.\nCONCLUSIONS: Among NSTEACS PCI patients treated with eptifibatide, increased age was a significant correlate of bleeding events and appeared to explain the association between low CrCl and bleeding. The more widespread use of CrCl or other estimates of renal function over Cr may lead to more appropriate dose adjustments of eptifibatide.",

Periprocedural events, 1- and 6-month clinical outcomes were compared between octogenarians (n = 339) and patients <80 years of age (n = 2,827).\nRESULTS: Baseline characteristics revealed a higher prevalence of females (P < 0.001), Caucasians (P = 0.004), chronic renal failure (P < 0.001), heart failure (P < 0.001), number of diseased vessels (P = 0.009), and lower ejection fraction (P = 0.03) in octogenarians. Patients <80 years showed more positive family history (P < 0.001), hyperlipidemia (P = 0.006), smoking (P < 0.001), and obesity (P < 0.001). Clinical presentation and procedural success were similar in both groups as were death, myocardial infarction (MI), and repeat revascularization in-hospital. At 6 months, restenosis rates were low and comparable. In the subgroup of octogenarians who presented with acute coronary syndrome, mortality (15% vs. 3%, P < 0.001) and Q-wave MI occurred more often. Multivariate analysis revealed age >80 (P = 0.008), cardiogenic shock (P < 0.001), Q-wave MI at presentation (P = 0.003), and length of hospital stay (P = 0.003) to be independent predictors of mortality.\nCONCLUSIONS: PCI with DES in octogenarians results in a similar reduction of restenosis rates when compared to patients <80 years. Yet in octogenarians who presented with acute coronary syndrome, incidence of mortality and Q-wave MI at 6 months was higher as compared to younger patients.",

Donor type, histocompatibility, cold ischemia time and prior delayed graft function were similar between the two groups. Demographics and pharmacological data were recorded for all subjects.\nRESULTS: The results demonstrated that CsA caused a greater number of oral diseases. A greater number of gingival overgrowth was present in patients treated with CsA. However, the combined use with calcium channel blockers increased the gingival overgrowth number. The occurrence of candida in saliva was observed in 80 renal recipients treated with CsA and 20 treated with FK-506. The presence of squamous oral carcinoma (n = 3) and herpes simplex (n = 10) was observed in patients treated with CsA. These alterations were not observed in renal recipients treated with FK-506.\nCONCLUSIONS: Renal recipients constitute a high-risk group for oral diseases, as they are immunocompromised. However, the FK-506 regime appears to ameliorate this effect, compared with CsA. Adequate pre- and post-transplant oral health care is recommended for these subjects, irrespective of the time interval for which the drug is administered.",

In addition, the nature of pharmacological interventions that would benefit the patients before or after procedures such as coronary bypass graft (CABG) and percutaneous coronary intervention (PCI) has not been fully investigated.\nMETHODS: In the trial 500 patients with renal insufficiency (defined as a glomerular filtration rate (GFR) of between 89 and 30 ml . min(-1) . (1.73 m(-2)) following CAG will be randomly assigned to receive either valsartan, an angiotensin receptor blocker or angiotensin converting enzyme (ACE) inhibitor plus valsartan.1 The primary end-point is a change in the GFR of patients, which will be followed up for 3 years, including following CABG surgery or PCI. The incidence of cardiac events as well as the adverse effects of pharmacological intervention will be evaluated. In addition, the incidence of renal artery stenosis at the time of CAG will be reported also; however, the patients with renal artery stenosis will be excluded from the present study.\nCONCLUSION: The present study will provide data on: 1) the exact incidence and course of renal function of CIN after CAG; and 2) the comparative therapeutic benefit of pharmacological intervention with valsartan alone or with valsartan and an ACE inhibitor in combination in patients with coexisting coronary artery diseases and chronic renal insufficiency, regardless of whether they receive CABG or PCI.

        "Abstract":"A 56-year-old man with heparin-induced thrombocytopenia with thrombosis syndrome (HITTS) received anticoagulation with recombinant hirudin (lepirudin) for emergency coronary artery bypass graft (CABG) surgery and aortic valve replacement. The patient experienced life-threatening refractory bleeding that was successfully treated with recombinant factor VIIa. He had a history of infective endocarditis that resulted in severe aortic insufficiency, three-vessel coronary artery disease, and acute renal failure requiring hemodialysis. The patient was transferred from another hospital for the emergency surgery, but before his transfer, he developed HITTS secondary to therapeutic heparin for a deep vein thrombosis of the lower extremity. The presence of HITTS, the urgent nature of the case, and the availability of the direct thrombin inhibitor led the surgical team to select lepirudin for anticoagulation to facilitate cardiopulmonary bypass. After separation from cardiopulmonary bypass, the patient was in a coagulopathic state due to the inability to reverse the lepirudin and the slowed elimination of the drug secondary to inadequate renal function. As a result, the patient experienced excessive generalized oozing that was unresponsive to traditional therapies and blood product transfusions. Recombinant factor VIIa 35 microg\/kg was given as rescue therapy. The bleeding slowed, which allowed placement of chest tubes and closing of the sternum. The patient was transferred to the intensive care unit in stable condition with no evidence of thrombosis in the freshly placed bypass grafts or on the bioprosthetic valve.

Thrombin activatable fibrinolysis inhibitor (TAFI) is a glycoprotein that links coagulation and fibrinolysis. The purpose of this study was to assess TAFI concentrations in renal transplant recipients in relation to blood pressure. Additionally, we evaluated thrombin activity (thrombin-antithrombin complex [TAT], prothrombin fragments 1+2 [F1+2]), thrombomodulin (TM), and the degree of plasmin generation (plasmin-antiplasmin complex [PAP]) using commercially available kits. The studies were performed on 86 renal allograft recipients (48 women, 38 men) at age range 26 to 73 years. The immunosuppressive regimen consisted of cyclosporine (CsA), prednisone, and azathioprine (n = 58) or mycophenolate mofetil (MMF; n = 28). All patients maintained sufficient and stable graft function, showing no clinical signs of rejection. In patients with hypertension (n = 68), we observed significantly higher concentrations of TAFI and of markers of thrombin generation (F1+2, TAT), and of thrombomodulin with significantly prolonged euglobulin clot lysis time (ECLT), which reflects overall fibrinolytic activity and lower fibrinolytic activity index (FAI). Both groups did not differ with respect to age, creatinine clearance, body mass index, time after transplantation, albumin, fibrinogen, and PAP. Diastolic blood pressure correlated significantly with TAFI concentrations, uric acid, and prednisone dose, whereas systolic blood pressure correlated with urea, uric acid, creatinine clearance, and MCV. Elevated TAFI concentrations and enhanced thrombin generation in hypertensive kidney transplant recipients may contribute to the hypofibrinolysis and progressive atherosclerosis in this population.

A 74-year-old man was scheduled for elective abdominal aortic aneurysm resection. During the surgery, both femoral arteries were found non-pulsatile requiring thrombectomy. The next day, second laparotomy was needed because of superior mesenteric artery occlusion. After the surgery, acute renal failure and hypoxemia continued with progressive thrombocytopenia necessitating frequent administration of platelet concentrates. Considering possibility of HIT, we stopped heparin and began argatroban. Due to his mild liver dysfunction, we initiated argatroban at 0.5 microg x kg(-1) x min(-1) one-fourth of standard initial dose, according to its drug information approved by FDA. Although expected APTT level was from 50 to 60 sec, it increased immediately up to 93 sec. Excessive anticoagulation continued more than 24 hours after cessation of argatroban and bleeding occurred from the tracheostomy site. When APTT decreased to the target range, we restarted argatroban and found the adequate dosage at 0.08 microg x kg(-1) x min(-1). After argatroban treatment, platelet count recovered immediately and no thromboembolism was observed. We recommend that argatroban should be initiated at a lower dosage than the dose shown in its drug information for HIT patients after cardiovascular surgery with frequent monitoring of APTT.",

        "Abstract":"In postmenopausal women, hormone replacement therapy (HRT) does not substantially reduce the incidence of cardiovascular disease and may produce a short-term increase in risk. Therefore, we investigated whether HRT increased risk in patients with severe coronary artery disease necessitating surgery We prospectively studied 4,782 patients undergoing coronary artery bypass grafting at 70 centers in 17 countries from November 1996 through June 2000. Patients were selected using a systematic sampling technique. Mortality, major morbidity, and transfusion requirements were compared among 3 groups: men (n=3,840), women receiving HRT (n= 144), and women not receiving HRT (n=798). Women actively receiving HRT, compared with women not receiving HRT or with men, were at no greater risk of developing the following fatal or non-fatal complications: death (2.8% vs 4.4% vs 2.8%, respectively; P=0.05), myocardial infarction (6.3% vs 7.0% vs 7.7%; P=0.67), central nervous system complication (2.1% vs 2.8% vs 2.9%; P=0.85), or renal dysfunction (0.7% vs 5.3% vs 4.8%; P=0.06). Incidence of postoperative congestive heart failure was significantly lower in men (7.7%) than in women receiving HRT (12.5%; P=0.04) and in women without HRT (12.8%; P <0.0001). Fewer men (61%) needed red blood cell transfusion than did women receiving HRT (79%) and women without HRT (88%) (P <0.0001 compared with both other groups). However, the need for fresh frozen plasma transfusions was significantly less in women receiving HRT (16%) than in women not receiving HRT (25%; P=0.01). We conclude that HRT administration before coronary artery bypass grafting does not increase women's risk of any adverse outcome.",

        "Published":null,
        "Abstract":"OBJECTIVES: Although suprarenal fixation may be of benefit during endovascular aneurysm repair (EVAR), its safety with regards to renal effects remains uncertain. To date, there has been no controlled study of the topic, with most reports relying upon single-center experiences that use heterogeneous patient populations and devices from different manufacturers. The purpose of this analysis was to evaluate the effect of suprarenal fixation on renal function by comparing homogeneous patient populations receiving EVAR grafts from a single manufacturer that are identical in design and delivery method, except for utilizing either suprarenal (SR) or infrarenal (IR) fixation.\nMETHODS: During two pivotal US Food and Drug Administration trials, 283 patients underwent EVAR with the Powerlink bifurcated graft. The trials' inclusion and exclusion criteria and grafts were identical except for fixation scheme. Clinical, laboratory, and computed tomographic (CT) data were retrospectively reviewed. A comparison of preoperative, perioperative (1 to 7 days), and postoperative (>7 days) alterations in serum creatinine (SCr), creatinine clearance (CrCl), and blood pressure was performed. Renal adverse events were determined by CT scan and clinical chart review and included renal infarction, renal artery stenosis (either progressive or requiring renal stent placement), and renal artery occlusion.\nRESULTS: Both SR and IR groups demonstrated a significant increase in SCr and a decrease in CrCl over time. No significant difference in SCr or CrCl existed between groups during any time period. There were no differences in postoperative renal impairment (IR, 10.2%; SR, 7.6%, P = .634), the need for hemodialysis (IR, 0.7%; SR, 0%, P = 1.00), or systolic and diastolic blood pressure during subsequent follow-up between treatment groups. There was no significant difference in the number of renal adverse events detected by CT between the IR (10, 6.8%) and SR (3, 3.8%) groups (P = .550).\nCONCLUSION: Suprarenal fixation does not lead to a significant increase in acute renal events, renal impairment, or alteration in blood pressure compared with infrarenal fixation. Patients undergoing aneurysm repair with devices that use either suprarenal or infrarenal fixation develop progressive renal dysfunction over time. Further studies are needed to determine the long-term effects of suprarenal fixation on renal function and progression of renal artery stenosis.",

        "Abstract":"BACKGROUND: Basiliximab (Simulect) therapy reduces acute rejection episodes in renal transplantation. Posttransplant acute tubular necrosis (ATN) is a predisposing factor for acute rejection and reduced graft survival. Anti-lymphocyte antibodies have been used to delay the use of calcineurin antagonists in patients receiving cadaveric renal transplants and to prevent acute rejection episodes. The aim of our study was to learn about the effects of Simulect on ATN in high-risk cadaveric renal transplantation recipients.\nMATERIALS AND METHODS: We studied 93 patients including, 45 who received Simulect (20 mg before transplantation and 20 mg at day 4 posttransplant and 48 patients who did not receive Simulect. All patients received mycophenolate mofetil, steroids, and cyclosporine (46%) or tacrolimus (54%). We defined ATN as the need for dialysis during the first week after transplantation. Risk factors for ATN were: cold ischemia time, donor and recipient age, donor cause of death as stroke, HLA matching, and panel-reactive antibodies.\nRESULTS: Among 54 patients who experienced ATN, 44% were in the Simulect group and 71% in the other group (P = .01). In the regression analysis, Simulect was shown to be a protective factor: 0.19 (0.05 to 0.62). Presence of de novo diabetes was more frequent in the group that did not receive Simulect (16 [33%] vs 6 [13%]; P = .02). Acute rejection episodes were similar in both groups: 2.5% in the Simulect group versus 4% in the other group (P = .34). CMV infections occurred in 15 patients (33%) from the Simulect group and in 20 patients (42%) in the other group. Seven patients died in the Simulect group, and five patients died in the other group. In general, Simulect was well tolerated and the degree of complications was similar in both groups.\nCONCLUSION: Simulect reduced the incidence of ATN among patients receiving a high-risk renal graft. It was well tolerated and no adverse effects were observed. The use of Simulect should be considered for patients receiving renal grafts at high risk for ATN.",

This meta-analysis sought to determine whether adjunctive NSAIDs improve postoperative analgesia and reduce cumulative narcotic requirements.\nMETHODS: A comprehensive search was undertaken to identify all randomized trials, in cardiothoracic patients, of NSAIDs plus narcotics vs narcotics without NSAIDs. Medline, Cochrane Library, EMBASE, and abstract databases were searched up to September 2005. The primary outcome was visual analogue scale (VAS) pain score. Secondary outcomes included 24-hr cumulative morphine-equivalents, rescue medications required, mortality, myocardial infarction, atrial fibrillation, stroke, renal failure, hospital readmissions, and in-hospital costs.\nRESULTS: Twenty randomized trials involving 1,065 patients were included. A significant reduction in 24-hr VAS pain score was found in patients receiving NSAIDs [weighted mean difference (WMD) -0.91 points, 95% confidence interval (CI) -1.48 to -0.34 points]. In addition, patients required significantly less morphine-equivalents in the first 24 hr (WMD -7.67 mg, 95% CI -8.97 to -6.38 mg). No significant difference was found with respect to mortality [odds ratio (OR) 0.19, 95% CI 0.01 to 4.22], myocardial infarction (OR 0.71, 95% CI 0.09 to 5.71), renal dysfunction (OR 0.95, 95% CI 0.37 to 2.46), or gastrointestinal bleeding (OR 0.96, 95% CI 0.13 to 7.09).\nCONCLUSION: In patients less than 70 yr of age undergoing cardiothoracic surgery, the adjunctive use of NSAIDs with narcotic analgesia reduces 24-hr VAS pain score and narcotic requirements.",

Whether drug-eluting stents safely reduce restenosis and enhance event-free survival in these patients is unknown. We sought to evaluate the impact of baseline RI on clinical and angiographic outcomes in patients undergoing elective percutaneous coronary intervention using either bare metal or paclitaxel-eluting stents.\nMETHODS: In the TAXUS-IV trial, 1314 patients were randomized to either the polymer-based paclitaxel-eluting TAXUS stent or an identical-appearing bare metal stent. Outcomes were stratified on the basis of the presence of RI, defined as a baseline creatinine clearance < 60 cm3\/min calculated by the Cockcroft-Gault formula.\nRESULTS: Baseline RI was present in 223 (17.2%) patients, in whom the mean creatinine clearance was 49.6 +\/- 8.5 cm3\/min. Compared with bare metal stents, treatment with the TAXUS stent resulted in lower rates of 9-month angiographic restenosis rates in both patients with (2.1% vs 20.5%, P = .009) and without (9.2% vs 27.8%, P < .0001) baseline RI. Similarly, 1-year target lesion revascularization rates were reduced with the TAXUS stent in patients with (3.3% vs 12.2%, P = .01) and without (4.7% vs 15.8%, P < .0001) baseline RI. The occurrence of death, myocardial infarction, and stent thrombosis at 1 year were similar in both randomization groups, independent of renal function.\nCONCLUSIONS: The polymer-based paclitaxel-eluting TAXUS stent safely reduces clinical and angiographic restenosis in patients with preserved as well as moderate impairment of baseline renal function.",

        "Abstract":"BACKGROUND: The administration of radiographic contrast agents is an important cause of acute renal failure. We hypothesised that hypertension is an independent risk factor for the development of contrast nephropathy in patients undergoing percutaneous coronary intervention.\nMETHODS: 1383 consecutive patients scheduled for elective or emergency percutaneous coronary intervention were randomly assigned to receive isotonic or half-isotonic hydration. Contrast nephropathy was defined as a rise in serum creatinine of at least 44 micromol\/l (0.5 mg\/dl) within 48 h of the procedure. Hypertension was defined as self-reported history of treated or untreated diagnosed high blood pressure.\nRESULTS: The prevalence of hypertension was 63%. Patients with hypertension were significantly older, were more often female, smoked less and had a higher incidence of 3-vessel disease than patients without hypertension. The estimated glomerular filtration rate was slightly lower in hypertensive patients. There was no difference in preventive hydration regimen, type and quantity of contrast medium used, or quantity of intravenous fluids given. Contrast nephropathy developed in 17 of 874 hypertensive patients (2%) compared to 2 of 509 patients (0.4%) without hypertension (p = 0.016). When contrast nephropathy was defined as a 25% rise in baseline creatinine, the disease developed in 103 patients (12%) with and 36 patients (7%) without hypertension (p = 0.005). After adjustment for confounders, arterial hypertension remained an independent predictor of contrast nephropathy (odds ratio 4.6, 95% CI 1.0-20.5, p = 0.046).\nCONCLUSION: Hypertension is an independent risk factor for the development of contrast nephropathy.

This study evaluated the association of race and ethnicity with allograft outcomes in a French population of 952 Caucasian (Cauc) patients and 140 African European (AE) patients who underwent renal transplantation in our center between 1987 and 2003. Demographic characteristics were similar for the two cohorts other than cause of end-stage renal failure (more hypertension among AE and more polycystic kidney disease among Cauc) and cold ischemia time (significantly longer for AE). Immunosuppressive treatment was comparable between groups. There were no significant differences between AE and Cauc in the incidence of acute rejection (31% vs. 30%). At 5 years post-transplant, patient survival (93% vs. 92%), graft survival (83% in both groups) and graft function (creatinine clearance 48 mL\/min vs. 45 mL\/min) were also similar among the AE and Cauc patients. We demonstrate that ethnic origin does not affect outcome after renal transplantation in France. Therefore, differences observed in the United States cannot be only related to immunologic or pharmacologic factors. The results of renal transplantation in patients of African origin could be improved with universal immunosuppressive drug coverage.",

The PREVENT III study was a prospective, randomized, multicenter, phase 3 trial of edifoligide for the prevention of vein graft failure in patients with CLI. We examined the baseline characteristics, perioperative medical therapies, and 30-day incidence of major cardiovascular events in the PREVENT III cohort.\nMETHODS: Demographics, medical and surgical history, mode of presentation for the index limb, procedural details, and concomitant medications were reviewed for all patients enrolled in PREVENT III (N = 1,404). Major adverse cardiovascular events, including death, myocardial infarction, or cerebrovascular event (stroke or transient ischemic attack) were tabulated. Univariate and multivariate analyses were performed to discern factors that were associated with the utilization of medical therapies and with perioperative events.\nRESULTS: Demographics and comorbidities reflected a population with diffuse, advanced atherosclerosis. Perioperative mortality was 2.7%, and major morbidity included myocardial infarction in 4.7% and stroke\/transient ischemic attack in 1.4%. Among this population of CLI patients, 33% were not on antiplatelet therapy at study entry, and 24% were not receiving antithrombotics of any type. In addition, 54% of patients were not receiving lipid-lowering therapy, and 52% were not prescribed beta-blocker medications at study entry. On multivariate analysis, race was a significant determinant of antithrombotic utilization, with African-American patients less frequently treated both at baseline and discharge (adjusted odd ratios, 0.5 and 0.6, P < .0001). Antithrombotic and beta-blocker drug usage increased in the overall cohort from baseline (76% and 48%) to discharge (88% and 60%; P < .0001). Patients treated in a university hospital setting were more likely to be prescribed antiplatelet, lipid-lowering, and beta-blocker medications. Advanced age (>75 years), coronary artery disease (prior myocardial infarction or revascularization), and dialysis-dependent renal failure were associated with an increased 30-day risk of death, myocardial infarction, or stroke. Protective effects of beta-blocker and lipid-lowering medications were noted in these defined subgroups.\nCONCLUSIONS: A significant percentage of the population that undergoes surgical revascularization for CLI is not prescribed therapies of proven benefit in reducing cardiovascular events. Utilization of antithrombotics and beta-blockers increases during hospitalization for limb salvage surgery but that of lipid-lowering therapy does not. African-American patients appear to be at greater risk for undertreatment with antithrombotics, and the data suggest that patients undergoing leg bypass surgery in a university hospital setting receive more comprehensive medical treatment of atherosclerosis. Treatment guidelines for medical therapy are needed to standardize care and improve outcomes for patients with CLI.",

Vitamin K antagonists, including warfarin, have similar risk-benefit balances. (2) Subcutaneous melagatran and its oral metabolic precursor ximelagatran have recently been granted marketing authorisation in France for use as prophylaxis after hip or knee replacement surgery. Melagatran, unlike LMWH, is a specific thrombin inhibitor. (3) There are four randomised double-blind trials in more than 9000 patients comparing these agents with a LMWH (enoxaparin in three trials, dalteparin in one). Melagatran was given subcutaneously for one or two days before being replaced with ximelagatran (as soon as oral feeding was possible) for 6 to 9 days. These trials showed no advantage of melagatran-ximelagatran in terms of clinical endpoints such as symptomatic deep venous thrombosis, pulmonary embolism, and death from all causes. (4) Three randomised double-blind trials have compared ximelagatran with warfarin in more than 5000 patients. Treatment lasted 7 to 12 days. Ximelagatran was no better than warfarin when assessed using clinical endpoints. (5) In these trials melagatran-ximelagatran did not increase the risk of bleeding compared with LMWH or warfarin. (6) Melagatran-ximelagatran can cause an increase in serum transaminase activity, and is contraindicated if pretreatment serum transaminase activity is more than twice the upper limit of normal. (7) Trials versus warfarin showed a higher risk of myocardial infarction in patients taking ximelagatran (0.7% versus 0.16%). (8) There are few data on the patient subgroups most likely to receive melagatran-ximelagatran, namely patients over 75, underweight and overweight patients, and patients with renal failure. (9) There is currently no clotting test that allows the melagatran-ximelagatran dose regimen to be adjusted in patients who have an increased risk of adverse effects due to overdosing. There is no available antidote if overdose occurs. (10) Erythromycin increases melagatran bioavailability, thereby increasing the bleeding risk. Melagatran and ximelagatran must not be combined with other anticoagulants, thrombolytic agents or antiplatelet drugs because of a increased bleeding risk.

In this pilot study, we investigated the outcome of pediatric renal transplantation with an early steroid withdrawal protocol. This is a retrospective case-control study of pediatric renal transplants with age-matched historical control. Groups were comparable in terms of HLA matching, donor type and graft ischemia time. In the steroid withdrawal group (SWG, n = 13), induction therapy included mycophenolate mofetil (MMF) and a 5-day course of steroids with Thymoglobulin in 11 and basiliximab in two other patients. In the steroid group (SG, n = 13), in addition to steroids, four patients were given basiliximab, eight were given Thymoglobulin, and one OKT3. Maintenance therapy included tacrolimus (SWG n = 11, SG n = 3) or cyclosporine (SWG n = 2, SG n = 10). Azathioprine was given to all the patients in the SG, except the last two patients of this series who were prescribed MMF. MMF was given to all in the SWG. Patient and graft survival rates were 100% in both groups. In the SWG, no acute rejection episode was detected. In the steroid group, three patients (25%) presented with an acute rejection episode. All but one patient in either group showed immediate graft function.

We noted nonsignificant differences in postoperative interventions and complications, the need for RRT (0.7% vs 2.1%; P = .37), total (6.1% vs 9.6%; P = .26) and serious adverse events, hospital mortality (3.4% vs 2.7%; P>.99), and ICU and hospital length of stay between the N-acetylcysteine and placebo groups. A post hoc subgroup analysis of patients (baseline creatinine level >1.4 mg\/dL [120 micromol\/L]) showed a nonsignificant trend toward fewer patients experiencing postoperative renal dysfunction in the N-acetylcysteine group compared with the placebo group (25.0% vs 37.1%; P = .29).\nCONCLUSIONS: N-acetylcysteine did not prevent postoperative renal dysfunction, interventions, complications, or mortality in high-risk patients undergoing CABG surgery with CPB. Further research is required to identify CABG patients at risk for postoperative renal events, valid markers of renal dysfunction, and to establish renal thresholds associated with important clinical outcomes.",

The purpose of our study was to evaluate the clinical outcomes of patients sustaining AMI who underwent emergent percutaneous coronary intervention (PCI) and who were distinguished by the use of the anti-GP IIb\/IIIa agent eptifibatide. We studied a consecutive group of 216 patients who underwent PCI for acute ST-elevation myocardial infarction and compared the outcomes of patients who received eptifibatide just prior and following the procedure (n=167) to those who were not on anti GP IIb\/IIIa inhibitors (n=49). On average, patients treated using eptifibatide were younger and were more likely to be men, hypertensive, and smokers. The eptifibatide treated patients were less likely to have diabetes and renal failure and had worse angiographic characteristics. There were no significant differences between the groups in any of the clinical outcomes, including the composite endpoint (e.g. death, MI, repeat revascularization) and the rate of sub-acute stent thrombosis. Nonetheless, there was a non-significant trend towards lower 30 day mortality in the eptifibatide group (4.8% versus 12%, P=0.09). We concluded that in our comparative study of periprocedural administration of eptifibatide during emergent AMI angioplasty, there was a non-significant trend towards better short-term survival among eptifibatide treated patients although the composite endpoint did not differ between patients distinguished by the use of anti GP IIb\/IIIa small molecule pharmacotherapy.",

We sought to determine if cardiovascular medications were utilized less in patients with renal dysfunction following coronary artery bypass grafting (CABG) and if the association of decreased medication use was independent of comorbid conditions. We also examined associations between cardiovascular medication use and mortality at 6 months.\nMETHODS: Data from the National Veterans Adminstration (VA) Continuous Improvement in Cardiac Surgery Program were merged with the national VA pharmacy database. Prescription rates within 6 months of discharge for CABG were obtained for four classes of medicines: beta blockers, lipid-lowering agents, antiplatelet agents, and angiotensin antagonists. Utilization of medications in patients with estimated glomerular filtration rate (GFR) 60 to 90, 30 to 60, and <30 were compared with the reference group of GFR >90.\nRESULTS: In a retrospective analysis of 19,411 patients, the frequency of nonprescription increased with declining GFR. Decreased utilization for patients with GFR 30 to 60 and <30 remained highly significant after adjustment for age, race, hypertension, diabetes, and prior myocardial infarction. In patients with more advanced renal dysfunction (GFR <60), cardiovascular medication use for all medication classes was associated with survival at 6 months after adjusting for demographic and clinical variables. Cumulative protection was seen with use of medication from each additional class.\nCONCLUSION: In a large VA population undergoing CABG, renal disease is associated with highly significant decreases in utilization of cardiovascular medications. Nonprescription of medications was associated with adverse outcomes in those with renal dysfunction.",

The most effective preventive strategy is unknown.\nOBJECTIVES: This study sought to estimate the incidence of CIN in patients receiving comprehensive intravenous and oral volume supplementation for PCI during which iopromide (Ultravist 370, Schering, Berlin, Germany) was used.\nMETHODS: We prospectively studied the development of CIN in 425 consecutive patients undergoing PCI, applying comprehensive intravenous and oral hydration in all patients. Baseline renal function was assessed by calculating the glomerular filtration rate (GFR) with the use of the abbreviated Modification of Diet in Renal Disease Study equation. CIN was defined as an increase in serum creatinine of at least 0.5 mg\/dl (44 mmol\/l) within 48 hours.\nRESULTS: Mean patients' age (mean +\/- SD) was 64 +\/- 10 years. A total of 133\/425 patients (31%) were 70 years or older, 107 (25%) were women, 70 (16%) were diabetics, 218 (51%) had prior myocardial infarction, and 43 (10%) underwent PCI for an acute ST-segment elevation myocardial infarction. Mean GFR was 89 ml\/min\/1.73 m2. Glomerular filtration rate was below 60 ml\/min\/ 1.73 m2 in 43 patients (10%). During PCI 226 +\/- 80 ml of iopromide were used. With the comprehensive hydration strategy used, CIN developed in only 6 of 425 (1.4%; 95% confidence interval 0.5-3.1%) patients. No patient required dialysis.\nCONCLUSIONS: Applying the combination of intravenous and oral volume supplementation results in a very low incidence of CIN following PCI.

        "Abstract":"Essential thrombocythaemia (ET), the most often occurring myeloproliferative disorder is a clonal malignant disorder arising from stem cell. The course of the disease is complicated by some severe thrombotic events and far less commonly by haemorrhagic phenomena. Treatment of ET consist of antiplatelet drugs (e.g. aspirin) and lowering platelet count (hydroxyurea or interferon alpha). Anagrelide (anagrelide hydrochloride) is an imidazoquinazoline derivative which lowers platelet count probably by inhibiting thrombopoiesis and reduces platelet aggregation. The aim of the study was to evaluate the efficacy and side effects of anagrelide in patients with ET refractory to prior treatment with hydroxyurea. Anagrelide (Agrylin or Thromboreductin) was used in 40 patients with ET from Jan. 1999 to June. 2003. Out of 40 patients, there were 29 females and 11 males, (median age 52.0 +\/- 14.25 years; range, 21-72). Median follow up was 23 months (range, 8 to 54 months). Anagrelide in the average dose of 2,0 mg (range, 1,0-3,5 mg) reduced platelet count in all patients. Median time of response was 3-4 weeks. Complete remission (platelet count < or =450 G\/l) achieved 22 persons (55%) and partial remission 17 persons, and only one patient had platelet count slightly above 600 G\/l (627 G\/l). There was a significant (p < 0.05) reduction in platelet count from a mean of 1136.05 +\/- 295.09 G\/l to 480.98 +\/- 72.26 G\/l (56%) Despite platelet count reduction <500 G\/l in 3 patients reappeared symptoms of low extremities deep venous thrombosis and in one transient ischaemic cerebral stroke was found. Hemoglobin level in a single case was lower than 12 g\/dL (10.8 g\/dL), and neither leukopenia nor disturbances of hepatic or renal function were observed. During the first two months of treatment with anagrelide some mild and transient side effects were noticed, eg. headache in 10 (25%), fluid retention in 8 (20%), palpitations in 4 (10%), and diarrhoea in 2 (5%) patients, but all of them continued therapy. Achieved platelet count reduction allowed in 2 ET patients safe performance of planned surgery (cholecystectomy, partial thyroidectomy) and in 1 balloon coronary angioplasty. Anagrelide proved to be an effective drug for of ET patients refractory to hydroxyurea.",

However, chronic steroid therapy has been implicated as a risk factor for abdominal complications and mortality following surgery. We assessed the impact of chronic steroid therapy had on outcome following cardiac surgery.\nMETHODS: During the period January 1999 to March 2003 there were 98 patients on chronic steroid therapy (Group S) who underwent cardiac surgery at our institution. These patients were matched with a control group of 98 patients who were not on steroids (Group C). A propensity score was used to perform the matching. The C statistic for this model was 0.72.\nRESULTS: Ninety (93.7%) of the 98 patients in Group S had been on oral prednisolone for a median of 9.5 years (25th and 75th percentile of 5 and 12 years) with a median dose of 5mg (25th and 75th percentile of 4 and 8.75 mg). Preoperative characteristics were well matched between both groups. There was no difference in the post-operative outcome between the two groups with respect to mortality, stroke, renal failure, abdominal complications, wound infections, requirement for inotropic support and myocardial infarction. Patients in Group S were more likely to develop atrial arrhythmias and to require prolonged ventilation, although this did not reach statistical significance.\nCONCLUSIONS: Chronic steroid therapy was not associated with increased mortality or overall morbidity following cardiac surgery. However, patients on chronic steroids may be at greater risk of developing atrial arrhythmias or of requiring prolonged ventilation.",

Three patients were of Italian and one of Turkish descent; only one patient was a native Austrian. The onset of the disease was 2.0, 7.5, 7.8, 9.4 months, and 22 years posttransplant. Diagnosis of KS was based in all cases on histology. The heart recipient developed a tumor on the planta pedis; one renal recipient, on both legs. The liver and the two remaining renal recipients presented with disseminated disease. Treatment in all cases consisted of reduction in immunosuppression, together with surgery (n = 1), chemotherapy (n = 1), or irradiation (n = 2). Furthermore, immunosuppression was switched in two cases from Tacrolimus to Sirolimus. In the liver recipient a complete response was achieved; he died, however, due to noncompliance followed by graft failure. One renal recipient died without evidence of recurrent disease from myocardial infarction. The cardiac and two renal recipients are alive between 4 months and 17 years with well-functioning grafts and no evidence of recurrent disease.\nDISCUSSION: HHV8-associated lesions seem to be extremely rare in the Central European transplant population.

This study assessed whether DZB could safely replace calcineurin inhibitors in the immediate postoperative period and promote recovery from ischemic acute tubular necrosis. Patients were randomized into one of two groups: DZB induction and daily mycophenolate mofetil (MMF; 2 g) with steroids (20 mg prednisone) or standard triple therapy with tacrolimus, MMF, and prednisone. Patients in the DZB arm were converted to the control arm when either the serum creatinine dropped to <350 micromol\/L or there was biopsy evidence of acute rejection. Over 2 years, Leicester and Newcastle non-heart-beating donor (NHBD) centers recruited 51 patients. There was one patient death in the DZB arm, during the study period, after a nonfunctioning graft was removed. A total of two (8%) grafts in the DZB arm and three (11.5%) grafts in the control arm failed to function. The overall rate of immediate function improved from around 5% (pre-2001) to 28%. There were no significant differences in the incidence of acute rejection or graft function (GFR) at 3 months.

A logistic regression model determined the association of preoperative statin use with in-hospital mortality (IHM). Propensity score analysis was used to match two sub-groups of patients (GrpI, on statins, n=534; GrpII, not on statins, n=534) on factors known to affect outcomes.

Delayed graft function (DGF) predisposes to acute rejection and shortens graft survival. The aim of this study was to determine the effects of basiliximab in renal transplantation recipients at high risk for DGF.\nMETHODS: We studied 87 patients (mean age, 59 years), 42 of whom received basiliximab, 20 mg before transplantation and 20 mg on day 4. This cohort was compared with 45 patients without basiliximab. All received cyclosporine (51%) or tacrolimus (49%), mycophenolate mofetil, and steroids. DGF was defined as the requirement for dialysis within the first week after transplantation or failure to improve preexisting renal function. High-risk factors for DGF were cold ischemia time, recipient and donor age, non-heart-beating donor, HLA matching, and panel reactive antibody (PRA).\nRESULTS: The incidence of DGF was 18 (43%) in the basiliximab group versus 28 (62%) in the other patients (P = .07). When allografts from non-heart-beating donors were excluded, this incidence was 14 (38%) in the basiliximab group versus 28 (62%) in the other patients (P = .04). Regression analysis showed basiliximab to be a protective factor: 0.26 (range, 0.09-0.76). Basiliximab was well tolerated, and complications were similar in both groups.\nCONCLUSIONS: Basiliximab reduced the incidence of DGF in patients who received a high-risk allograft.

Secondary immunosuppression included mycophenolate match (MMF) (n = 13) or azathioprine (n = 9). We analyzed human leukocyte antigen, cold ischemia time, acute tubular necrosis, creatinine, cholesterol, triglycerides, glucose, blood pressure, acute rejection episodes, immunosuppression, infections, disease recurrences, as well as graft and patient survival.\nRESULTS: After a mean cold ischemia time of 22 +\/- 4 hours, nine patients displayed delayed graft function of an average duration 9 +\/- 4 days. At 36 +\/- 35 months nine grafts were lost: two due to acute rejection; five to chronic allograft nephropathy; and two to venous thrombosis. One patient died of hemorrhagic shock. There were five cytomegalovirus infections. Graft survival was dependent on the type of secondary immunosuppression, incidence of acute rejection episodes and occurrence of delayed graft function.\nCONCLUSIONS: We found no clinical recurrence of lupus nephritis after transplantation and a low incidence of complications, although there was a trend toward thrombosis.

Comparison was made to 53 LD recipients transplanted from July 1, 1998, to June 30, 2001 (Group 2) receiving BX, steroids and TAC, without SL. Recipients of deceased donor kidneys were excluded because of variability in kidney quality, ischemic time, and patient management.\nRESULTS: Demographics were similar between groups: African Americans, 25% to 35%; mean age 36 years; mean HLA mismatch 3.7. Wound problems and infection were minimal in both groups. Mean serum creatinine and cholesterol and systolic and diastolic blood pressure measured periodically up to 1 year were similar, as was the incidence of rejection. In 25% of patients, SL was discontinued.\nCONCLUSIONS: Gradual introduction of SL appears to be associated with minimal wound problems. With more aggressive reduction in TAC, better renal function, and better long-term graft survival may be attainable. We currently lower TAC levels to 5 ng\/mL by 3 months.",

        "Abstract":"The aim of this study was to evaluate the impact of sirolimus and cyclosporine (CsA) combined therapy on the incidence and duration of delayed graft function (DGF), and the impact of the latter on 1-year graft function. The study entailed 23 cadaveric renal recipients treated with sirolimus-CsA-prednisone regimen (sirolimus group). The reference group entailed 23 patients treated with CsA-azathioprine-prednisone. In the sirolimus group the frequency of DGF was 39% and was essentially the same as in reference group (34.8%). The duration of DGF was significantly longer in SRL group and lasted 21.2 +\/- 12.2 days versus 6.8 +\/- 2.5 in reference group (P = .004). Serum creatinine level decreased below 3.0 mg\/dL after 36 +\/- 22 days in sirolimus group versus 16.8 +\/- 6 days in reference group (P < .04). Cold ischemia was slightly longer and donors were older in DGF patients in both groups. Sirolimus dose during first month was higher in DGF patients (3.5 versus 2.6 mg), whereas level of CsA was lower (230 versus 310 ng\/mL). Biopsy-proven acute rejection (AR) occurred in most of DGF patients and during the DGF period. Serum creatinine level at the 12th month posttransplant was higher in DGF versus non-DGF patients (2.0 +\/- 0.5 versus 1.5 +\/- 0.4 mg\/dL). One-year patient and graft survival was 100% in sirolimus group and 100% and 95% in reference group. In conclusion, sirolimus significantly retards the recovery from posttransplant renal failure; however, it does not increase the incidence of DGF. Patients who suffered from posttransplant acute renal failure had worse renal function at 1 year after transplantation, independent of the treatment protocol.",

        "Abstract":"We aim to characterize the hemorrhagic complications and predictors of increased bleeding risk in a population of patients with high-risk acute coronary syndromes (ACS), enrolled in the PRISM-PLUS study. Patients treated with heparin plus tirofiban had more bleeding events compared to patients treated with heparin alone. No significant increase in major bleeding, thrombocytopenia, blood loss and blood products transfusions was observed among the patients who received the combination therapy. Several clinical variables were independently associated with increased risk of bleeding for both treatment groups: advanced age, lower body weight, female gender, decreased creatinine clearance (<30 ml\/min). Females, patients with impaired renal function, patients requiring percutaneous coronary intervention (PCI), especially prolonged PCI (>100 min duration) or coronary artery bypass surgery (CABG) were at risk for increased major bleeding complications. Increased blood loss was also found in females, patients with elevated diastolic blood pressure, PCI, duration of PCI>100 min or CABG. No incremental risk was detected with the addition of tirofiban to heparin in patients at risk for major bleeding or increased blood loss. We concluded that identification of patients with high-risk ACS, at risk for bleeding complications and blood loss can be done with specific clinical variables. Tirofiban added to heparin increased minor hemorrhagic complications. Although there was no significant increase in major bleeding, thrombocytopenia and blood transfusions with the combination of tirofiban plus heparin, the power to detect a statistically significant difference in these endpoints was limited by the small number of events.",

        "Published":null,
        "Abstract":"BACKGROUND: Although periprocedural drug therapy has been shown to improve the outcome of percutaneous coronary intervention (PCI), information regarding its use in daily clinical practice is limited.\nMETHODS: We conducted a national survey on periprocedural drug therapy across the spectrum of PCI practice in Italy. Seventy-nine centers (41% of the Italian interventional cath labs) with a fair distribution across the country volunteered to enroll consecutive patients undergoing PCI for any indication from September 15 to 29, 2003.\nRESULTS: Of the 1517 patients enrolled, 745 (49 %) had stable coronary disease and 772 (51%) acute coronary syndromes (ACS): 457 without and 315 with ST-segment elevation. Stenting was used in 89% of cases. N-acetylcysteine was used in 23% of the patients with preexisting renal dysfunction. Thienopyridine (63% clopidogrel) pretreatment was given in 49 % of the cases and, at logistic regression analysis, was independently associated with prior myocardial infarction (p < 0.001), prior PCI (p = 0.007), stable coronary disease (p = 0.005), and treatment in northern Italy (p < 0.05). Platelet glycoprotein (GP) IIb\/IIIa receptor blockers (50% abciximab 50% tirofiban) were used in 22% of the stable patients and 40 % of those with ACS, a proportion increasing to 62 % when PCI was undertaken as an emergency procedure. Off-label use of these drugs was frequent (direct cath lab use of tirofiban in 55% of the cases; bailout use: 16% with abciximab and 26% with tirofiban). At logistic regression analysis, independent predictors of GP IIb\/IIIa receptor blocker use were emergency procedure (odds ratio 3.6, 95 % confidence interval 2.6 to 5.0, p < 0.0001) and treatment for an ACS (odds ratio 1.6, 95% confidence interval 1.3 to 2.1, p = 0.0002). An emergency procedure was the only independent predictor for the use of abciximab instead of tirofiban (odds ratio 4.1, 95% confidence interval 2.6 to 6.5, p < 0.0001). Triple periprocedural antiplatelet therapy, including aspirin, a thienopyridine and a GP IIb\/IIIa receptor blocker was administered in only 21% of cases. At discharge, all stented patients received aspirin and a thienopyridine. Despite complete procedural success in > 90% of cases, 50% of the patients were discharged on symptomatic anti-ischemic therapy.\nCONCLUSIONS: A wide gap exists between guideline recommendations and periprocedural drug therapy in PCI, the only exception being full prescription of aspirin and a thienopyridine at discharge after stenting. In patients with ACS, thienopyridine pretreatment is often used as a surrogate for GP IIb\/IIIa blockade, whose use rather is associated with emergency procedures. Off-label use of drugs is not uncommon.",

        "Abstract":"INTRODUCTION: Recent studies have shown that enoxaparin may be equally as safe and effective as unfractionated heparin during a coronary angioplasty procedure. The aim of this study was to investigate whether enoxaparin can be used effectively and safely in place of unfractionated heparin in patients undergoing emergency or programmed coronary angioplasty, regardless of the use of platelet glycoprotein IIb\/IIIa inhibitors.\nMETHODS: We compared two series of consecutive patients, who received unfractionated heparin (n = 217) or enoxaparin (n = 116) during emergency or programmed angioplasty, regardless of age, weight, renal function and the coadministration of platelet glycoprotein IIb\/IIIa inhibitors. In the patients who received enoxaparin the arterial sheaths were removed immediately after the procedure.\nRESULTS: There were no significant differences between the two groups as regards clinical characteristics or risk factors for coronary artery disease. During a 30-day follow up no major adverse cardiac events were observed (death, myocardial infarction, target vessel revascularisation). Multivariate logistic regression analysis showed no correlation between the anticoagulant used and the occurrence of major cardiac events in the two groups of patients (log odds ratio = -9.46, p = 0.89), after controlling for age, sex, administration of platelet glycoprotein IIb\/IIIa inhibitors, number of coronary lesions, number of stents used, clinical picture and risk factors for coronary artery disease. As regards the development of haematoma in the groin, the only significant independent predictive factor for this was the coadministration of platelet glycoprotein IIb\/IIIa inhibitors.\nCONCLUSIONS: The use of enoxaparin in coronary angioplasty is safe, effective and allows faster removal of sheaths and mobilisation of the patient.",

        "Published":null,
        "Abstract":"BACKGROUND: The use of the methodology of adjusted risk to check the calculation of the differences between patients, groups and populations, as regards outcomes, is being used more often in the era of modern interventional cardiology to validate a reliable and balanced comparison of results between institutions and to maintain uniformity of data, criteria and definitions with a view to carrying out multicenter studies in this area of medicine. In this way, the ability to determine which variables have greater predictive value for adverse events that result from percutaneous coronary intervention (PCI) is an extremely important tool for clinical decisions and for risk adjustment in each patient, when evaluating the quality of the health care given.\nMETHODS AND RESULTS: this work took the research design of a case-control study. The data analyzed related to all patients who had undergone PCI in an interventional cardiology unit, during 2002 (567 patients). The group of cases (33) corresponds to those patients in whom a major adverse cardiac or cerebrovascular event (MACCE) occurred during the procedure or within a 30-day period. The control group (534 patients) was made up of the rest of the population that underwent a PCI but that remained free of events in the same study period. The data on the PCIs carried out was taken from the database of the interventional cardiology unit. Analysis of the data was based on a descriptive and analytical statistical treatment (SPSS 11.5) with recourse to contingency tables, the Pearson's chi-square test, the Fisher exact test, and simple and multiple logistic regression, using odds ratios (OR) as a measure of association. The level of significance was 0.05 and the confidence interval was 95%. It should be noted that in the group of variables that showed greatest predictive value of the occurrence of an MACCE we found the following: female gender (OR = 1.593), advanced age (80 years, OR = 9.460), diabetes (OR = 3.063), chronic renal failure (OR = 3.063), depressed ejection fraction (30%, OR = 8.475), priority at PCI (OR = 7.108), multivessel disease (OR = 1.683), type C lesion (OR = 2.208), acute myocardial infarction (OR = 5.045) and cardiogenic shock (OR = 28.169).\nCONCLUSIONS: This study allowed us to identify, characterize and grade the set of variables that presented the strongest association with major adverse events that resulted from PCIs, for the population that underwent this type of procedure in an interventional coronary unit over the course of one year. At the same time, it enabled us to characterize the procedures that were carried out during this period, and also the demographic and clinical profile of the population. Although in some of the variables the OR values found were not statistically significant in either bivariate or multivariate analysis, we should point out that these variables are comparable to most results from similar multicenter international studies carried out with large populations. This type of study is an important contribution to improving the quality of health care given and to more efficient risk management in the field of interventional cardiology.",

        "Published":null,
        "Abstract":"Among patients who undergo percutaneous coronary intervention, renal impairment is associated with an excessive risk of bleeding and ischemic events. Bivalirudin provides comparable suppression of ischemic events with a decrease in bleeding events compared with heparin and glycoprotein IIb\/IIIa inhibition. We examined the relation between adverse events, renal impairment, and antithrombotic therapy within a randomized comparison. The Second Randomized Evaluation in PCI Linking Bivalirudin to Reduced Clinical Events per-protocol study population was assessed. Renal function was defined as calculated creatinine clearance <60 ml\/min. Events within the overall study population and within each study arm were assessed. Thirty-day events by renal function were compared by chi-square test and logistic regression. Late mortality was compared by log-rank test. Interaction analyses were performed. Among 5,710 patients, renal impairment was associated with increased ischemic events (hazard ratio 1.45, 95% confidence interval 1.13 to 1.88, p = 0.004), bleeding complications (hazard ratio 1.72, 95% confidence interval 1.06 to 2.80, p = 0.028), and excessive 12-month mortality (hazard ratio 3.85, 95% confidence interval 2.67 to 5.54, p <0.001). Bivalirudin provided suppression of ischemic events that was comparable to heparin and glycoprotein IIb\/IIIa inhibition regardless of renal impairment. Fewer bleeding events with bivalirudin were also evident irrespective of renal dysfunction. No interaction between treatment assignment, bleeding or ischemic complications, and renal impairment was observed. The safety and efficacy of bivalirudin compared with heparin and planned glycoprotein IIb\/IIIa inhibition in this high-risk group are comparable and consistent with the results of the overall trial.",

This study reports on our center's experience with 16 children who underwent heart transplantation.\nMETHODS: Data were obtained by retrospective review.\nRESULTS: Median age at time of review was 12.3 years (n = 16, 5.1 to 18.0 years; 9 boys, 7 girls), and at time of transplant 7.5 years (6 months to 18.0 years). Median time of sirolimus introduction was 2.7 years (1 month to 8.2 years) post-transplant. Fifteen patients were on steroids, 10 on tacrolimus (FK) and mycophenolate mofetil (MMF), 5 on FK and 1 on MMF with no calcineurin inhibitors (CNIs). The average dose of sirolimus was 0.25 mg\/kg or 7.0 mg\/m(2) to maintain a target level of 5 to 15 mug\/liter. Sirolimus was started for CAD in 6 patients (38%), rejection in 5 (31%), and in 5 with combinations of CNI intolerance, CAD, renal dysfunction and rejection. All 6 who received sirolimus for rejection (International Society for Heart and Lung Transplantation [ISHLT] Grade 3A) showed improvement on follow-up biopsies. Two of 3 who received sirolimus for renal dysfunction showed improvement (glomerular filtration rate [GFR] 43 to 67 and 32 to 106 ml\/min per 1.73 m(2), respectively). Side effects included hyperlipidemia (38%), abdominal pain (31%), mouth ulcers (26%), anemia or neutropenia (12.5%), persistent pericardial effusion (6%) and interstitial lung disease (6%). Sirolimus therapy was discontinued in 3 patients due to side effects.\nCONCLUSIONS: In this study sirolimus was found to be a valuable IS agent for the management of rejection, significant renal dysfunction and CNI side effects. These results support the need for prospective studies of the role of sirolimus in primary rejection prophylaxis, primary CAD prophylaxis and CAD regression. There also exists a need to establish an adverse event profile for this drug.",

After administration of a sedative, he complained of bilateral visual loss. His visual acuity was light perception in the right eye and no light perception in the left eye. Neither pupil reacted to light stimulus. Funduscopic findings revealed a slightly pale optic disc and renal retinopathy with macular folds in both eyes. No other neuro-ophthalmologic or neurologic abnormalities were observed. Based on these findings, the patient was diagnosed as having bilateral posterior ischemic optic neuropathy and was treated with intravenous corticosteroids. From about 50 days after the operation, visual acuity gradually improved, and papillary light reaction was immediate. In cranial magnetic resonance imaging, no characteristic lesions of multiple sclerosis could be detected. Six months later, visual acuity improved to 20\/20 in both eyes.\nCONCLUSION: In patients with renal failure and underlying systemic vascular disease and anemia, the risk of posterior ischemic optic neuropathy should be considered even in minor surgery with stable vital signs and without severe blood loss.",

All patients received the same anesthetic protocol and same dopamine infusion protocol (2 mg\/kg(-1)\/min(-1)) during the study. In addition to dopamine infusion 15 patients received enalaprilat infusion (0.06 mg\/kg(-1)\/hr(-1)) during CPB. Blood creatinine, urea levels, and creatinine clearance (CLcr) were measured and cardiac output (CO) was calculated by echocardiography preoperatively and on the 6th postoperative day. Mean arterial pressure (MAP), central venous pressure (CVP), systemic vascular resistance (SVR) measurements were recorded during the operation and during postoperative 24 hours.\nRESULTS: In the control group postoperative blood creatinine and urea levels were significantly higher and CLcr measurements were significantly lower than the preoperative values (p<0.05). These values did not change in the enalaprilat group. Mean arterial pressure was similar in both groups (p>0.05), but SVR was lower (p<0.05) and CVP was higher (p<0.05) in the enalaprilat group than in the control group. In the enalaprilat group postoperative CO measurements were higher than the preoperative values (p<0.05).\nCONCLUSION: Our results demonstrate that enalaprilat infusion during CPB improves renal function and CO measurements in the early postoperative period.",

        "Abstract":"PURPOSE: We assessed the results of abdominal aortic aneurysm (AAA) repair with the Powerlink bifurcated endovascular graft compared with open AAA repair.\nMETHOD: A prospective controlled multicenter trial of the Powerlink system for endovascular aneurysm repair was conducted at 15 sites as part of a pivotal US Food and Drug Administration trial. Between July 2000 and March 2003, 258 patients (192 test patients, 66 control patients) were enrolled. Stent grafts were oversized by 10% to 20% relative to computed tomography scan (CT)-based diameter measurements. All repairs were performed in the operating room through 1 surgically exposed femoral artery and a contralateral 9F sheath percutaneously placed. Results were assessed with contrast material-enhanced CT scans and plain abdominal x-ray studies at 1, 6, and 12 months, and annually postoperatively.\nRESULTS: Patients were followed up for a mean of 22 months (median, 24 months). Technical success was achieved in 97.9% of patients, with 4 failed insertions (3 early conversions because of deployment issues, 1 access failure). There were no significant differences in mortality between the Powerlink and control groups, and only 1 death was procedure-related. Blood loss (341 mL vs 1583 mL; P < .0001), operative time (136 minutes vs 222 minutes; P < .0001), intensive care unit stay (0.78 days vs 4.1 days; P < .0001), and hospital length of stay (3.3 days vs 9.5 days; P < .0001) were significantly less in the Powerlink cohort compared with the control group. There were significantly fewer adverse events (myocardial infarction, P = .0131; renal failure, P = .0042; gastrointestinal complications, P = .0125) in the perioperative period in the Powerlink cohort compared with the control group, but in the longer follow-up interval adverse event-free survival was equivalent between groups (P = .456, log-rank test). At the time of the first-month CT scan, endoleaks were noted in 25 patients, yielding a 30-day endoleak rate of 22.7%. Type II endoleaks predominated, and there were no type III or IV endoleaks. Secondary procedures were performed in 19 patients (10%), for treatment of endoleak (n = 10), limb obstruction (n = 7), and other causes (n = 2). There were 3 graft migrations (2.2%), 1 of which resulted in an endoleak. There were no ruptures, graft fabric defects, or wire fractures. Significant reduction in mean AAA diameter and volume was noted at every follow-up interval. Increase in AAA diameter was noted in only 1.5% of patients at 24 months.\nCONCLUSION: The Powerlink system appears safe, and effectively protects patients from AAA rupture over the intermediate term. The graft and stent materials have thus far been free from failure and fatigue. Percutaneous contralateral limb access facilitates graft placement in patients with disadvantaged access routes. Endovascular aneurysm repair with the Powerlink system produces significantly fewer early adverse events compared with open AAA repair, but mortality is equivalent with both procedures. Careful follow-up over the longer term is necessary to ensure the durability of these results.",

Its favorable effects on preventing thrombus formation may have deleterious effects on hemostasis in patients undergoing coronary surgery.\nMETHODS: Data were collected prospectively on 312 consecutive urgent or emergent coronary artery bypass patients from July 1999 through April 2001 at a tertiary care center. Patients were stratified into three groups: clopidogrel within 4 days of operation (n = 41), clopidogrel continued until 5 to 8 days before operation (n = 39), and clopidogrel discontinued more than 8 days before operation or were never taking clopidogrel (n = 232).\nRESULTS: Preoperative and intraoperative characteristics were similar among all groups. Mediastinal and pericardial chest tube losses in the first 24 hours were 1,044 +\/- 750 mL in the clopidogrel within 4 days group, 528 +\/- 250 mL in the clopidogrel 5 to 8 days group, and 573 +\/- 329 mL in the clopidogrel more than 8 days group (p < 0.01). The mean total blood product transfusions were 12.2 +\/- 15.4 U, 1.2 +\/- 2.0 U, and 2.6 +\/- 5.7 U, respectively (p < 0.001). Reoperation for bleeding was noted in 14.6%, 2.6%, and 1.7%, respectively (p = 0.002). The median hospital lengths of stay for the three groups were 9 days, 7 days, and 7 days, respectively (p = 0.018). There were no statistically significant differences in mortality rate, myocardial infarction, stroke, mediastinitis, or postoperative renal failure among the groups. Multivariable analysis revealed that clopidogrel within 0 to 4 days of operation was an independent predictor of transfusion requirements (OR 4.22, 95% confidence interval [CI] 2.07, 9.34, p = 0.001), intensive care unit (ICU) length of stay (OR 3.14, 95% CI 1.40, 7.04, p = 0.006), and total hospital length of stay (coefficient 7.65, se 2.41, p = 0.002).\nCONCLUSIONS: Clopidogrel within 4 days of coronary bypass surgery is associated with increased blood losses and reoperation for bleeding and, according to multivariable models, is an independent risk factor for increased transfusion requirements and prolonged ICU and hospital length of stay.",

Ascorbic acid, 3 g at least 2 hours before the procedure and 2 g in the night and the morning after the procedure, or placebo was administered orally. Contrast-mediated nephropathy was defined by an absolute increase of serum creatinine > or =0.5 mg\/dL or a relative increase of > or =25% measured 2 to 5 days after the procedure. Contrast-mediated nephropathy occurred in 11 of the 118 patients (9%) in the ascorbic acid group and in 23 of the 113 patients (20%) in the placebo group (odds ratio [OR], 0.38; 95% confidence interval [CI], 0.17 to 0.85; P=0.02).

        "Published":null,
        "Abstract":"Ischemia-reperfusion (I-R) injury in transplanted kidney, a key pathogenic event of delayed graft function (DGF), is characterized by tubular cell apoptosis and interstitial inflammation. Akt-mammalian target of rapamycin-S6k and NF-kappaB-inducing kinase (NIK)-NF-kappaB axis are the two main signaling pathways regulating cell survival and inflammation. Rapamycin, an immunosuppressive drug inhibiting the Akt axis, is associated with a prolonged DGF. The aim of this study was to evaluate Akt and NF-kappaB axis activation in patients who had DGF and received or not rapamycin and in a pig model of I-R and the role of coagulation priming in this setting. In graft biopsies from patients who were not receiving rapamycin, phosphorylated Akt increased in proximal tubular, interstitial, and mesangial cells with a clear nuclear translocation. The same pattern of activation was observed for S6k and NIK. However, in rapamycin-treated patients, a significant reduction of S6k but not Akt and NIK activation was observed. A time-dependent activation of phosphatidylinositol 3-kinase, Akt, S6k, and NIK was observed in the experimental model with the same pattern reported for transplant recipients who did not receive rapamycin. Extensive interstitial and glomerular fibrin deposition was observed both in pig kidneys upon reperfusion and in DGF human biopsies. It is interesting that the activation of both Akt and NIK-NF-kappaB pathways was induced by thrombin in cultured proximal tubular cells. In conclusion, the data suggest that (1) coagulation may play a pathogenic role in I-R injury; (2) the Akt axis is activated after I-R, and its inhibition may explain the prolonged DGF observed in rapamycin-treated patients; and (3) NIK activation in I-R and DGF represents a proinflammatory, rapamycin-insensitive signal, potentially leading to progressive graft injury.",

N-acetylcysteine (NAC) has been shown to reduce the risk of nephropathy; however, the impact of NAC on long-term clinical outcomes has not been assessed.\nMETHODS: This randomized, double-blind, placebo-controlled trial enrolled 180 patients with moderate renal dysfunction undergoing PCI or coronary angiography with a high likelihood of ad hoc PCI; 171 patients completed the clinical follow-up. Patients received oral NAC (2000 mg\/dose, n = 95) or placebo (n = 85) twice a day for 3 doses if randomized the night prior to the procedure, and 2 doses if randomized the day of the procedure. The primary end point was the incidence of a > or =25% increase in serum creatinine level 48 to 72 hours after PCI. Secondary end points were the inhospital incidence of death, nonfatal myocardial infarction, or urgent dialysis, and the 9-month incidence of death, nonfatal myocardial infarction, need for dialysis, or repeat hospitalization for cardiac reasons.\nRESULTS: CAN occurred in 9.6% of patients assigned to NAC and 22.2% of patients assigned to placebo (P =.04); 1 patient receiving NAC required urgent dialysis. The inhospital composite end point occurred in 7 (7.4%) NAC-treated and 3 (3.5%) placebo-treated patients, P = NS. At 9 months, the composite end point occurred in 23 (24.2%) NAC-treated patients and 18 (21.2%) placebo-treated, P = NS.\nCONCLUSION: Although high-dose NAC prevented periprocedural CAN, this benefit did not translate into a decrease in adverse outcomes over 9 months.

        "Published":null,
        "Abstract":"Technological advancements have lead to dramatic improvements in stentgraft device design resulting in more trackable delivery systems and transrenal uncovered stents and barbs for better fixation. Transrenal bare-stents may limit stentgraft migration, particularly in patients with short or flared proximal aortic necks. However, potential disadvantages might be in worsening renal function, particularly in patients with preexisting renal insufficiency. We retrospectively analyzed our recent 7 year experience of patients undergoing endovascular aneurysm repair (EVAR) using a variety of stentgrafts with and without transrenal bare-stent fixation. Patients were divided into 2 groups; infrarenal fixation (IRF) vs transrenal fixation (TRF), or patients with preoperative serum Cr values that were normal (= or <1.5 mg\/dl) vs slightly elevated (1.6-2 mg\/dl), vs markedly elevated (2.1- 3.5 mg\/dl). The exclusion criteria included patients with chronic renal insufficiency (CRI) on hemodialysis, and preoperative high-grade renal artery stenoses requiring angioplasty and stenting. Of 705 patients that underwent EVAR, 496 (IRF: 385 [78%], and TRF: 111 [22%]) were available with routine evaluations of serum Cr and CT scans. Preexisting comorbidities, mean procedure contrast volume, and postprocedure follow-up were similar in both groups. In the immediate postoperative period, mean serum Cr did not change significantly in either the IRF group (1.3+\/-0.7 mg\/dl to 1.2+\/-0.9 mg\/dl) or the TRF group (1.3+\/-0.5 mg\/dl to 1.3+\/-0.6 mg\/dl). Mean serum Cr did, however, significantly increase over longer follow-up in both groups: 1.4+\/-0.8 mg\/dl for IRF (P<0.03), and 1.5 +\/- 0.8 mg\/dl for TRF (P<0.01). Cr clearance was similarly unchanged in the immediate postoperative period (58+\/-23 to 61+\/-25 ml\/min\/1.73 m2 for IRF group, 53+\/-17 to 55+\/-17 ml\/min\/1.73 m2 for TRF group), but was significantly decreased in longer follow-up (53+\/-23 ml\/min\/1.73 m2 for IRF, p<0.02: and 48+\/-16 ml\/min\/1.73 m2 for TRF, P<0.01). There were no significant differences in serum Cr increase (p=0.19) or Cr clearance decrease (p=0.68) between the IRF and TRF groups. Small renal infarcts were noted in 6 patients (1.6%) in the IRF group, and in 8 patients (7%) in the TRF group (p=0.37). Of patients with normal preoperative renal function, renal dysfunction developed in 7.7% of IRF group and 6.1% of TRF group (p=0.76). In patients with preexisting CRI, renal dysfunction developed in 18.2% of IRF group, and 17.1% of TRF group (p=0.95). Eight patients with postoperative renal dysfunction, 5 (1.3%) from IRF group and 3 (2.7%) from TRF group subsequently required hemodialysis, and this difference was not statistically significant (p=0.91). We also analyzed 200 consecutive patients undergoing EVAR with intra-arterial contrast agents with and without preexisting CRI not on dialysis. The groups were identified on the basis of preprocedure serum Cr: group 1 (n=108), Cr less than 1.5 mg\/dL (normal range); group 2 (n=65), Cr 1.5 to 2.0 mg\/dL; group 3 (n=27), Cr 2.1 to 3.5 mg\/dL. Routine precautions in patients with CRI included preoperative intravenous hydration with 2 L of normal saline solution, discontinuation of all nephrotoxic drugs, intraoperative administration of mannitol (0.5 g\/kg intravenously), and use of nonionic, low osmolar intra-arterial contrast agent (Omnipaque 350). One-hundred and eight patients had normal renal function (group 1), and 92 patients had preexisting CRI with baseline Cr 1.5 to 2.0 mg\/dL (group 2, n=65) or 2.1 to 3.5 mg\/dL (group 3, n=27). Comorbid conditions included coronary artery disease (group 1, 51%; group 2, 49%; group 3, 59%), hypertension (group 1, 39%; group 2, 46%; group 3, 52%), and diabetes mellitus (group 1, 25%; group 2, 35%; group 3, 48%). In groups 1, 2, and 3, the mean volume of low osmolar contrast agent used was 210 cc, 160 cc, 130 cc, respectively; hemodynamic instability developed in 3, 1, and 1 patient, respectively. The incidence of postoperative complications between the 3 study groups was not statistically different. In grications between the 3 study groups was not statistically different. In group 1 a transient increase in serum Cr (>30% over baseline and >1.4 mg\/dL) was noted in 3 patients (2.7%), 2 of whom (1.9%) required temporary hemodialysis and 1 (0.9%) who died of renal failure. In group 2 a transient increase in serum Cr was noted in 2 patients (3.1%); both patients (3.1%) required temporary hemodialysis, and 1 patient (1.5%) died of renal failure. In group 3 a transient increase in serum Cr was noted in 2 patients (7.4%); 1 patient (3.7%) required temporary hemodialysis, and 1 patient (3.7%) died of renal failure. Perioperative hypotension significantly increased the risk for elevated serum Cr and death (p<0.05), and larger contrast volume was associated with an increase in serum Cr (p<0.05) during the postoperative period. Following EVAR renal function declines slightly with both IRF and TRF. Our data show no overall difference between patients with IRF and TRF with respect to infarcts, decline in renal function, or onset of dialysis. There were a slightly greater number of renal infarcts in the TRF group, but these infarcts were clinically inconsequential. In patients with CRI, EVAR with intra-arterial radiographic contrast agents is believed to impair renal function, and CRI is considered a relative contraindication to the procedure. Results of our investigation indicate that risk for worsening renal insufficiency, dialysis, and death is only slightly and not significantly greater in patients with CRI compared with patients with normal renal function. With appropriate precautions of avoiding perioperative hypotension and limiting the volume of nonionic contrast agents, CRI need not be a contraindication for EVAR with intra-arterial contrast agents.",

Patients were evaluated for clinical risk factors (age>70 years, histories of MI, angina, diabetes mellitus, stroke, renal failure, heart failure and pulmonary disease), DSE, statin and beta-blocker use. The main outcome was a composite of perioperative mortality and MI within 30 days of surgery.\nRESULTS: Perioperative mortality or MI occurred in 51 (8.9%) patients.

The recommended dose of enoxaparin of 1 mg\/kg BID was used throughout the population except when physicians decided on dose reduction because of a history of a recent bleeding event or because of a high bleeding risk. Anti-factor Xa activity was >0.5 IU\/mL in 93% of patients; subtherapeutic anti-Xa levels (<0.5 IU\/mL) were associated with lower doses of enoxaparin. The 30-day mortality rate was significantly associated with low anti-Xa levels (<0.5 IU\/mL), with a >3-fold increase in mortality compared with the patients with anti-Xa levels in the target range of 0.5 to 1.2 IU\/mL (P=0.004). Multivariate analysis revealed low anti-Xa activity as an independent predictor of 30-day mortality at least as strong as age, left ventricular function, and renal function. In contrast, anti-Xa activity did not predict major bleeding complications within the range of anti-Xa levels observed in this study.\nCONCLUSIONS: In this large unselected cohort of patients with UA\/NSTEMI patients, low anti-Xa activity on enoxaparin treatment is independently associated with 30-day mortality, which highlights the need for achieving at least the minimum prescribed anti-Xa level of 0.5 IU\/mL with enoxaparin whenever possible.",

CIN was defined as an increase of Cr > or = 0.5 mg\/dL or > or = 25% 48 hours after cath\/PCI.\nRESULTS: CIN occurred in 3 of 36 (8%) patients of the NAC group vs. 11 of 44 (25%) in the placebo group (P = 0.051; OR 3.7, 95% CI 0.94-14.4). Serum creatinine (mean +\/- SD) remained stable in the NAC group after cath\/PCI (2.02 +\/- 0.56 vs. 2.10 +\/- 0.81 mg\/dL; P = 0.34), but increased after cath\/PCI in the placebo group (1.93 +\/- 0.53 vs. 2.10 +\/- 0.74 mg\/dL; P < 0.01).\nCONCLUSIONS: An abbreviated, higher dose regimen of NAC prevents the rise of serum creatinine 48 hours after cath\/PCI, and may prevent CIN after cath\/PCI.",

        "Abstract":"BACKGROUND: Previous studies of the glycoprotein IIb-IIIa inhibitor eptifibatide have included patients with moderate renal impairment (serum creatinine concentrations, 2.0-4.0 mg\/dL). In these patients, adjustment of the standard infusion dose (2.0 microg\/kg.min) to 1.0 microg\/kg.min was recommended on empiric grounds because approximately 50% of eptifibatide is cleared renally.\nOBJECTIVE: The present study was designed to assess teh pharmacokinetic and pharmacodynamic properties of eptifibatide in subjects with various levels of creatinine clearance (CrCl), a parameter that is a more accurate indicator of renal function than serum creatinine concentration to determine the appropriate dose adjustment in patients with reduced renal function. A secondary objective was to determine the tolerability of eptifibatide when administered to patients with decreased renal function.\nMETHODS: This open-label study was concluded at 3 US sites experienced in conducting similar studies. Subjects with differing renal function (normal [group 1, CrCl > 80 mL\/min], mild renal impairment [group 2, CrCl 51-80 mL\/min], moderate renal impairment [group 3, CrCl 30-50 mL\/min], or severe renal impairment [group 4, CrCl <30 mL\/min]) received a 24-hour eptifibatide infusion of 2.0 microg\/kg.min (groups 1, 2, and 3) or 1.0 microg\/kg.min (group 4). The primary end point was the eptifibatide steady-state plasma concentration; the secondary end points included inhibition of platelet aggregation and eptifibatide clearance, terminal plasma half-life, and area under the plasma concentration-time curve. In addition to analyses performed for each group, pharmacokinetic models were estimated and eptifibatide clearance was related to CrCl as a continuous variable by linear regression. All adverse events were recorded, with particular attention to bleeding.\nRESULTS: Thirty-one subjects (21 men, 10 women; mean age, 58.5 years [range, 44-73 years]; mean body weight, 81.6 kg [range, 51.5-105.1 kg]; mean height, 162.9 cm [range, 150-183 cm]) were included in the study. A strong correlation was found between eptifibatide clearance and CrCl. A tree-based analytic model indicated that the optimal discrete break point for the purpose of dose adjustment was a CrCl of 55.85 mL\/min, which was rounded to 50 mL\/min for practical clinical reasons. In patients with moderate or severe renal impairment (CrCl < or = 50 mL\/min), clearance rates and steady-state concentrations of eptifibatide were approximately 50% lower and almost 2-fold higher, respectively, than in patients with normal renal function or mild renal impairment (CrCl > 50 mL\/min). Inhibition of platelet aggregation exceeded the clinically significant threshold of 80% in all groups. Five subjects had a mild bleeding event and 4 subjects experienced mild to moderate nonbleeding events, 2 of which were considered drug-related by the investigator. None of the events required intervention.\nCONCLUSIONS: In this study, moderate to severe renal impairment was associated with an approximately 50% reduction in total eptifibatide clearance and a corresponding doubling of plasma eptifibatide concentration. Based on these findings, in patients with moderately or severely impaired renal function (calculated CrCl < or =50 mL\/min) who are scheduled for percutaneous coronary intervention or who have non-ST-segment elevation acute coronary syndromes, it is appropriate to reduce the infusion dose of eptifibatide by 50% (from 2 to 1 microg\/kg.min). Because the bolus dose(s) is (are) used to establish the initial targeted plasma eptifibatide concentrations, which are independent of clearance, and given that the volume of distribution did not correlate with renal function, no adjustment of the bolus dose(s) is required.",

Under the circumstances of frozen medical budgets in Germany, there may also be a shift toward implantation of a drug-eluting stent (DES) for indications not yet evaluated by RCTs.\nMETHODS: The authors analyzed the data of the German Cypher Registry a nationwide registry which was initiated in parallel to the launch of the first DES, the Cypher stent, in April 2002.\nRESULTS: From April 2002 until December 2003, 3,579 interventions using a Cypher stent at 102 centers were included in the German Cypher Registry. This reflects a proportion of this DES compared to all stents implanted at the participating centers of < 10%. Patients' median age was 63.4 years (quartiles: 55-70 years) with 75% men. Renal insufficiency was seen in 10.1%, previous myocardial infarction in 37%, prior percutaneous coronary intervention (PCI) in 54.6%, and prior coronary artery bypass grafting (CABG) in 18.7%. In a large proportion of interventions, Cypher stents were implanted in lesions or in clinical situations not yet evaluated by RCTs: 10.1% ST elevation myocardial infarction, 1.8% cardiogenic shock, 2.1% left main stenoses, 5.5% CABG lesions, 23.2% in-stent stenosis, and 6% chronic total occlusions. PCI before DES implantation was performed in 65.5% of cases, a mean of 1.02 +\/- 0.43 Cypher stents per lesion were implanted with a median sum length of all Cypher stents per lesion of 18 mm (quartiles: 13-21 mm). Maximum median balloon diameter during stent implantation was 3.00 mm (quartiles: 2.75-3.00 mm). Acute complication rate was low, with 0.2% deaths, 0.3% subacute stent thromboses, 1.3% myocardial infarctions, 2.1% urgent PCIs, and 0.2% CABGs.\nCONCLUSION: In about one half of the patients included into the German Cypher Registry, the DES were implanted in lesions that were excluded from RCTs. The use of this sirolimus-eluting coronary stent in \"real life\" conditions was found to be safe concerning acute complications.",

        "Abstract":"Atherosclerotic renal artery stenosis (ARAS) is associated with two common clinical syndromes: renovascular hypertension and ischemic nephropathy, which often coexist. The ensuing renovascular disease constitutes the fastest-growing etiology of end-stage renal disease. Diagnostic work-up for hemodynamical significant renal artery stenosis should be restricted to patients suspected to be at moderate or high risk for renovascular disease. Patients at moderate risk should first undergo a screening test, like Doppler ultrasonography or captopril-enhanced scintigraphy. In case of a positive screening test, renal artery imaging with either spiral computed tomography angiography or magnetic resonance angiography with Gadolinium is indicated. Patients at high risk for renovascular disease may be directly referred for intra-arterial renal artery angiography, the golden standard diagnostic procedure. A renal artery stenosis with narrowing of > 50-60% of the lumen, is considered hemodynamically significant, and may be suitable for treatment with angioplasty or angioplasty plus stent placement (in case of osteal renal artery stenosis). The therapeutic approach of the hypertensive patient with a hemodynamically significant renal artery stenosis is currently a matter of great debate. In any case optimal medical therapy with antihypertensive, lipid-lowering, and platelet-inhibiting drugs should be instituted, since such approach may not only prevent the progression to end-stage renal disease, but may also prevent the progression of extra-renal vascular disease, which affects the majority of these patients. Current evidence suggests that angioplasty (with additional stent placement in case of osteal renal artery stenosis) may benefit a subset of patients with significant RAS, i.e. patients with a resistance index < 80% at the level of the segmental renal arteries, and patients with bilateral RAS or patients with unilateral RAS with a unique functioning kidney. Prospective, randomized and controlled studies with clearly defined clinical endpoints are needed to better define the absolute and relative indications of angioplasty (plus stenting) in the setting of renal artery stenosis.",

The aim of this study was to compare the effects of tacrolimus (Tac) and cyclosporine microemulsion (CsA) based immunosuppressive protocols using protocol biopsies from well-functioning renal allografts. 35 consecutive renal transplant patients were randomized to Tac (n: 17) versus CsA (n: 18) treatment arms. Patient age and sex, donor type and age, histocompatibility, cold ischemia time and prior delayed graft function were similar between the two groups. Treatment protocol consisted of prednisolone, azathioprine and Tac or CsA. Biopsies performed on the third, sixth and twelfth months were blindly evaluated by the same pathologist. The incidences of acute rejection (AR) episodes among CsA vs Tac groups were 33% vs 29%, respectively (NS). The Creatinine level was lower in Tac than CsA, although it was not significant (Table). Subclinical AR and subclinical chronic allograft nephropathy were detected on protocol biopsies in 3 (2 CsA, 1 Tac) and 12 (7 CsA, 5 Tac) patients, respectively. Acute lesion score at the third month PBx was significantly lower in the Tac group (p < 0.05). Chronic lesion scores in all biopsies were lower in the Tac group, although not significantly.

        "Abstract":"INTRODUCTION: Established American Heart Association guidelines recommend the use of statin drugs, angiotensin converting enzyme (ACE) inhibitors, and antiplatelet agents in patients with systemic atherosclerosis, such as those undergoing operative intervention to treat peripheral atherosclerotic disease. Many of these patients have not received treatment of coronary heart disease and have not been prescribed these medications. Whether statin drugs and ACE inhibitors confer an improvement in graft patency, limb salvage, and operative mortality is unknown.\nMETHODS: Consecutive patients who underwent infrainguinal bypass between 1997 and 2002 were evaluated for demographic data, comorbid disease, medication use, as well as cumulative graft patency, limb salvage, and mortality. Univariate, multivariate logistical regression, and Kaplan-Meier analyses were performed. P <.05 was considered significant.\nRESULTS: Two hundred ninety-three patients (mean age, 64 years; 67% men) underwent 338 infrainguinal bypass procedures with autologous vein (n = 218), prosthetic grafts (n = 88), or composite prosthetic-vein grafts (n = 32). Limb salvage was the operative indication in 75% of procedures. Coexisting diseases included hypertension (70%), diabetes (52%), hyperlipidemia (37%), coronary heart disease (51%), congestive heart failure (14%), and active tobacco use (30%). Statin drugs were taken by 56% of patients, ACE inhibitors by 54% of patients, and antiplatelet agents or warfarin sodium (Coumadin) by 93% of patients. Postoperative graft surveillance was done in 39% of patients. Cumulative graft patency was 73%, limb salvage was 85%, and mortality was 9%, with a mean follow-up of 17 months. Factors independently associated with increased graft patency included statin drug use (odds ratio [OR], 3.7; 95% confidence interval [CI], 2.1-6.4), male sex (OR, 2.8; 95% CI, 1.6-5.0), and graft surveillance (OR, 2.4; 95% CI, 1.3-4.5). Factors associated with decreased amputation rate were statin drug use (OR, 0.34; 95% CI, 6.15-0.77) and graft surveillance (OR, 0.23; 95% CI, 6.1-0.63). Factors associated with decreased mortality included graft surveillance (OR, 0.18; 95% CI, 0.1-0.56), whereas congestive heart failure (OR, 6.5; 95% CI, 2.5-17) and hemodialysis-dependent renal failure (OR, 29; 95% CI, 6.1-140) were associated with increased mortality. Kaplan-Meier analysis showed that only ACE inhibitors were associated with lower mortality (P =.05)\nCONCLUSIONS: Patients undergoing infrainguinal bypass are undertreated with respect to cardioprotective medications. ACE inhibitor use is associated with lower mortality, and statin drug use is associated with improved graft patency and limb salvage. Institution of consensus guidelines concerning these medications should be considered by all vascular specialists, including vascular surgeons.",

We report our experience using basiliximab with mycophenolate mofetil, a calcineurin inhibitor, and steroids in kidney transplantation.\nMETHODS: We retrospectively analyzed 127 patients who received their first kidney transplant between September 1, 1998, and December 30, 2000, including 59 who received basiliximab (22 living and 37 cadaveric donor recipients) and the 68 that did not receive this antibody (31 living and 37 cadaveric donor recipients). The groups were demographically comparable for risk factors such as race, peak of panel-reactive antibody, delayed graft function, donor age, and cold ischemia time. The analysis assessed serum creatinine levels, acute rejection, cytomegalovirus infection, and posttransplant lymphoproliferative disease incidence as well as patient and graft survival at 6 months.\nRESULTS: Serum creatinine levels were 3 +\/- 3.1 and 2.6 +\/- 2.5 mg\/dL (P =.346) at discharge, 1.5 +\/- 0.6 and 1.7 +\/- 1.1 mg\/dL (P =.098) at 1 month, and 1.5 +\/- 0.7 and 1.6 +\/- 0.7 mg\/dL (P =.454) at 6 months posttransplantation for patients treated with versus without basiliximab, respectively. Only one episode of acute rejection was seen among patients treated with basiliximab within 1 month posttransplantation versus three episodes among patients treated without basiliximab (P =.382). Three patients (5.1%) treated with basiliximab and two patients (2.9%) treated without basiliximab developed acute rejection within 6 months posttransplantation (P =.536). Patient and graft survivals at 6 months posttransplantation were not significantly different between patients treated with versus without basiliximab (100% and 100% versus 100% and 98.3%, respectively). There was no increased incidence of cytomegalovirus infection with the use of basiliximab (5.1% vs 5.9%, P =.844). There was only one case of posttransplant lymphoproliferative disease within 6 months posttransplantation in a patient treated without basiliximab.\nCONCLUSION: These data suggest that the routine addition of basiliximab to a mycophenolate mofetil-based regimens does not appear to be warranted.

There have been some concerns about the function of kidney grafts harvested by laparoscopic procedures. We report our results of LAP.\nMATERIALS AND METHODS: Prospective data were collected for our donor nephrectomy operations. A telephone survey was done by an independent investigator on the impact of surgery on quality of life. Graft function was also evaluated by serial serum creatinine and mercaptoacetyltriglycine renal nuclear scans.\nRESULTS: A total of 100 patients were included in the study; of whom 55 underwent open donor nephrectomy (OD), 28 underwent LAP and 17 underwent hand assisted donor nephrectomy (HAL). Mean patient age was 39 +\/- 12 years and it was similar in all groups. Mean operative time was 306 +\/- 40 minutes for LAP, 294 +\/- 42 minutes for HAL and 163 +\/- 24 minutes for OD (p = 0.001). Laparoscopic operative time was decreased to 180 +\/- 56 minutes for LAP and 155 +\/- 40 minutes for HAL in the last 10 patients. Mean estimated blood loss was 200 +\/- 107 cc for LAP, 167 +\/- 70 cc for HAL and 320 +\/- 99 cc for OD (p = 0.0001). Mean warm ischemia time was 3 +\/- 2 minutes for LAP, 2 +\/- 2 minutes for HAL and 2 +\/- 1 minutes for OD (p = 0.002). Postoperative hospitalization was 2 +\/- 2 days for LAP and 3 +\/- 2 days for OD (p = 0.01). LAP required 30% less narcotic medicine than OD postoperatively (p = 0.04). There were no major complications in LAP cases and no complete or partial graft loss was noted. Mean followup was 7 months. Recipient creatinine was not significantly different for kidneys harvested by LAP or OD (p = 0.5). Diuretic mercaptoacetyltriglycine renograms were performed in all recipients 1 to 3 days after surgery and mean effective renal plasma flow was similar for the 3 groups (p = 0.9). According to telephone survey results 85% of LAP, 71% of HAL and 43% of OD patients reported a return to normal physical activity within 4 weeks after surgery. Similarly 74% of LAP, 62% of HAL and 26% of OD patients were able to return to work within 4 weeks after surgery.\nCONCLUSIONS: Our data show no significant difference in graft function between LAP and OD. LAP and HAL were safe and complications were minimal. The main difference was that patients treated with LAP and HAL returned to normal physical activity and work significantly earlier than those who underwent OD.",

Two groups of immunosuppressive regimens were compared: group A received 2 g of methylprednisolone intraoperatively followed by a rapid reduction with intention to withdraw by month 4, continuing on Neoral monotherapy. Cellcept was also given for 2 months in the absence or for up to 4 months in the presence of rejection. Group B received the same immunosuppressive regimen but, in addition, daclizumab 1 to 1.5 mg\/kg on day 1 and day 5 posttransplant. Rejection diagnosis is made on histology basis. Protocol biopsies were performed in all the patients on day 7 and if indicated by biochemistry thereafter.\nRESULTS: Both groups were similar in terms of preoperative CHILD score, serum creatinine, incidence of status I, donor and recipient age and ischemia times.

Patients presenting with acute coronary syndromes (ACS) of ST- and non-ST-segment elevation myocardial infarction (STEMI and NSTEMI, respectively) or unstable angina develop mural thrombi within minutes of plaque disruption or erosion. Initial acute therapy includes heparin and aspirin. Up to 60% of patients have coronary revascularization to reduce the high risk of death, new myocardial infarction (MI), or recurrent angina. In addition, heparin may initiate a serious allergic, prothrombotic drug reaction, heparin-induced thrombocytopenia (HIT), in 1-5% of patients. Acute cessation of heparin and initiation of direct thrombin inhibitor (DTI) therapy for suspected HIT are vital and well established. Several clinical trials comparing DTIs with heparin have been done in ACS and percutaneous coronary intervention (PCI), and have shown excellent potency in inhibiting thrombus formation and reducing coronary events. An overview of results from published studies evaluating the use of bivalent and univalent DTIs in the cardiovascular patient is presented. Four DTIs are discussed: two r-hirudins (lepirudin and desirudin), both bivalent with stable chain and renal excretion; bivalirudin, bivalent with rapid-chain metabolism; and argatroban, univalent with hepatic metabolism. The extensive clinical experience with r-hirudin in cardiovascular patients suggests that it is an excellent choice for managing patients with HIT and is easy to use in converting to warfarin, since it does not significantly change the prothrombin time.",

One-hundred patients with a preoperative serum creatinine level <or=1.5 mg\/dL were prospectively randomized into 4 groups: 1). placebo, 2). mannitol 1 g\/kg added to the CPB prime, 3). dopamine 2 microg kg(-1x. min(-1) from the induction of anesthesia to 1 h post-CPB, or 4). mannitol plus dopamine. The primary outcome measure was beta(2)M excretion rate at 1 h post-CPB. Secondary outcome measures included beta(2)M excretion rate at 6 and 24 h post-CPB; urinary flow rate and creatinine clearance at 1, 6, and 24 h post-CPB; and the highest postoperative serum creatinine level. Length of intensive care stay and hospitalization, as well as adverse events, were also considered secondary outcomes. Dopamine significantly increased beta(2)M excretion rate at 1 h post-CPB (2.48 +\/- 3.61 microg\/min) compared with placebo (0.59 +\/- 1.04 microg\/min; P = 0.001). This effect was not ameliorated by the addition of mannitol (beta(2)M excretion rate, 2.05 +\/- 2.77 microg\/min; P = 0.007 compared with placebo). beta(2)M excretion rate was similar in patients given placebo or mannitol alone (P = 0.831). Rather than being a protective drug in the setting of CPB, dopamine alone or in combination with mannitol increases beta(2)M excretion rate, which may be a measure of renal tubular dysfunction. The clinical implications of this increase and whether it is also seen in patients with established renal dysfunction undergoing CPB require additional investigation.\nIMPLICATIONS: In many clinical settings, an increased beta-2-microglobulin (beta(2)M) excretion rate indicates renal tubular injury. In this cardiopulmonary bypass (CPB) study, a dopamine infusion (alone or with mannitol) resulted in an increased beta(2)M excretion rate. It is unclear whether this dopamine-related increase implies renal injury after CPB, and further investigations are required to examine the mechanism\/clinical relevance of this observation.",

        "Abstract":"Compartment syndrome is a documented and potentially lethal complication of thrombolytic therapy. With the increasing use of catheter-directed thrombolytic therapy, a high index of suspicion for the potential occurrence of this surgical emergency must be maintained. Errors of omission in the diagnosis of compartment syndrome, even for a few hours, may lead rapidly to limb loss, renal failure, and possibly death. The authors present a case of compartment syndrome arising in the forearm of a patient being treated with continuous catheter-directed thrombolytic therapy for an occluded arterial bypass graft associated with an ischemic lower extremity. Specific to this presentation is their management of compartment syndrome during thrombolytic therapy as well as previously unreported use of a homograft (cadaveric skin) to control ongoing blood loss from a fasciotomy site in this fully anticoagulated patient. The authors think their management in this case may help to provide direction to others faced with a similar, increasingly common, surgical dilemma.",

The patient mean age was 52 years (DS 13,67) including 96 (58.90%) men and 67 (41.10%) women. Cold ischemia time was 19 hours (DS 6,79). Only 2 patients presented with PRA >50%. For prophylactic immunosuppression, 67.13% of patients received triple therapy with CNI (cyclosporine 49.65% or tacrolimus 17.48%), MMF (66.43%) or AZA (10.49%), and steroids. Incidence of acute rejection (AR) at 12 months was 12.27% (1.84% steroid-resistant). In subgroup analysis, AR was 13.5% in nondiabetics and 4.5% in diabetics, including 3 steroid-resistant episodes (1.84%) in nondiabetics and none in diabetics. In relation to donor age, AR was incidence 10.3% in patients with kidneys from donors aged 50 years or younger and 10.6% when donors were older than 50 years, including 1 (1.73%) and 2 (1.93%) steroid-resistant episodes, respectively. The graft and patient survival rates at 12 months were 90% and 98%, respectively.\nCONCLUSIONS: Simulect (basiliximab) used in routine clinical practice provided good prophylaxis against acute rejection in several kidney transplant patient populations, similar to that observed in randomized clinical studies with excellent tolerability and safety.",

We prospectively evaluated the safety and efficacy of a newly introduced cyclooxygenase 2 inhibitor in patients undergoing coronary artery bypass grafting surgery through a median sternotomy in a randomized clinical trial.\nMETHODS: A total of 462 patients with New York Heart Association classes I to III who were less than 77 years of age and were from 58 institutions in the United States, Canada, Germany, and the United Kingdom participated in this multicenter, phase III, placebo-controlled, double-blind, randomized, parallel-group trial. Patients were allocated at a ratio of 2:1 to parecoxib\/valdecoxib or standard care (control) groups, respectively. Intravenous study drug (40 mg) was administered within 30 minutes after extubation and every 12 hours for a minimum of 3 days. Subsequently, oral treatment at a dose of 40 mg every 12 hours was initiated and administered for a combined total of 14 days. Patient-controlled analgesia with morphine, oral opioids, or acetaminophen was available as required. Assessment of the analgesic efficacy of the study drug was primarily based on morphine and morphine equivalent use. Additional efficacy evaluations included daily pain intensity, patient and physician global evaluation of study medication, and pain effect on quality of life. Clinical adverse events were assessed by the principal investigator at each site from the time of the first dose through the 30-day postdosing period.\nRESULTS: Patients in the parecoxib\/valdecoxib group received significantly less morphine or morphine equivalents than patients in the control group during the 0- to 24-hour (P =.009), 24- to 48-hour (P =.017), 72- to 96-hour (P =.002), 96- to 120-hour (P =.004), and 120- to 144-hour (P =.037) periods. Both patients (P <.001) and physicians (P <.001) evaluated the study medication as significantly better than control therapy. The modified Brief Pain Inventory questionnaire used in the oral dosing period detected significant improvements in the parecoxib\/valdecoxib treatment group in 6 of 8 domains tested (eg, current pain, worst pain, and mood) beginning on day 4 and continuing for at least 4 days. Although there were no differences between the groups in overall adverse events, serious adverse events occurred twice as frequently in parecoxib\/valdecoxib-treated patients (19.0%, 59\/311 patients) than in control patients (9.9%, 15\/151 patients; P =.015). Regarding individual serious adverse events, a greater incidence in sternal wound infection was found in the parecoxib\/valdecoxib patients (10 [3.2%]) versus control patients (0 [0%]) (P =.035). The incidences of other individual serious adverse events, including cerebrovascular complications, myocardial infarction, and renal dysfunction, were proportionally greater but not significantly different between the groups.\nCONCLUSIONS: In patients undergoing coronary artery bypass grafting surgery, the cyclooxygenase 2 inhibitor combination, parecoxib\/valdecoxib, was effective for postoperative analgesia. However, the 14-day treatment regimen also was associated with an increased incidence of serious adverse events overall and sternal wound infections in particular. Therefore our study raises important concerns requiring their comprehensive evaluation in a large-scale trial before these cyclooxygenase 2 inhibitors are used in patients undergoing coronary artery bypass grafting surgery.",

        "Abstract":"Long-term follow-up of cardiac transplant recipients reveals a progressive decline in kidney function in a significant number of patients. This complication is one of the most important prognostic parameters for the outcome of cardiac transplantation. The risk factors implicated in the pathogenesis of renal dysfunction following cardiac transplantation are numerous, with the immunosuppressive drug cyclosporine (CsA) playing a major role. This case-control study was designed to evaluate the role of different risk factors among patients who had been transplanted at the Northern General Hospital Cardiothoracic Centre (CTC) with the possibility of identifying modifiable risk factors that mitigate the nephrotoxicity of CsA. Over a 10-year period, heart transplantation was performed in 205 patients at the CTC. Seventeen patients who experienced chronic renal failure (CRF) and were treated at the outpatient clinic of the Sheffield Kidney Institute were randomly selected from those who had >2-year graft survival and follow-up after cardiac transplantation. As controls, 15 cardiac transplant patients were randomly selected from 32 with comparable survival and follow-up after transplantation and without evidence of significant renal dysfunction (serum creatinine <\/=150 micromol\/L). The putative risk factors for development of renal insufficiency were retrospectively studied as well as those affecting the rate of progression of CRF. Seventy-five percent of the progressors (cases) had ischemic cardiomyopathy compared with 10% of nonprogressors (controls) (P <.05). CsA trough levels during the follow-up period were higher among the nonprogressors compared with the progressors (P =.03). Follow-up systolic blood pressure revealed a statistically significant correlation with the slope of serum creatinine in the progressor group (r = -.515 and P <.05). At the time of transplantation, ischemic cardiomyopathy as an underlying diagnosis seems to be a detrimental factor, contributing to the pathogenesis of renal dysfunction after heart transplantation. CsA trough levels alone do not seem to discriminate between progressors and nonprogressors. A randomized controlled study may be required to evaluate the possibility of replacing or reducing CsA to the lowest possible dose in the early posttransplant period for the subset of patients with ischemic cardiomyopathy.",

The compromised function of these organs makes it a priority to preserve their initial kidney function.\nHYPOTHESIS: Calcineurin-sparing protocols using anti-IL-2 receptor (IL-2R) antibody induction (Simulect) may benefit initial kidney function in these patients, as assessed by the rates of delayed graft function and of rejection during the first month after transplant.\nPATIENTS AND METHODS: A cohort of 15 consecutive elderly patients were prospectively compared with 30 cadaveric kidney transplants in younger recipients. Study patients were induced with Simulect (20 mg, 30 minutes before reperfusion and 4 days after transplantation) and steroids, delaying the introduction of CsA until the serum creatinine was below 3 mg\/dL. The other cohort of patients were immunosuppressed with tacrolimus (trough 8 to 12), mycophenolats mofetil (MMF, 1 g\/d), and an identical taper of steroids. The analysis compared donor and recipient ages, mean cold ischemic time, incidence of initial kidney function (diuresis in the first 24 h) serum creatinine levels, glomerular filtration rate (GFR), number of dialysis sessions, and rejection rate in the two groups.\nRESULTS: Except for the donor and recipient ages (72 vs 54 in donors, and 67 versus 52 years in recipients), no significant differences were observed between the groups among the rates of acute rejection (6.6% vs 13.2%), delayed graft function (13.2% required dialysis), or infection (6.6%). Within 1 month all 45 grafts showed primary function with equal creatinine levels (mean 1.65).\nCONCLUSIONS: Calcineurin-free protocols using IL-2 therapy as the initial suppression allow patients in the \"old to old\" ET program to display equal results to cadaveric kidney transplants with initial treatment with calcineurin antagonists.",

        "Abstract":"OBJECTIVE: Diabetes mellitus is a risk factor for death after coronary artery bypass grafting. Its relative risk may be related to the level of perioperative hyperglycemia. We hypothesized that strict glucose control with a continuous insulin infusion in the perioperative period would reduce hospital mortality.\nMETHODS: All patients with diabetes undergoing coronary artery bypass grafting (n = 3554) were treated aggressively with either subcutaneous insulin (1987-1991) or with continuous insulin infusion (1992-2001) for hyperglycemia. Predicted and observed hospital mortalities were compared with both internal and external (Society of Thoracic Surgeons 1996) multivariable risk models.\nRESULTS: Observed mortality with continuous insulin infusion (2.5%, n = 65\/2612) was significantly lower than with subcutaneous insulin (5.3%, n = 50\/942, P <.0001). Likewise, glucose control was significantly better with continuous insulin infusion (177 +\/- 30 mg\/dL vs 213 +\/- 41 mg\/dL, P <.0001). For internal comparison, multivariable analysis showed that continuous insulin infusion was independently protective against death (odds ratio 0.43, P =.001). Conversely, cardiogenic shock, renal failure, reoperation, nonelective operative status, older age, concomitant peripheral or cerebral vascular disease, decreasing ejection fraction, unstable angina, and history of atrial fibrillation increased the risk of death. For external comparison, observed mortality with continuous insulin infusion was significantly less than that predicted by the model (observed\/expected ratio 0.63, P <.001). Multivariable analysis revealed that continuous insulin infusion added an independently protective effect against death (odds ratio 0.50, P =.005) to the constellation of risk factors in the Society of Thoracic Surgeons risk model.\nCONCLUSION: Continuous insulin infusion eliminates the incremental increase in in-hospital mortality after coronary artery bypass grafting associated with diabetes. The protective effect of continuous insulin infusion may stem from the effective metabolic use of excess glucose to favorably alter pathways of myocardial adenosine triphosphate production. Continuous insulin infusion should become the standard of care for glycometabolic control in patients with diabetes undergoing coronary artery bypass grafting.",

Acute effects were as follows: At 1 hr, enalaprilat increased the cardiac index (p <.001), stroke volume index (p <.001), and right ventricular stroke work index (p <.03) compared with placebo, whereas mean arterial pressure (p <.008) and both systemic (p <.001) and pulmonary (p <.02) vascular resistance decreased. Continuous effects were as follows: Over 72 hrs, enalaprilat decreased diastolic pulmonary artery pressure (p <.019), pulmonary artery occlusion pressure (p <.02), and central venous pressure (p <.02). The cardiac and stroke volume indexes were consistently higher in the enalaprilat group, whereas systemic and pulmonary vascular resistances were lower. The arterial blood-pressure lowering effect was blunted and heart rate remained unchanged. Mixed venous oxygenation (p <.02) was higher and arterial oxygenation was not modified. Finally, enalaprilat increased creatinine clearance (p <.002) and decreased creatinine (p <.02) and urea (p <.03).\nCONCLUSIONS: Intravenous enalaprilat safely and effectively improves cardiac and renal function following coronary artery bypass surgery complicated by postoperative left ventricular dysfunction.",

Data were obtained from 30 recipients after cadaver or living related kidney transplantation. All patients (pts) were divided into two groups: Gr1 included 17 pts with biopsy evidence of CsA damage and Gr2 -13 pts without these changes. The mean age of recipients (38.6+\/-11.3 vs 34.6+\/-13.3), donor and recipient human leucocyte antigen (HLA) match (2.5\/6 vs 2.3\/6), cold ischemic time (12.0+\/- 9.3 h vs 13.8+\/-10.3 h), percentage of kidney from cadaver donors (64.7% vs 69.2%) were similar in both groups. Comparison of CsA blood levels (>200 ng\/ml) between Gr1 and Gr2 revealed statistically significant differences (70.6% vs 15.4%, p<0.05), correspondingly. The mean CsA blood level was higher in Gr1 (328.7+\/-153.8 ng\/ml vs 202.4+\/-145.6 ng\/ml, p<0.03). Thus, we suggest that CsA nephrotoxicity is associated with elevated CsA levels of more than 200 ng\/ml.

All patients received oral anticoagulation to maintain the international normalized ratio at 3.0 to 4.0. Clinical follow-up and duplex ultrasound examinations were performed at 3-month intervals up to 1 year.\nRESULTS: Thrombolysis was technically successful in 27 (84%) patients; 3 of the 5 failed patients had amputations.

In 18 patients, underlying stenoses (11 distal anastomosis, 5 proximal anastomosis, and 3 inflow) were treated, 15 by an endovascular procedure and 3 surgically. Four major complications occurred: groin hematoma, sepsis, transient renal dysfunction, and a hemorrhage at the proximal anastomosis after urokinase treatment. At 1 year, 21 bypass grafts had reoccluded (20% patency rate on intention-to-treat basis); 3 reocclusions resulted in amputation (overall 19% amputation rate).\nCONCLUSIONS: Thrombolysis in the setting of acute lower limb bypass graft occlusion is associated with good initial technical success rates and satisfactory clinical results.

We treated a select group of patients at especially high risk for restenosis with oral sirolimus.\nMETHODS AND RESULTS: Patients were treated with an oral sirolimus-loading dose of 6 mg after coronary angioplasty, followed by 2 mg\/d for 4 weeks. Serum electrolytes, lipid profile, renal panel, and complete blood cell count were measured at 1, 3, and 5 weeks after drug initiation. Oral sirolimus was prescribed to 22 patients who had a total of 28 lesions and were at high risk for restenosis. Of the 22 study patients, 11 (50%) discontinued oral sirolimus early because of side effects or laboratory abnormalities. Hypertriglyceridemia and leukopenia were the most frequent adverse events, occurring in 3 patients each. All adverse drug effects were reversible after discontinuation. Follow-up was obtained in 100% of patients at a mean of 9.9+\/-1.8 months, ranging from 6.5 to 11.8 months. Target lesion revascularization (TLR) occurred in 15 of 28 lesions (53.6%) and 13 of 22 patients (59.1%).

        "Abstract":"Unfractionated heparin (UH) and low-molecular-weight heparins (LMWH) are antithrombotic drugs covering virtually all indications requiring immediately effective anticoagulation. For prevention and treatment of venous thromboembolism (VTE) UH have mainly been replaced by LMWH due to their practical usefulness (one or two subcutaneous daily doses without laboratory test for dose adjustment) and their more favourable risk-benefit profile. With respect to arterial occlusions this statement is also valid for unstable angina pectoris. The risk to develop heparin-induced thrombocytopenia (HIT) appears to be ten times lower with LMWH. In hospitals the use of UH is reserved for complex cases with high bleeding risk and the necessity to interrupt heparin effects rapidly. Therapeutic doses of UH are monitored by the classical coagulation assays, activated partial thromboplastin time (aPTT) and thrombin time (TT), but also by automated chromogenic tests of anti-factor Xa activity. There are no prospective studies directly comparing the efficiency of these three approaches. Disagreements between tests are not rare in individual cases. However, dosing recommendations for UH treatment of VTE (intravenous bolus of 80 IU\/kg, followed by 18 IU\/kg\/h infusion) and average doses used are concordant. 0.30-0.70 anti-Xa IU\/ml are considered as therapeutic range for UF infusion. Higher UH activities required during extracorporeal circulation in heart surgery or during coronary angioplasty are usually guided by bedside ACT (activated clotting time). For LMWH tests of anti-Xa activities may only be necessary during weight adjusted treatment of pregnant women, children, or cases with reduced kidney function (glomerular filtration rate < 30 ml\/min.) or increased bleeding risk. Expected anti-Xa activities are 0.5-1.1 IU\/ml and 1.0-2.0 IU\/ml 4 hours after subcutaneous LMWH for dosing intervals of 12 hours and 24 hours respectively.",

There are limited data comparing different agents.\nOBJECTIVE: The purpose of this study was to compare in-hospital and 30-day outcomes in 2 sequential cohorts of consecutive patients undergoing PCI at our institution who received abciximab or eptifibatide.\nMETHODS: The first cohort included patients who received abciximab between September 1, 1998, and January 9, 1999, and the second included patients who were treated with eptifibatide between January 11 and April 27, 1999. Per formulary decision, during the latter period, patients with renal insufficiency continued to be treated with abciximab and were ineligible for therapy with eptifibatide. Major adverse cardiac events (MACEs) were evaluated by one or more of the authors and compared.\nRESULTS: A total of 319 patients were treated with abciximab and 301 with eptifibatide. There were no differences in baseline characteristics between the 2 groups, with the exception of a significantly higher proportion of patients with chronic renal insufficiency in the abciximab-treated group (4% vs 0% with eptifibatide; P = 0.03) The majority of interventions were performed for an acute coronary syndrome. Procedural success was 97% in both groups. Eptifibatide patients were treated for a mean 20.4 (5.2) hours, with 10.1% receiving the drug before the procedure. There were no differences in overall or individual MACEs in hospital or at 30 days.\nCONCLUSION: Our data suggest similar in-hospital and 30-day outcomes for abciximab- and eptifibatide-treated patients undergoing PCI.",

        "Abstract":"The authors report 2 cases of patients who underwent cadaveric renal transplantation from the same donor in a multiorgan extraction procedure. Both cases showed, during the first 6 months posttransplantation, a worsening in renal graft function and signs of ischemia in the homolateral lower limb. One of the cases was preceded by pain in the sciatic region. In imaging tests, a pseudoaneurysm was detected in the iliac artery in both patients. Grafts had to be removed, and the iliac arteries were ligated with posterior isolation of Aspergillus spp from the arterial vessels but not from the renal tissue. Besides surgery, medical treatment with liposomal amphotericin B was initiated with a different outcome in each patient: patient A died, whereas patient B recovered. The absence of Aspergillus spp infection in liver and heart recipients ruled out a donor-transmitted infection. The graft placements were carried out in different operating rooms, which rules out contamination during the transplantation process. All of this leads us to conclude that the infection must have occurred during the preservation phase of the kidney.",

        "Abstract":"Patients with malignancy often present with a variety of coagulation abnormalities which may ultimately lead to recurrent arterial and venous thromboses. Recently the presence of antiphospholipid antibodies in cancer patients has been proposed as one of the potential mechanisms promoting hypercoagulability. Here we report two consecutive patients with localized tumors, one suffering from breast cancer and another presenting with colorectal cancer, who experienced dramatic exacerbation of the antiphospholipid antibody syndrome (APAS) within 4 weeks after surgery. In the first patient who had also received one course of adjuvant chemotherapy, major ischemic stroke and recurrent venous thromboembolism were paralleled by the development of ulcerative livedoid vasculitis and pancytopenia, constituting the diagnosis of systemic lupus erythematosus with secondary APAS. In the second patient, progressive thrombotic occlusion of the superior and inferior vena cava was associated with bilateral pulmonary embolism, acute renal failure, and disabling soft tissue edema. Although not fulfilling the classic criteria of \"catastrophic\" APAS, the clinical features were life threatening and appeared to be refractory to oral anticoagulation with phenprocoumon. In addition, a diagnosis of Trousseau's syndrome was unlikely due to missing evidence of gross metastatic disease. Besides a suggested treatment strategy comprising high doses of low-molecular-weight heparin, potential pathogenic mechanisms are discussed in consideration of a recently proposed \"thrombotic storm,\" which may cause multiple thromboses after an initial provocation in patients with known hypercoagulability.",

        "Abstract":"BACKGROUND: The achievement and maintenance of access sites for hemodialysis is a persistent challenge for both the vascular surgeon and the clinical nephrologist. The advent of improved interventional, endovascular, and pharmacomechanical techniques for the treatment of thrombosis has raised questions as to whether surgical thrombectomy is the most effective treatment.\nOBJECTIVE: The purpose of this study was to determine the role of surgical thrombectomy as the standard of care for the patient with end-stage renal disease and a thrombosed\/stenosed arteriovenous graft (AVG).\nDESIGN AND METHODS: The study was designed as a metaanalysis. All publications that directly or indirectly described randomized controlled trials for the treatment of thrombosed dialysis grafts in patients with end-stage renal disease and AVG were searched. Relative risk (RR) and risk difference were used as the measure of effect for each dichotomous outcome. All of the studies that met the inclusion criteria were limited to prosthetic AVGs.\nRESULTS: The overall results suggested a clear superiority of surgery over endovascular procedures at 30 days, 60 days, 90 days, and 1 year. The RRs (95% CI) at these time points were 1.32 (1.07, 1.60), 1.34 (1.13, 1.58), 1.22 (1.05, 1.40), and 1.22 (1.07, 140), respectively, and favored surgery in all cases (30 days, P =.010; 60 days, P =.0007; 90 days, P =.007; and 1 year P =.003). The number needed to treat to prevent one endovascular occlusion after thrombectomy was 8 at 30 days, 6 at 60 days, 8 at 90 days, and 7 at 1 year. The rates of technical failure were significantly greater in the endovascular group compared with the surgical group (RR, 1.90; 95% CI, 1.32, 2.73; P =.0005), which generated an absolute risk reduction of 16% (P =.0002). No significant difference was seen in the complication rates between the two groups.\nCONCLUSION: The analysis of all currently available randomized controlled trials clearly supports the use of surgical thrombectomy for the treatment of thrombosed prosthetic vascular access grafts. The use of endovascular techniques has been found to be inferior to surgery in terms of both primary patency and technical failure rates.",

The advantage of a topical aprotinin application is seen in the fact that this may not lead to systemic side effects. A prospective, randomized study comprising 97 patients was conducted. A dose of 5 x 10(6) KIU aprotinin was given systemically to 49 patients and four doses of 1.25 x 10(6) KIU aprotinin were applied topically to 48 patients by spraying the substance on the target area (A. mammaria interna region and pericardium). We determined markers for the inflammatory response, coagulation system, standard haematological markers and postoperative complications. Exclusion criteria were defined as surgical bleeding, redo operations, neurological, haematological, liver and kidney disorders. Sex, age, perfusion times, mortality, renal failure and strokes were identical in both groups. Biochemical markers and clinical outcome demonstrated no significant differences between the systemic and local applications. Interleukin 6 and elastase were tendentially higher (p = 0.1) in the local group, but with a high standard deviation in each patient. Our results suggest that there is no difference between the perioperative application of 5 x 10(6) KIU systemically given aprotinin and 1.25 x 10(6) KIU locally applied aprotinin.",

        "Abstract":"Regression of left ventricular hypertrophy in hemodialysis patients is possible. Left ventricular hypertrophy represents the major risk factor for cardiac morbidity and mortality. Therefore, their regression is mandatory. Since the causes of uremia-associated left ventricular hypertrophy are multifactorial, various therapeutic options can be considered: optimal control of arterial hypertension and volume status, optimal correction of metabolic acidosis, best possible correction of hypoalbuminemia and severe secondary hyperparathyroidism, modern pharmacotherapeutic strategy for the treatment of heart failure (use of angiotensin-converting enzyme inhibitors in combination with angiotensin II receptor blockers and beta-blockers) and total correction of renal anemia. Following the proposed therapeutic strategies we could, by using echocardiography, distinguish in 100 hemodialysis patients the following 3 groups (on the average after 1.5 years): 36 patients with initially normal left ventricular mass index (LVMI (g\/m2), F < 110; M < 130) maintained normal (group 1); in 31 patients with moderately increased LVMI full regression resulted (group 2); 33 patients with severely increased LVMI (group 3) had to be further divided into 2 sub-groups: 22 patients with significant improvement of LVMI, 11 patients with no, regression. For the first time we were able to show that it is possible to maintain initially normal LVMI during long-term treatment and to achieve complete regression and significant improvement of LVMI in our patients. However, since LVMI requires a long time to develop, a similarly long time must be estimated for its regression. However, 11 patients remained therapeutically resistant. In this group, severe heart diseases were often combined and highly prevalent, including ischemic heart and valve diseases and end-stage dilatative cardiomyopathy. These patients had to be transferred to cardiac surgery. Anemia is considered to be one of the most important factors for the development of left ventricular hypertrophy. Therefore, total correction of renal anemia has to be strongly recommended in addition to other measures of our therapeutic strategy to maintain full or significant regression of left ventricular hypertrophy.",

One hundred recipients of first-kidney transplant were enrolled into the study to receive either anti-IL-2R monoclonal antibody, daclizumab (2 mg\/kg intraoperatively, limited anti-IL-2R) or no induction (control). Each patient also received oral tacrolimus (dosed to target trough level 10-15 ng\/mL), MMF (500 mg bid) and prednisone. The primary efficacy end-point was the incidence of biopsy proven acute rejection during the first 6 months post-transplant. The patients were also followed for 12-month graft function, and graft and patient survival rates. Other than the donor's age being significantly lower in the control group, both groups were comparable with respect to age, weight, gender, race, human leukocyte antigen (HLA)-DR mismatch, panel reactive antibody (%PRA), cold ischemic time, cytomegalovirus (CMV) status, causes of renal failure, and duration and modes of renal replacement therapy (RRT). During the first 6 months, episodes of first biopsy confirmed acute rejection was 3\/50 (6%) in the limited anti-IL-2R group and 8\/50 (16%) in the controls (p < 0.05). Twelve-month patient 100\/98 (%) and graft survival 100\/96 (%) were not statistically different. The group receiving limited anti-IL-2R did not have any adverse reactions. Our study demonstrates that a limited (single) 2 mg\/kg immunoprophylaxis dose with monoclonal IL-2R antibody (daclizumab) when combined with tacrolimus\/MMF\/steroid allows significant reduction in early renal allograft rejection to the single digit level. The therapy with anti-IL-2R antibody is simple and is well tolerated.",

Subjects with post-transplant diabetes mellitus were excluded from the comparative analysis. Distribution of sex, source of donors and mode of immunosuppression were similar in pre-TDM and ND groups.\nRESULTS: Fifty-three (67%) recipients in pre-TDM and 90 (20.5%) in the ND group (p < 0.01) were above 45 years of age. However, 26 (33.3%) pre-TDM and 345 (79.5%) ND were below age 45. Among those who died, coronary artery disease led to death in 36% of pre-TDM and 27% in ND. Hyperlipidemia requiring drug therapy was observed in 37% pre-TDM and 6% ND. The incidence of severe infections was nearly twice in pre-TDM over ND recipients (1.9 vs. 1.0 per patient, p < 0.001). Acute rejection episodes were more frequently seen in pre-TDM (43%) than ND (33%), however the difference was not statistically significant.

The major contributory factors were severe infections and coronary artery disease. The cumulative graft survival showed a similar pattern (52% in pre-TDM, 73% in ND at 10 years). However, when death is excluded, the 10-year pure graft survival probability was similar for the pre-TDM and ND groups (76% vs. 80%).\nCONCLUSION: Our study indicates poor patient survival in pre-TDM due to coronary artery disease and infections, whereas the pure long-term graft survival was equally good in pre-TDM and ND transplant recipients.",

        "Abstract":"BACKGROUND: Triflusal is an irreversible inhibitor of platelet cyclooxygenase. Triflusal significantly reduced the incidence of nonfatal myocardial infarction in patients with unstable angina. Antithrombotic properties have also been demonstrated in patients with aortocoronary vein grafting, coronary angioplasty, peripheral arteriopathy and cerebrovascular disease. Moreover, in diabetic patients it has a protective effect against retinal microangiopathy, improves renal flow and reduces proteinuria. The drug has a high tolerability and has low incidence of side effects, with prevalence of gastrointestinal and skin disorders. Because of its demonstrated effectiveness and its good handling, we decided to use Triflusal in treatment of geriatric patients with peripheral arteriopathy. Often these patients have a diffused arteriopathic disease which can be associated with chronic diseases. For this reason there are severe problems of compliance due to contemporary administration of several drugs; so the utilization of effective drugs, without side effects, promotes a safer clinical management of patients.\nMETHODS: Between April 2000 and March 2001, we treated with Triflusal 70 patients, over 65 years old, with peripheral arteriopathy. The group comprises patients who had undergone traditional vascular surgery, or endovascular surgery and patients treated exclusively with drug therapy. During the follow-up we obser-ved the possible clinical development of side effects of the drug reported in the literature (nausea, vomiting, etc.).\nRESULTS: One patient, already affected by gastroduodenal disease, suspended the therapy because of severe epigastric burning.\nCONCLUSIONS: The follow-up of the patients goes on in order to evaluate the tolerability and handling of Triflusal, observing a larger number of patients.",

        "Abstract":"BACKGROUND: These studies were conducted to determine whether bivalirudin clearance and pharmacodynamics are dependent on dose, renal function, or gender.\nMETHODS: Two studies were performed. The first comprised 25 patients who were undergoing percutaneous coronary intervention-8 with normal renal function, 11 with mild renal impairment, and 6 with moderate renal impairment. Each patient received a bolus dose of bivalirudin (1 mg\/kg) followed by an infusion (2.5 mg\/kg per hour for 4 of 6 hours, then 0.5 mg\/kg per hour for 4 of 6 hours). The second study enrolled 8 volunteers with severe renal impairment who received a bivalirudin bolus of 1 mg\/kg, followed by an infusion of 0.5 mg\/kg per hour for 10 hours. Bivalirudin in plasma and urine was assayed with a newly developed, highly specific liquid chromatography-mass spectrometry assay.\nRESULTS: Clearances at the two infusion doses did not differ significantly (3.23 mL\/min per kilogram and 3.16 mL\/min per kilogram). There was no statistically significant difference in area under the concentration-time curve (AUC) and in plasma clearance between patients with normal renal function and those with mild renal impairment. Patients with moderate and severe renal impairment had reductions in plasma clearance of 21% and 24%, respectively. The level of anticoagulation(activated clotting time) was similar between groups. There was no difference between male and female patients.\nCONCLUSION: The clearance of bivalirudin is dependent on renal function but independent of dose and gender. Approximately 20% of unchanged drug is cleared via the kidney, and the remainder presumably undergoes proteolysis intracellularly. The pharmacodynamics of bivalirudin are dose-dependent and gender-independent. Bivalirudin kinetics are linear in the dose ranges that are used in percutaneous coronary intervention and that are under investigation for use in acute coronary syndromes.",

A 69-year-old male presented with acute type B aortic dissection with proximal extension complicated by severe renovascular hypertension secondary to left renal ischemia. Endovascular management consisted of imaging with intravascular ultrasound and left renal artery stenting with balloon-expandable stents. His hypertension subsequently resolved and he was discharged on his baseline two-drug regimen. Management of the ischemic complications of type B aortic dissections may be primarily approached using endovascular methods in stable patients, with open surgery reserved for those patients refractory to these methods. Patients with evidence of decreased renal perfusion represent a select group with an increased risk of associated morbidity and mortality and should therefore be aggressively managed. Accurate information and assessment of anatomy can be obtained with intravascular ultrasound and is therefore an important adjunct to the armamentarium of endovascular specialists managing complications of aortic dissection.",

During a 15-year period (January 1983-January 1998), 631 renal transplant recipients (TxR) were followed-up in our Centre of whom 79 (12.5%) had pre-transplant diabetes mellitus. Among the 552 TxR who were non-diabetic at pre-transplantation, 117 (21.2%) developed PTDM. The gender, native renal disease and the mode of pre-transplant dialysis did not differ in those with and without PTDM. Of the 117 TxR who developed PTDM, 63 (53.8%) were above the age of 45 years where as only 90 (20.7%) of the 435 who remained non-diabetic (NDM) were above this age (P<0.05). PTDM occurred in 115 (29.6%) recipients of Arab origin (Kuwaitis and non-Kuwaitis) where as only two (1.7%) non-Arabs developed it. There was no difference in the incidence of PTDM when prednisone and azathioprine (two drug regime) were used or with cyclosporine (triple drug regime). The incidence of acute rejection episodes did not differ among PTDM and NDM groups. The over all incidence of infections requiring hospitalisation was higher in PTDM group (1.8 episodes per patient) compared to NDM group (one episode per patient) during the study period (P<0.001). Coronary heart disease was also more frequent in PTDM (15 vs. 6%, P<0.05). The cumulative graft survival at 1, 5, 10 and 14 years in the PTDM (97, 92, 74 and 67%, respectively) and NDM groups (97, 91, 80 and 73%, respectively) was similar. However, an important cause of graft loss was death of the recipient in PTDM compared to NDM (10.7 vs. 3.6%). Similarly, the patient survival up to 14 years did not differ between PTDM and NDM groups (80 and 82%, respectively), although infection related deaths were more frequent in the PTDM group (65 vs. 49%) although not statistically significant. In conclusion, there is a high incidence of PTDM in Kuwait; age and race being the two important contributory factors. The overall patient and graft survival are not adversely affected by PTDM although infections and coronary heart disease are more frequently encountered in this group.",

        "Abstract":"BACKGROUND: This prospective, randomized study assessed the effect of dopamine on renal tubular function in patients who had coronary artery bypass grafting.\nMETHODS: Two groups of patients with normal preoperative renal function were randomly divided into a dopamine group (n=11), who received dopamine in a dose of 2 mg\/kg x min, and a control group (n=11), who received no treatment. Dopamine infusion was initiated 24 hours before the operation and was continued for 48 hours postoperatively. Measurements of renal function obtained 2 days before the operation were considered preoperative and were repeated on the 1st, 3rd, and 7th postoperative days. Urinary excretion of b2-Microglobulin (b2-M), considered a sensitive means for diagnosing proximal tubular damage, was measured during the early (day 3) and late (day 7) postoperative period.\nRESULTS: There were no significant differences respect to the clearances of creatinine, osmotic, and free-water in the dopamine group compared with the control group (p>0.05). Urine microalbumin levels significantly increased on postoperative day 3 in both groups. During the early postoperative period, excretion of urine b2-M was significantly greater in the dopamine group than in the control group (p<0.05).\nCONCLUSIONS: Consequently, in patients with normal preoperative renal and cardiac function scheduled for elective coronary artery bypass grafting, renal dose dopamine infusion alone may not provide sufficient protection on tubular function and increases renal tubular injury during the early postoperative period.",

        "Abstract":"A case report on the nephrotoxic effect of cyclosporine in a 9-year-old boy with a kidney transplant is presented. Nephrotoxicity was present even at low trough cyclosporine concentration. The literature on the range of cyclosporine nephrotoxicity is reviewed. Cyclosporine (CsA), a fungal decapeptide first introduced in 1983, has significantly improved the outcome of renal transplantation, and remains the first line immunosupressant for pediatric recipients. CsA has a narrow therapeutic range because of the fine line between adequate immunosuppression and the risk of drug-induced side effects. Furthermore, considerable inter- and intrapatient variability does exist [Filler et al. 1999]. The pre-dose trough concentration is routinely used for therapeutic drug monitoring [Bunchman et al. 1998]. The most significant side effect is nephrotoxicity, which may present differently at different times after transplantation. Renal vasoconstriction, especially involving the afferent renal arterioles, has been strongly implicated as a primary factor in acute reversible CsA nephrotoxicity. Alpha-adrenergic and calcium channel blockade with either verapamil or nifedipine ameliorates vasospasm and impairment of renal function that accompany CsA toxicity. Because of this vasoconstrictive effect, CsA may increase ischemic graft damage in the early posttransplant period. CsA side effects can be eliminated by reducing the dosage of the drug. We present an unusual case of nephrotoxicity and impaired renal function with a very low CsA blood trough concentration (50 ng\/ml) on posttransplant treatment. The side effects subsided only after the discontinuation of CsA.",

In this double-blind, prospective, randomised study, we investigated the effect of dopamine infusion (2.5 microg\/kg\/min) on glomerular filtration rate (GFR) and tubular injury in patients undergoing routine cardiopulmonary bypass (CPB).\nMETHODS: Forty eight patients were randomly assigned to receive intravenous dopamine or saline from induction of anaesthesia until 48 hours post-operatively. There were no differences in mean age, bypass time or pre-op creatinine in the 36 patients (33 men) who completed the study. 51Cr-EDTA GFR (ml\/min\/1.73 m2) was measured pre-operatively and on day 5 only. Urinary markers of tubular injury (albumin, N-acetyl glucosaminidase, NAG; retinol binding protein, RBP) were measured pre-operatively, and on days 1, 2 and 5.\nRESULTS: GFR was preserved equally in both groups. All patients demonstrated significant tubular injury but urinary levels of NAG and RBP were lower in the dopamine group (41%, p=0.057 and 41%, p=0.007, respectively) on the first post-operative day.\nCONCLUSION: We conclude that low dose dopamine infusion may reduce renal tubular injury following CPB in patients with normal or near normal baseline renal function.",

We administered a maximum total dose of 8 U of reteplase intra-arterially in 1-U increments via superselective catheterization. Adjunctive angioplasty of the occluded artery was performed in seven patients. Angiographic evidence of perfusion and thrombus was graded by use of modified Thrombolysis in Myocardial Infarction (TIMI) criteria. Neurological examinations were performed before and 24 hours and 7 to 10 days after treatment.\nRESULTS: Sixteen consecutive patients were treated (mean age, 64.1 +\/- 16.4 yr; seven were men). Initial National Institutes of Health Stroke Scale scores ranged from 10 to 26. Time from onset of symptoms to treatment ranged from 2 to 9 hours. Occlusion sites were the cervical internal carotid artery (n = 4), intracranial internal carotid artery (n = 4), middle cerebral artery (n = 6), and vertebrobasilar artery (n = 2). Complete or near-complete perfusion (TIMI Grade 3 or 4) was achieved in the arteries in 14 patients (88%), with partial recanalization (TIMI Grade 2) or minimal response (TIMI Grade 1) in the arteries in one patient each. Neurological improvement (defined as decrease of four or more points in National Institutes of Health Stroke Scale score) was observed in 7 (44%) of the 16 patients at 24 hours. Symptomatic intracerebral hemorrhage occurred in one patient; three other patients experienced intracerebral hemorrhages that did not result in neurological worsening. The overall mortality during hospitalization was 56%, related to massive ischemic stroke (n = 7), withdrawal of care at the family's request after the development of aspiration pneumonia and renal failure (n = 1), and a combination of intracerebral hemorrhage and massive ischemic stroke (n = 1).\nCONCLUSION: In this study, intra-arterially administered reteplase in doses up to 8 U with or without angioplasty resulted in a high rate of recanalization.

        "Abstract":"INTRODUCTION: Intra-arterial thrombolysis is commonly used as the initial treatment of acute or subacute lower extremity ischemia.\nMETHODS: To evaluate the efficacy and cost of thrombolysis, we retrospectively analyzed 100 consecutive cases (87 patients) in which intra-arterial lysis (urokinase) was used as the initial treatment for native arterial lower extremity occlusive disease. The mean age of patients was 67 years, 57% of the patients were male, and preexisting peripheral vascular disease was present in 74%. Presenting symptoms were limb-threatening ischemia (53%) and claudication (47%). Acute symptoms (< 2 weeks' duration) were present in 48%.\nRESULTS: The 30-day morbidity rate was 31%, and four patients died. Complications were significant bleeding (23%), ischemic stroke (1%), and renal failure with (2%) and without (2%) dialysis. Concomitant angioplasty was performed in 63%. Complete or significant lysis as demonstrated with angiography was achieved in 75% of iliac, 58% of femoropopliteal, and 41% of crural vessels (P <.001). Within 30 days of lysis, 9% of patients underwent major amputation and 20% surgical revascularization (in 3 patients the extent of revascularization was lessened by the lytic therapy). Amputation-free survival was 83% and 75% at 6 months and 2 years, respectively. Relief of ischemia (defined as relief of claudication or limb salvage without major surgical intervention) was achieved in only 70% and 43% of patients at 30 days and 2 years, respectively (Kaplan-Meier analysis; mean follow-up, 31 months). Patients with aortoiliac disease had significantly better outcomes than those with infrainguinal disease (P =.03). Duration or type of presenting symptoms did not predict outcome. The cost of the initial hospitalization per patient for thrombolysis was $18,490.\nCONCLUSION: Thrombolysis can be as or more costly than surgery and is associated with a suboptimal outcome in a significant number of patients. These data lead us to caution against a uniform policy of initial thrombolysis for patients who present with lower extremity ischemia.",

The goals for treating patients with RAS are to reduce cardiovascular morbidity and mortality attributable to elevated arterial pressure and to preserve renal function beyond critical stenosis. Recent, randomized trials with current antihypertensive agents indicate that many patients with RAS can be managed for years without renal artery revascularization. As it does elsewhere, atherosclerotic disease can progress to more severe occlusion in the renal arteries. Rapid advances in endovascular techniques, including stenting, make restoration of renal blood flow possible in more patients than before. Therapeutic goals are achieved by 1) avoidance of tobacco, 2) reducing arterial pressure with antihypertensive drug therapy, particularly those agents capable of blocking the renin-angiotensin system, and 3) renal revascularization, using balloon angioplasty and stent placement, surgical bypass, or endarterectomy. The major clinical challenges are to identify progressive occlusive disease and to determine appropriate timing for vascular intervention.",

Twenty-six of them were over 65 (mean 69+\/-4, range 65 to 81), but 10 were over 70 years of age. The survival rate was compared with 45 transplants from younger donors (mean age 51+\/-6, range 24 to 59).

These were compared with 153 patients in a tube (T) group, 268 patients in a bifurcated endograft (BI) group, and 111 patients in an open control (C) group. All data were audited and independently analyzed for presentation to the Food and Drug Administration.\nRESULTS: Group demographics were similar with the following exceptions. Aneurysm diameter was significantly less in the T group (51.2 mm) but similar for the A-I (57 mm), BI (54.6 mm), and C (55.6 mm) groups (P < .001). There were more male patients in all endograft groups (A-I 92.6%, BI 89.5%, T 85.6% vs 76.6% for C, P = .002). Peripheral arterial occlusion was present more frequently in the A-I group (25.6% vs 13.8% BI, 10.5% T, and 10.8% C, P = .003). However, no differences were found in mean age, incidence of coronary artery disease, and American Society of Anesthesiologists III\/IV classification. Implantation was achieved in 94.2% of the A-I group, 90.3% of the BI group, and 92% of the T group. No significant difference was seen in the operative mortality rate (4.2% A-I, 2.6% BI, O% T, 2.7% C). Postoperative cardiac complications were similar for the A-I (22%) and C (20.7%) groups but significantly less for the BI and T groups (13.4% and 10.5%, P = .019), whereas pulmonary problems were significantly reduced in all endograft groups (A-I 11.9%, BI 10.1%, and T 7.2% vs 22.5% for C, P = .002). Transient renal dysfunction occurred in 6.8% of the A-I group and 8.2% of the BI group but in only 3.3% of the T group and 1.8% of the C group (P = .028). Operating time was significantly longer for the A-I group than for the BI, T, or C groups (258 minutes vs 156, 179, and 174 minutes). Median blood loss, intensive care unit use, and hospital stays were markedly and significantly reduced in all endograft groups compared with the control group. The incidences of type I endoleak at 1 year were 2.4% A-I, 2.3% BI, and 3.8% T, and no ruptures occurred in any of the patients treated with endografts. No femoral-femoral graft thromboses occurred in the A-I group.\nCONCLUSION: Despite the fact that patients with combined aortic and iliac aneurysms have a more complex repair requirement and have an increased rate of comorbidity, the results are competitive with endovascular repair of aortic aneurysm by tube and bifurcated graft systems and are associated with a lower morbidity than open operation.",

The purpose of the present phase II study is to evaluate the antitumour efficacy and toxicity of the combination of docetaxel and cisplatin in patients with recurrent or disseminated squamous-cell carcinoma of the head and neck (SCCHN) for whom no curative therapy is available.\nPATIENTS AND METHODS: Eligibility criteria included: written informed consent; WHO performance status < or = 2; age 18-70 years; adequate bone marrow, liver, and renal function; measurable or evaluable disease; no previous systemic chemotherapy (prior radiotherapy and\/or surgery were allowed), no other previous or concurrent malignancy; no peripheral neuropathy. Treatment consisted of docetaxel 75 mg\/m2 in a one-hour infusion after pre-treatment with prednisolone, followed by cisplatin 75 mg\/m2 in a half-hour infusion preceded and followed by hydration. Treatment was repeated every three weeks for a maximum of eight cycles.\nRESULTS: Twenty-five patients (median age 52 years, range 33-66) entered the trial, all were evaluable for survival, twenty-four for response and toxicity. Twenty-four patients had undergone prior radiotherapy and seventeen had also had surgery. Nineteen had local-regional recurrence only, three had local-regional disease and distant metastases, and three had distant metastases only. Patients received a median of 5 treatment cycles (range 2-8). Overall response rate was 33% (8 of 24) of patients; complete response rate was 8% (2 of 24) of patients, lasting 2.2 and 17.1 months, respectively; partial response rate was 25% (6 of 24) of patients, lasting for a median of 4.9 months (range 1.7-11.6 months). Median survival was 11 months. Toxicity was relatively well tolerated. However, one patient died of probable toxicity (neutropenia and infection) and three patients discontinued treatment because of toxicity (massive oedema, myocardial infarction, persistent thrombocytopenia). The most frequent moderate-to-severe toxicity (75% of patients) was grade 3-4 neutropenia, transient in all but one patient. Grade 3 neuropathy occurred in one patient, none had grade 4. Grade 3 oral mucositis occurred in three patients, none had grade 4. Grade 2-3 hypomagnesaemia occurred in 10 patients requiring magnesium infusion.\nCONCLUSIONS: Docetaxel and cisplatin is an active combination in patients with recurrent or disseminated SCCHN.

There were 103 males and 27 females (age: 61.3+\/-11.5 years). Indications were squamous cell carcinoma in 69 patients and adenocarcinoma in 61. Preoperatively 30 patients (eight in stage IIB, 18 in stage III, and four in stage IV) received radiochemotherapy.

The initial platelet count was 99,000\/microliter. Continuous haemofiltration (CVVH) was started three days later. Thrombotic obstructions of haemodialysis filters and catheters occurred frequently and heparin-induced thrombocytopenia (HIT II) was suspected. Antibodies against heparin were found in the HIPA test. Despite heparin free citrate dialysis and anticoagulation with danaparoid thrombotic obstructions of filters and catheters continued. Therefore the anticoagulation therapy during CVVH was changed to recombinant hirudin (lepirudin). Starting dose was a bolus of 0.01 mg\/kg bw followed by the same amount as maintenance dose per hour. Anticoagulation was adjusted to an increase of aPTT (activated partial thromboplastin time) to 1.5-2 times its normal value. A dose of 0.005 mg\/kg bw\/h lepirudin was sufficient to maintain adequate anticoagulation. After changing to lepirudin no further catheter obstructions were observed and the platelets recovered slowly. Renal function improved and five weeks after admission endogenous creatinine clearance showed a value of 25 ml\/min. We conclude that lepirudin is an effective anticoagulant during CVVH in patients with HIT II. In partly permeable polysulfon filters a dose of 0.005 mg\/kg bw\/h lepirudin is sufficient to maintain adequate anticoagulation. Monitoring anticoagulation by measuring the increase of aPTT (factor 1.5-2.0) seems to be safe. However, optimally the r-hirudin concentration should be measured directly using the Ecarin clotting time.",

        "Abstract":"Ischemic nephropathy refers to the kidney damage following stenosis or an obstructive lesion in the main kidney arteries. This disorder has been overlooked in the past and a more rational and specific use of clinical criteria, and the development of not very invasive techniques with a good diagnostic accuracy such as spiral CT angiography, NMR angiography and echo-colour-Doppler have improved our ability to identify these patients. It is therefore likely that, in the next few years, we will find ourselves treating an increasing number of patients with renovascular ischemic disorders. Transluminal angioplasty and, more recently, the use of endovascular stents, have led to a marked improvement in the treatment of stenoses and, together with vascular surgery, allow to treat almost all patients with this disorder. There is, however, a lack of prospective and controlled studies, which demonstrate the long term benefit of revascularization treatment, as compared with optimum conservative treatment in reducing cardiovascular mortality, cardiovascular events and preserving renal function. The Ischemic Nephropathy Study Group of the Italian Society of Nephrology has organized a prospective, controlled study over a period of three years, aimed at comparing the effect of revascularization versus medical therapy in 300 patients with renal artery stenosis, ranging between 50 and 90 per cent, who will be randomly assigned to the two treatments. End point will be cardiovascular mortality and morbidity and need for renal replacement therapy.",

In 11 patients, a balanced mixed amino acid infusion was infused (200 mL\/hr) for 30 minutes immediately after the operation.\nMEASUREMENTS AND MAIN RESULTS: RBF and glomerular filtration rate increased during amino acid infusion compared with the control group. Renal oxygen consumption increased in the amino acid group and correlated with the increase in RBF (r = 0.70, p<0.001). Amino acid infusion induced two- to fourfold increases in plasma concentrations of individual amino acid concentrations and promoted renal extraction of aspartate, glutamate, glycine, and histidine. No correlation was observed between arterial concentration or uptake of individual amino acids and RBF.\nCONCLUSIONS: The increase in RBF from a mixed amino acid infusion was associated with increased glomerular filtration rate and renal consumption of oxygen. Changes in RBF of a mixed amino acid infusion could not be linked to plasma level or renal uptake of any individual amino acids.",

        "Abstract":"Carvedilol is an antihypertensive drug with properties that may be potentially beneficial for kidney graft recipients. The purpose of the study was to investigate if progression of an established chronic rejection may be attenuated or reversed by carvedilol. An open, single-centre, phase II, pilot study, with a 2-yr follow-up, was performed in 25 kidney graft recipients with chronic rejection or accelerated transplant atherosclerosis. Seventeen patients had stable graft function assessed by serum creatinine levels. Eight patients withdrew from the study due to lack of efficacy (increase in serum creatinine 174-477 micromol\/L (46-191%) from the initial levels). However. these patients had higher serum creatinine levels and proteinuria already at the start of the study. Both systolic and diastolic blood pressure, as well as heart rate, were stable in all study patients. Low density lipoprotein (LDL)\/high density lipoprotein (HDL) cholesterol ratio decreased from 4.7 +\/- 1.9 at 1 month to 3.5 +\/- 1.2 at 18 months (p < 0.05), and MDA plasma levels decreased from 0.714 +\/- 0.119 to 0.493 +\/- 0.073 micromol\/L after 3 months of carvedilol treatment (p < 0.05). No attenuation of progression of chronic graft rejection by carvedilol treatment was observed in the study. It is suggested that the process of chronic rejection could not be reversed by carvedilol because the patients included in the study already had severe morphological and functional changes of the graft. In conclusion, our study demonstrated that carvedilol provides a good control of blood pressure in renal transplanted patients. Carvedilol treatment had a beneficial effect on lipid pattern and reduced lipid oxidation, but there was no obvious effect on progression of chronic rejection.",

        "Published":null,
        "Abstract":"In this retrospective study, we evaluated the histological and biological predictors of long-term response of renal transplant (RT) patients treated with orthoclone OKT3 for steroid resistant acute rejection (AR). Seventy-three patients, aged 37 +\/- 12 years, were included in this study between March 1987 and December 1996. All the patients but one had received sequential quadruple immunosuppression (polyclonal antilymphocyte globulins; steroids; azathioprine, and cyclosporin A). OKT3 (5 mg\/day for 10 days) was administered for biopsy-proven steroid resistant AR i.e., after 3 consecutive pulses of methylprednisolone (10 mg\/kg each). This was the first AR in 46 cases, the second AR in 22 cases and the third AR in 4 cases. Renal histology (Banff) showed borderline (BL) changes in 18 patients, grade I AR in 28 patients; grade II AR in 22 patients, and grade III AR in 5 patients. When treatment with OKT3 commenced (107 +\/- 18 days post-transplantation) the mean serum creatinine (SCr) level was 325 +\/- 195 micromol\/l; this had decreased to 191 +\/- 106 micromol\/l by the end of OKT3 therapy. The immediate response to OKT3 therapy i. e., within the first month, was not dependent on the histological score. Twenty-six patients (35%) subsequently experienced at least one more AR episode of whom 4 were retreated with OKT3. The overall patient's survival was 94.5% at last follow-up. The overall cumulative graft survival was 64.5% at 2 years, 52.5% at 5 years, and 40.5% at 8 years. The graft survival (5 years) tended to depend on the initial histological score, i.e. BL 30%; grade I 66%; grades II and III 55.5% (p = 0.08). In a multiple logistic regression analysis we tried to identify independent factors that would predict that a graft would still be functioning at least 2 years after OKT3 therapy. We therefore analyzed the following parameters: donor and recipient's age; gender; cold ischemia time; HLA matching; panel reactive antibodies (PRA) prior to grafting; previous transplantation(s); total number of AR episodes; the time of onset of the AR treated by OKT3 compared to the other AR; the time of onset of the AR treated by OKT3; SCr levels at days 0, 10 and 30 after OKT3 therapy; histological score (Banff) i.e., the magnitude of AR and the presence or absence of chronic lesions. The only independent factors which would predict that a graft was still functioning 2 years after OKT3 therapy were: PRA <25% (Odds ratio (OR) 7.68 (1.15-51.3); p = 0.035); a grade I AR (OR 10.52 (1.18-93. 5); p = 0.035); SCr level 1 month after OKT3 therapy (OR 0.935 (0. 87-1.002); p = 0.05). HLA matching and the presence of histological chronic lesions were nearly significant (p = 0.06 and 0.09 respectively). In conclusion, this retrospective study shows that independent predictors of the long-term response to OKT3 therapy for AR in RT patients are the magnitude of pre-transplant PRA, the histological score, and the SCr level one month after OKT3 therapy.",

The patient presented with various medical problems including hypertension, intracranial hemorrhage, myocardial infarction, unstable angina pectoris, and poor control of diabetic mellitus and had exhibited rapid symptoms of androgen excess such as progressive hirsutism and bilateral temporal balding for half a year. Tumor survey was negative except for an elevated testosterone level. Renal vein catheterization successfully detected a right ovarian androgen-secreting tumor. Because the patient was deemed medically unable to tolerate surgery, she received an alternative treatment consisting of 6 months of gonadotropin-releasing hormone-agonist (GnRH-a) and add-back hormone replacement therapy (HRT). Serum testosterone levels returned to normal limits after administration of the first dose of GnRH-a. A follow-up tumor survey was negative. The patient has been alive and free of disease for 8 months after six doses of GnRH-a.

        "Abstract":"BACKGROUND: Underlying thrombophilic disorders increase the risk of early allograft loss after renal transplantation. We report three cases of early graft thrombosis in two carriers of a recently discovered prothrombotic variation of the prothrombin gene.\nCASE REPORTS: The first patient, an adolescent girl, developed multiple thrombotic shunt occlusions after the initiation of hemodialysis until continuous cumarin anticoagulation was instituted. During living-related kidney transplantation, peracute thrombosis of the renal arteries and veins occurred during surgery despite excellent intraoperative conditions and continuous low-dose heparinization. A few hours after reperfusion of the organ by immediate thrombectomy and intrarenal fibrinolysis, an irreversible rethrombosis occurred. A detailed evaluation of the coagulation system showed highly elevated prothrombin protein activity and concentrations. A heterozygous G-->A transition at position 20210 of the prothrombin gene was identified. Hemodialysis was resumed using recombinant hirudin, a direct and selective thrombin inhibitor, as an anticoagulant. The second patient, a girl with end-stage renal failure due to atypical hemolytic uremic syndrome, lost two cadaver kidney allografts, each time by massive thrombosis a few days after transplantation. In this patient also, elevated prothrombin activity and concentrations were present and a heterozygous G-->A transition at position 2210 of the prothrombin gene was detected.\nCONCLUSIONS: The prothrombin gene mutation is a new risk factor for thrombotic complications both on hemodialysis and after renal transplantation. It may be useful to screen for this disorder in the pretransplant thrombophilia work-up.",

        "Published":null,
        "Abstract":"Both aprotinin and gentamicin-vancomycin antibiotic prophylaxis have been used widely in cardiac surgery to prevent bleeding and infections, respectively. As the drugs are excreted almost entirely by glomerular filtration, we investigated their action on renal function when administered either separately or together. To increase consistency, we measured serum concentrations of creatinine and cystatin C, a new marker of glomerular filtration rate, that many recent studies have shown to be more sensitive than serum creatinine. One hundred patients undergoing coronary artery bypass surgery were allocated randomly to one of four groups: group A received antibiotic prophylaxis with cefamandole and no aprotinin; group B received cefamandole and high-dose aprotinin; group C received antibiotic prophylaxis with gentamicin and vancomycin, but no aprotinin; and group D received both high-dose aprotinin and gentamicin-vancomycin antibiotic prophylaxis. Data from 84 patients, for whom data collection was complete, were analysed. In the first week after operation, mean serum concentrations of cystatin C and creatinine either remained constant or decreased slowly in all groups, except for group D. In group D, both markers increased gradually from postoperative day 2 onwards. The increase in cystatin C was significant on postoperative day 5 (from mean 1.02 (SD 0.11) mg litre-1 before operation to 1.35 (0.32) mg litre-1; P < 0.05), reaching a peak on postoperative day 7 (1.45 (0.35) mg litre-1; P < 0.05), while the increase in creatinine concentration was significant on postoperative day 6 (from 1.05 (0.16) mg dl-1 before operation to 1.29 (0.34) mg dl-1; P < 0.05). We conclude that simultaneous administration of high-dose aprotinin and prophylactic use of gentamicin with vancomycin increased serum concentrations of cystatin C and creatinine in the first postoperative week in patients undergoing cardiac surgery.",

        "Abstract":"BACKGROUND: Despite progress, atherosclerotic vascular disease remains a major cause of morbidity and mortality. Intravenous therapy with platelet glycoprotein (GP) IIb\/IIIa receptor antagonists improves outcome in patients with acute coronary syndromes (ACS). Whether potent long-term antiplatelet therapy with oral GP IIb\/IIIa antagonists will further improve outcome at a dose that is tolerable in long-term treatment is unknown.\nTRIAL DESIGN: SYMPHONY (Sibrafiban versus aspirin to Yield Maximum Protection from ischemic Heart events post-acute cOroNary syndromes) was a randomized, double-blind, aspirin-controlled trial with 2 concentration regimens of sibrafiban, an oral peptidomimetic GP IIb\/IIIa antagonist, for long-term treatment instead of aspirin in patients after an ACS. Patients were eligible for SYMPHONY if they presented within 7 days of an ACS (>\/=20 minutes of ischemic symptoms), had been clinically stable for at least 12 hours, and met one of the following inclusion criteria: ST-segment depression or elevation of at least 0.5 mm or new left bundle branch block with the ACS or elevated creatinine kinase MB more than the upper limit of normal and >3% of total creatine kinase or, if creatine kinase MB was not measured, an elevated level of troponin T or I. Approximately 9000 patients post ACS were randomized 1:1:1 to treatment with either aspirin (80 mg every 12 hours) or high-dose or low-dose sibrafiban every 12 hours. Assignment of tablet strength (3, 4.5, or 6 mg) within the sibrafiban arms was based on body weight and renal function to achieve a target steady-state plasma concentration. The duration of study drug therapy was 90 days. Patients who had intracoronary stenting during the course of the study initially received a blinded stent medication assignment for 2 to 4 weeks based on their initial randomization as follows: aspirin\/ticlopidine 250 mg twice daily, low-dose sibrafiban\/ticlopidine placebo twice daily, and high-dose sibrafiban\/ticlopidine placebo twice daily. After the second interim safety assessment by the Data and Safety Monitoring Board the stent regimen for the low-dose group was modified to include ticlopidine 250 mg twice daily.\nEND POINTS: The primary efficacy end point of SYMPHONY was the 90-day incidence of a composite of all-cause mortality, myocardial infarction or reinfarction, and severe recurrent ischemia. A clinical events classification committee was established to determine the end points of reinfarction and severe recurrent ischemia. The primary safety end points were the incidence of major bleeding or minor bleeding and the combined incidence of major and minor bleeding. Bleeding classification was done by computer algorithm. Tolerability was assessed by the rate of study drug discontinuation from bleeding.",

        "Abstract":"Recanalization of a totally occluded saphenous vein graft (SVG) using commercially available urokinase from human kidney cells has been shown to be effective, but the duration of infusion and complications such as allergic reactions, bleeding events, and non-Q-wave myocardial infarction have limited its acceptance. Recently, genetic engineering has allowed the synthesis of recombinant urokinase (r-UK). Patients with an occluded SVG from 37 centers were randomized to receive a 6-hour infusion of either low-dose (125,000 IU\/hour) or high-dose (350,000 IU\/hour) r-UK followed by up to a maximum of 18 hours of r-UK (125,000 IU\/hour) via a subselective catheter directly into the occluded vein graft. The primary study end point was final preintervention achievement of Thrombolysis In Myocardial Infarction (TIMI) flow > or = 2 using core angiographic analysis. One hundred seven patients were randomized and 98 received the study drug (low dose 52 patients, high dose 46 patients). TIMI flow > or = 2 after completion of the study drug was higher in the high-dose group (51% vs 24%, p = 0.019). This difference narrowed, but a trend was still evident on the final angiogram after adjunctive mechanical intervention (72% vs 58%, p = 0.254). Bleeding complications were frequent; severe or life-threatening bleeding occurred in 12% of patients on the low dose and 11% of patients on the high dose (p = NS), including 2 intracerebral bleeds, both of which were fatal with 1 in each group. Thus, in patients with an occluded SVG, a randomized trial of direct low-dose versus high-dose r-UK infusion demonstrated increased recanalization rates (TIMI flow > or = 2) in the high-dose arm. Percutaneous revascularization of SVG with r-UK can be accomplished with acceptable success rates, but complications are frequent.",

        "Abstract":"OBJECTIVE: In acute type A dissection long-term results of conservative aortic root surgery were compared with the outcome of primary valve and\/or root replacement.\nMETHODS: Between 1985 and 1995, 199 patients (mean age 59 years, 154 men) were operated on. The aortic root was involved in the dissection process and valve incompetence of varying degree was present without exception. Replacement of a proximal aortic segment was standard procedure in all patients. The aortic valve was preserved in 126 patients: commissural suture resuspension (12 patients), root reconstruction with GRF-glue (gelatine-resorcin-formaldehyde\/glutaraldehyde-glue) (114 patients). Valve replacement was performed in 73 patients (50 composite grafts, 23 valve prostheses with separate supracoronary grafts). Preoperative risk factors (valve replacement vs. preservation): coronary artery disease (11 vs. 8%, NS), tamponade (18 vs. 17%, NS), unstable hemodynamics (22 vs. 15%, NS), renal failure (4 vs. 6%, NS), neurologic disorder (19 vs. 32%, NS).\nRESULTS: The overall early mortality was 23.6% (47\/199 patients) and increased after commissural suture resuspension compared with GRF-glue reconstruction (P = NS). Parameters of the early postoperative period did not differ between conservative treatment and root\/valve replacement: low cardiac output, 34 versus 38% (P = NS); myocardial infarction, 10 versus 11% (P = NS); hemorrhage, 25 versus 23% (P = NS); duration of intensive care (P = NS). Survival was 61% after 8 years without difference between the two principal treatment groups (P = NS) and between the two conservative subgroups (P = NS). At 2 years, GRF-glue reconstruction had an increased freedom from reoperation on the aortic root (92 vs. 70%, P = 0.0253) and event free survival (77 vs. 41%, P = 0.0224) compared with suture resuspension. Commissural suture resuspension was an independent, significant predictor for reoperation (P = 0.0221, relative risk = 4.7130).\nCONCLUSION: Surgery for acute type A dissection still carries a considerable early risk. Preservation of the aortic root is safe in the absence of Marfan or annuloaortic ectasia, but a certain incidence of reoperations on the aortic valve and the aortic root has to be accepted. Root reconstruction using GRF-glue is the method of choice and is superior to suture resuspension, with a significantly better reoperation-free and event-free survival.",

        "Abstract":"OBJECTIVES: Several studies have shown angiotensin-converting enzyme (ACE) inhibitors to confer significant mortality and morbidity benefits in heart failure. First-dose hypotension may necessitate interruption of such therapy. This is more likely to occur if the ACE inhibitor is administered early after coronary artery bypass grafting (CABG). The purpose of this study was to analyse the haemodynamic tolerance to early post-operative treatment with perindopril and enalapril in patients with impaired renal and ventricular function.\nMETHODS: Eighty one consecutive CABG patients with a previous myocardial infarction, impaired pre-operative left ventricular ejection fraction (LVEF) on ventriculography and moderately impaired renal function (serum creatinine of 115-150 micromol\/l) were randomised into three groups to receive oral placebo, perindopril (4 mg) or enalapril (5 mg) once daily. Groups were subdivided into those with mild ventricular dysfunction (LVEF = 35-65%, n = 20) and significant ventricular dysfunction (LVEF < 35%, n = 7). Exclusion criteria included oliguria (<0.5 ml\/kg per h) or inotrope dependance at the point of entry on the first post-operative day. Intolerance to ACE inhibitor was defined as hypotension (<95 mmHg systolic blood pressure or a decrease exceeding 25 mmHg in systolic blood pressure) leading to oliguria (<0.5 ml\/kg per h) which was unresponsive to intravenous furosemide (20 mg). In such cases ACE inhibitor treatment was discontinued and patients commenced on dopamine.\nRESULTS: In the groups with mild ventricular dysfunction (LVEF = 35-65%) perindopril was discontinued in 1\/20 and enalapril in 4\/20 patients (P = n.s). However, in the groups with significant ventricular dysfunction (LVEF < 35%) perindopril was discontinued in 2\/7 and enalapril in 7\/7 patients (P = 0.02).\nCONCLUSION: Our results suggest that after CABG, patients with moderately impaired renal function and significant ventricular dysfunction do not tolerate ACE inhibitors well when these were commenced on the first post-operative day. However, perindopril was associated with less haemodynamic deterioration than enalapril and consequently may be advantageous in this setting. rights reserved.",

        "Abstract":"BACKGROUND: Between September 20, 1995 and September 20, 1997, 208 adult patients undergoing renal transplantation were randomized to receive tacrolimus\/prednisone (n=106) or tacrolimus\/prednisone\/mycophenolate mofetil (n=102), with the goal of reducing the incidence of rejection.\nMETHODS: The mean recipient age was 50.7+\/-13.7 years. Sixty-three (30.3%) patients were 60 years of age or older at the time of transplantation. The mean donor age was 34.5+\/-21.7 years. The mean cold ischemia time was 30.5+\/-9.2 hr. The mean follow-up is 15+\/-7 months.\nRESULTS: The overall 1-year actuarial patient survival was 94%; the overall 1-year actuarial graft survival was 87%. When the patient and graft survival data were stratified to recipients under the age of 60 who did not have delayed graft function, the overall 1-year actuarial patient survival was 97%, and the corresponding 1-year actuarial graft survival was 93%. There were no differences between the two groups. The overall incidence of rejection was 36%; in the double-therapy group, it was 44%, whereas in the triple therapy group, it was 27% (P=0.014). The mean serum creatinine was 1.6+\/-0.8 mg\/dl. A total of 36% of the successfully transplanted patients were taken off prednisone; 32% of the patients were taken off antihypertensive medications. The incidence of delayed graft function was 21%, the incidence of cytomegalovirus was 12.5%, and the initial and final incidences of posttransplant insulin-dependent diabetes mellitus were 7.0% and 2.9%; again, there was no difference between the two groups.\nCONCLUSIONS: This trial suggests that the combination of tacrolimus, steroids, and mycophenolate mofetil is associated with excellent patient and graft survival and a lower incidence of rejection than the combination of tacrolimus and steroids.",

        "Abstract":"OBJECTIVES: This study was done to test the hypothesis that a forced diuresis with maintenance of intravascular volume after contrast exposure would reduce the rate of contrast-induced renal injury.\nBACKGROUND: We have previously shown a graded relationship with the degree of postprocedure renal failure and the probability of in-hospital death in patients undergoing percutaneous coronary intervention. Earlier studies of singular prevention strategies (atrial natriuretic factor, loop diuretics, dopamine, mannitol) have shown no clear benefit across a spectrum of patients at risk.\nMETHODS: A prospective, randomized, controlled, single-blind trial was conducted where 98 participants were randomized to forced diuresis with intravenous crystalloid, furosemide, mannitol (if pulmonary capillary wedge pressure <20 mm Hg), and low-dose dopamine (n = 43) versus intravenous crystalloid and matching placebos (n = 55).\nRESULTS: The groups were similar with respect to baseline serum creatinine (2.44+\/-0.80 and 2.55+\/-0.91 mg\/dl), age, weight, diabetic status, left ventricular function, degree of prehydration, contrast volume and ionicity, and extent of peripheral vascular disease. The forced diuresis resulted in higher urine flow rate (163.26+\/-54.47 vs. 122.57+\/-54.27 ml\/h) over the 24 h after contrast exposure (p = 0.001). Two participants in the experimental arm versus five in the control arm required dialysis, with all seven cases having measured flow rates <145 ml\/h in the 24 h after the procedure. The mean individual change in serum creatinine at 48 h, the primary end point, was 0.48+\/-0.86 versus 0.51+\/-0.87, in the experimental and control arms, respectively, p = 0.87. There were no differences in the rates of renal failure across six definitions of renal failure by intent-to-treat analysis. However, in all participants combined, the rise in serum creatinine was related to the degree of induced diuresis after controlling for baseline renal function, r = -0.36, p = 0.005. The rates of renal failure in those with urine flow rates greater than 150 ml\/h in the postprocedure period were significantly lower, 8\/37 (21.6%) versus 28\/61 (45.9%), p = 0.03.\nCONCLUSIONS: Forced diuresis with intravenous crystalloid, furosemide, and mannitol if hemodynamics permit, beginning at the start of angiography provides a modest benefit against contrast-induced nephropathy provided a high urine flow rate can be achieved.",

        "Abstract":"PURPOSE: Between September 20, 1995 and September 20, 1996, 120 patients were entered into a prospective, randomized trial comparing tacrolimus and prednisone with (61) and without (59) 2 gm. mycophenolate mofetil daily to determine whether mycophenolate mofetil was associated with a lower incidence of rejection.\nMATERIALS AND METHODS: Mean recipient age plus or minus standard deviation was 50.8+\/-14.1 years (range 18.8 to 84.1). Mean donor age was 34.3+\/-21.7 years (range 0.01 to 76). Of the donors 18 (15%) were older than 60 years. Mean cold ischemia time was 30.9+\/-8.4 hours (range 14.2 to 49). Median followup was 8.6+\/-0.5 months.\nRESULTS: The 6-month actuarial patient survival was 95%, 92% in the double therapy group and 98% in the triple therapy group (not significant). The 6-month actuarial graft survival was 88%, 84% in the double therapy group and 92% in the triple therapy group (not significant). The overall incidence of rejection and steroid resistant rejection was 34.2 and 4.2%, respectively. There was a strong trend toward less rejection in the mycophenolate mofetil group than in the double therapy group (26.2 versus 42.4%). Crossover was common, and was 42.6% from triple to double therapy and 18.6% from double to triple therapy. The reasons for discontinuation of mycophenolate mofetil were gastrointestinal toxicity, primarily diarrhea, or less commonly hematological toxicity, primarily neutropenia or thrombocytopenia. Gastrointestinal toxicity was ameliorated by separating the doses of tacrolimus and mycophenolate mofetil by 2 to 4 hours, and reducing the dose to 1 gm. daily.\nCONCLUSIONS: Mycophenolate mofetil appears to be a useful third agent with tacrolimus in patients undergoing renal transplantation, and is associated with a reduction in the rate of rejection and a low incidence of steroid resistant rejection. There is a high incidence of gastrointestinal toxicity associated with the 2 gm. daily dose but this complication is relatively straightforward to manage.",

Here we present the early results and technical considerations of the administration of basic fibroblast growth factor for the induction of collateral growth using heparin-alginate slow-release devices in patients undergoing coronary artery bypass grafting.\nMETHODS: Eight patients were enrolled. Patients were candidates if they had at least one graftable obstructed coronary artery and at least one major arterial distribution not amenable to revascularization, a serum creatinine level less than 3 mg\/dL, ejection fraction greater than 0.20, and estimated operative mortality of less than 25%. During conventional coronary artery bypass grafting, 10 heparin-alginate devices, each containing either 1 microg or 10 microg of basic fibroblast growth factor, were implanted in the epicardial fat in multiple regions of the unrevascularizable territory and also in the distal distribution of a grafted or patent artery.\nRESULTS: There was no mortality and no evidence of renal, hematologic, or hepatic toxicity during follow-up. Three months after the operation, all patients remain free of angina. Seven patients were examined with stress perfusion scans. Three patients had clear enhancement of perfusion to the unrevascularized myocardium, 1 patient had a new fixed defect, and 3 had minimal overall change but had evidence of new small, fixed perfusion defects. Seven patients had improved or similar myocardial contractile function (ejection fraction at 3-month follow-up = 0.53 +\/- 0.22 versus 0.47 +\/- 0.14 preoperatively). One patient suffered a perioperative myocardial infarction in the area of basic fibroblast growth factor administration.\nCONCLUSIONS: This preliminary study demonstrates the safety and technical feasibility of therapeutic angiogenesis with basic fibroblast growth factor delivered by heparin-alginate slow-release devices.

However, after adopting this practice in our cardiac surgery program, we perceived an increased incidence of postoperative renal dysfunction.\nMETHODS: A directed record review of postoperative renal function was conducted for consecutive patients undergoing cardiac operation for the time periods before and after adoption of prophylactic intravenous diltiazem (0.1 mg.kg-1.h-1 for 24 hours). The two groups were compared using chi 2 and two-sample t tests. The risk of development of postoperative renal failure was modeled with logistic regression.\nRESULTS: Diltiazem-treated patients (n = 271) were similar to the control patients (n = 143) in terms of age (64 versus 61 years; p = 0.14), ejection fraction (0.46 versus 0.47; p = 0.61), baseline serum creatinine level (1.2 versus 1.1 mg\/dL; p = 0.27), prevalence of comorbid conditions, and surgical characteristics. The prevalence of left main coronary artery disease was lower in the diltiazem group than the control group (39% versus 52%; p = 0.01). During the 7-day postoperative period, the average peak serum creatinine level was higher in the diltiazem group (1.7 +\/- 0.9 mg\/dL; mean +\/- 1 standard deviation) than the control group (1.5 +\/- 0.5 mg\/dL; p = 0.003). The incidence of acute renal failure requiring dialysis was 4.4% in the diltiazem group versus 0.7% in the control group (p = 0.04). There was no difference in length of hospitalization or mortality. The risk of acute renal failure was strongly associated with intravenous diltiazem (adjusted odds ratio [AOR] 6.3; p = 0.08), age (AOR 2.5 per 10 years; p = 0.07), baseline serum creatinine (AOR 4.8 per 1 mg\/dL; p = 0.02), the presence of left main coronary disease (AOR 5.3; p = 0.02), and the presence of cerebrovascular disease (AOR 4.5; p = 0.05).\nCONCLUSIONS: Our retrospective analysis suggests that prophylactic use of intravenous diltiazem in patients undergoing cardiac operations was associated with increased renal dysfunction.

In this study early and late results of root replacement in acute dissection are determined and compared with supracoronary graft replacement. Two implantation techniques (open vs. inclusion) are evaluated.\nMETHODS: Between 1985 and 1995, 207 consecutive patients (mean age 58 +\/- 12 years, 78% men) were operated for acute type A dissection of the aorta. Root replacement in 50 patients (inclusion technique in 34\/50 patients with Cabrol shunt in 15\/34 patients, open technique in 16\/50 patients) was compared with more conservative procedures in 157 patients: supracoronary graft replacement in 143 patients (with aortic valve replacement in 23 patients) and local repair without graft interposition in 14 patients. Preoperative risk factors, like hemodynamic instability, renal failure, neurologic disorder and coronary artery disease did not differ in the two treatment groups.\nRESULTS: Early results, survival and reoperation-free survival after 5 years were insignificantly better after root replacement: mortality 10\/50 (20%) vs. 38\/157 (24%) P = n.s.; hemorrhage 10\/50 (20%) vs. 39\/157 (25%) P = n.s.; stroke 5\/50 (10%) vs. 27\/157 (17%) P = n.s.; survival 70 +\/- 7% vs. 63 +\/- 4%, reoperation free survival 92 +\/- 6% vs. 78 +\/- 5% P = 0.0815). For the open technique, early mortality was 18.8 vs. 20.6%, P = n.s. and reoperation free survival at 5 years was 80.7 vs. 65.2%, P = n.s. Perioperative complications did not differ in the two technical groups and a single pseudoaneurysm occurred in the Bentall group.\nCONCLUSION: In acute dissection composite graft replacement of the aortic root can be carried out with good early and late results not inferior to more conservative procedures. The open technique is the implantation method of choice and the modified Bentall technique is indicated in situations with increased risk of bleeding.",

The objective of the present study was to assess the efficacy and safety of this pharmacologic protocol. Two hundred forty-eight patients participated in the study; the mean age was 65.8 +\/- 9.4 years, 20% were women, and the mean preoperative ejection fraction was 48%. The low-flow corrected CPB MAP attained for the low and high MAP groups was 56.7 +\/- 5.0 mmHg and 77.7 +\/- 7.1 mmHg, respectively (p = 0.0001). Major cardiac and neurologic outcomes, postoperative blood loss, renal dysfunction, intensive care unit (ICU) stay, and duration of intubation were not found to be significantly associated with any drug in the pharmacologic protocol.

        "Published":null,
        "Abstract":"UNLABELLED: Left ventricular dysfunction is common after cardiac surgery and is often treated with positive inotropic drugs (PIDs). We hypothesized that the use of PIDs after cardiac valve surgery would have significant associations with the valvular pathophysiology and surgical procedure, and unlike the case for patients undergoing coronary artery surgery, would be unrelated to duration of cardiopulmonary bypass (CPB) or of aortic clamping. One hundred forty-nine consenting patients undergoing cardiac valve surgery were studied. Patients with hepatic or renal failure, or New York Heart Association class IV cardiac symptoms, were excluded. Patients were considered to have received PIDs if they received an infusion of amrinone, dobutamine, epinephrine, or dopamine (> or = 5 microg x kg[-1] x min[-1]). PIDs were received by 78 patients (52%). In a univariate model, older age, history of congestive heart failure, decreasing left ventricular ejection fraction, longer durations of CPB, and concurrent coronary artery surgery significantly increased the likelihood of PID support. There was also significant variation by anesthesiologist in the administration of PIDs. The specific diseased valve and valvular stenosis or insufficiency did not influence the likelihood of receiving PID support. In a multivariable model, age, history of congestive heart failure, decreasing left ventricular ejection fraction, and anesthesiologist were significantly associated with the likelihood of PID support, but duration of CPB and concurrent coronary artery surgery were not. In conclusion, patient age and ventricular function, as well as physician preferences, predicted the need for inotropic drug support; however, neither the specific valvular lesion, nor duration of CPB were strongly predictive in a multivariable model.\nIMPLICATIONS: We evaluated factors related to use of positive inotropic drugs after cardiac valve surgery. The likelihood of a patient receiving these drugs increases with advancing age and with more severe preoperative left ventricular dysfunction, but was not influenced by the specific diseased valve or the duration of cardiopulmonary bypass.",

Those involved were consecutive patients with acute Q-wave myocardial infarction admitted within 96 h of onset of symptoms to 136 German hospitals between July 1992 and September 1994 (n = 14980, median age 66 (quartiles 57, 74) years, 68% male, 48% anterior wall infarction). Median pre-hospital delay was 170 (90, 475) min, with 17% arriving within the first hour and 61% within 4 h of onset of symptoms. The following patient groups had a short pre-hospital delay: males, those aged less than 65 years, those admitted at night or the weekend, those with a previous myocardial infarction, those in need of cardiopulmonary resuscitation, and those with a diagnostic first ECG. The first ECG was diagnostic in 67.6% of cases. Reperfusion therapy was used in 53%, with thrombolytic therapy in 51.6%. Median time from admission to initiation of treatment was 30 (20, 55) min. Respective rates of treatment with aspirin, nitrates, and beta-blockers were 81%, 83%, and 16%. Major complications were cerebral bleeding (0.4%), bleeding requiring transfusions (0.9%), left ventricular rupture (0.6%) and anaphylactic shock (0.1%). Median hospital stay was 20 (13, 26) days. In-hospital death rate was 17.2%. Increased hospital mortality was observed with female gender, an unknown or long pre-hospital delay, a diagnostic first ECG, anterior wall infarction, trauma or major operation within the last 14 days, renal insufficiency and malignoma.\nCONCLUSIONS: 'Real-life' hospital mortality is much higher than previously reported in clinical trials. To reduce hospital mortality, the efficacy of thrombolysis should be increased by shortening the pre-hospital delay, and the use of concomitant therapy, especially beta-blockers, should be increased.",

A case presenting with aortic thrombus and successive distal embolism is reported herein and the aetiology of the thrombus of the distal aortic arch is analysed by a three dimensional aortic model. A 61-year-old man suffered acute ischaemia in his right leg on January 26, 1994. Enhanced computed tomography (CT) showed a localized thrombus in the distal aortic arch expanding towards the descending aorta, and partial infarction of the left kidney and the spleen. Angiography demonstrated abrupt occlusion of the right superficial femoral artery. Immediate anticoagulation with heparin and coumadin was administered, and the thrombus in the aorta disappeared following 1 month of this medical treatment, leaving the renal and splenic infarction unchanged. The unresolved occlusion of the superficial femoral artery and the popliteal artery was treated with a bypass from the right superficial femoral artery to the peroneal artery using a reversed saphenous vein graft. The mould model of the thoracic aorta was reconstructed from CT, and the thrombus was found to be at the most distal and medial site of the lesser curvature of the aortic arch. This specific location is referred mostly as the site for thrombus formation in the literature. The case is reported briefly and the risk of this specific region of the thoracic aorta for thrombus formation is discussed using this mold model.",

        "Abstract":"BACKGROUND: Tacrolimus (FK506) has recently become available clinically as an alternative to cyclosporine-based immunosuppression. This study reports the middle-term results of a prospective, randomized trial that compared FK506 with cyclosporine-based immunosuppression in heart transplant recipients.\nMETHODS: Twenty-five consecutive patients were randomized at a 2:1 ratio into two groups, one of which received FK506 (15 patients), the other cyclosporine (10 patients). Both groups received similar concomitant immunosuppression. The patients were followed up for 12 months. The following outcome parameters were analyzed: survival, rejection and infection rate, lymphocyte subsets, new-onset diabetes, renal and hepatic function, hypertension, right-sided heart catheterization data, graft coronary artery disease, and neurologic side effects.\nRESULTS: The mortality rate (two patients) in the FK506 group was 13% versus 0% in the cyclosporine group (p = NS). The two deaths were the consequences of early infections and higher doses of FK506. From the outset, the FK506 group presented a lower prevalence of acute rejection, a lower requirement for rejection treatments and a higher incidence of infections. Accordingly, we reduced overall immunosuppression for the last seven patients in the FK506 group; the decrease in FK506 and prednisone dosage led to a decrease in the early infection rate without an increase in the rejection rate. There was no difference between the two groups in diabetes incidence, renal and hepatic function, right-sided heart catheterization data, or coronary angiograms. Hypertension was less frequent and milder in the FK506 group.\nCONCLUSIONS: This experience suggests that FK506 can be safely used in heart transplantation. It can decrease the frequency of rejection episodes. Low-dose administration allows a lower infection rate without an increase in rejection. With a protocol of delayed starting and low dosing, side effects such as renal toxicity, hypertension, and neurologic toxicity seem to be unlikely. Further studies are needed to establish the exact dosage and therapeutic levels of the drug.",

Overall, the safety profiles of the tacrolimus- and cyclosporine-based regimens were quite comparable. Infections, renal impairment, neurological complications, and gastrointestinal complaints were frequently reported but were mostly reversible in both groups. Higher incidences of elevated serum creatinine, tremor, diarrhea, hyperglycemia, diabetes mellitus, and angina pectoris were reported in the tacrolimus treatment group, whereas acne, arrhythmia, gingival hyperplasia, and hirsutism were more frequent with cyclosporine treatment.\nCONCLUSIONS: The significant reduction in the incidence of episodes of allograft rejection observed with tacrolimus therapy may have important long-term implications given the prognostic influence of rejection on graft survival.",

        "Abstract":"OBJECTIVE: To evaluate the effects of minimal-dose aprotinin in patients undergoing coronary artery bypass grafting, we conducted a prospective randomized study.\nMETHODS: A total of 167 patients were randomized to receive no aprotinin treatment (control, n = 57), minimal-dose aprotinin (1.0 x 10(6) KIU; n = 55), or low-dose aprotinin (2.7 +\/- 0.5 x 10(6) KIU; n = 55). Blood loss and transfusion requirements, parameters of clotting and fibrinolysis, renal function, and early graft patency rates were assessed.\nRESULTS: Postoperative blood loss and transfusion requirements were significantly (p = 0.01) lower in both the minimal-dose and low-dose groups than in the control group. The increase in D-dimer level after cardiopulmonary bypass was significantly (p < 0.05) less marked in the low-dose group than in the control group. The alpha 2-plasmin inhibitor and plasminogen activator inhibitor-1 levels were significantly (p < 0.05) greater in the minimal-dose and low-dose groups than in the control group after bypass, suggesting the prevention of fibrinolysis by both aprotinin doses. No statistically significant differences in postoperative renal function and early vein graft patency rates were noted (control group, 93.8%; minimal-dose group, 95.5%; low-dose group, 92.3%; p = 0.25).\nCONCLUSIONS: Aprotinin was not associated with a significant increase in the prevalence of renal dysfunction or early vein graft occlusion. Minimal-dose aprotinin inhibited enhanced fibrinolytic activity and reduced blood loss and transfusion requirements after bypass equivalently to low-dose aprotinin. The dose of 1 x 10(6) KIU added to the pump prime may be acceptably effective in reducing blood loss in patients undergoing primary coronary operations.",

        "Abstract":"The authors introduce a new technique for performing aortic stop-flow infusion (ASI) or hypoxic abdominal perfusion (HAP) to treat advanced thoracoabdominal tumors, via an angiographic percutaneous approach. To date, the maneuver has always been performed with surgical exposure of vascular sites in the groins. The materials available on the market were initially used and then dedicated materials have been developed, such as 11-F vascular sheaths, 8-F catheters, latex balloons with maximum phi's of 4 cm and maximum capacity of 70 ml. We performed 72 maneuvers in 56 patients during 22 months. No technical or instrumental complications occurred and all treatments were successful. Three patients (6%) died within 12 hours, two because of ARDS following thoracic perfusion and one for acute renal failure and disseminated intravascular coagulation following abdominal perfusion. The percutaneous approach provides the same mechanical-occlusive efficacy for aortocaval occlusion and therefore the same therapeutic results as surgery, but it has fewer risks of technical complications and no technical failures. Moreover, this technique is more repeatable and less expensive than surgery and its hospital stay and recovery time are shorter. To conclude, the ASI\/HAP procedure is an interesting therapeutic chance in otherwise untreatable advanced cancer patients offering several prospects of technical and pharmacologic development to further increase its efficacy.",

        "Abstract":"OBJECTIVE: The use of aprotinin in cardiac surgery to improve haemostasis and reduce blood loss particularly in patient groups at increased risk of bleeding is well established. Previous retrospective studies in profound hypothermic surgery have highlighted concerns that in this circumstances aprotinin may paradoxically cause increased bleeding and intravascular thrombosis. We therefore adopted a modified protocol for administering aprotinin, which was not started until cardiopulmonary bypass had been reinstituted after circulatory arrest.\nMETHODS: Between April 1993 and June 1995, 45 patients underwent 46 thoracic aortic procedures which required hypothermic circulatory arrest; 25 of these were emergencies. All of these patients received aprotinin.\nRESULTS: There were five deaths (10.8%) in hospital. Two patients with preoperative oliguric renal failure required postoperative dialysis, and a further six (13%) developed transient renal dysfunction with complete recovery. Two patients suffered postoperative stroke; one from embolisation of a severely diseased aorta, while the other had signs of an acute evolving stroke before surgery. None of the patients suffered acute Q-wave perioperative myocardial infarction. The mean blood loss was 575 ml in the first 12 h, with a mean postoperative transfusion requirement of 1 U blood.\nCONCLUSIONS: We cannot implicate aprotinin in increased postoperative blood loss, renal dysfunction or mortality when used with hypothermic circulatory arrest according to this protocol. Elucidating the role of aprotinin in hypothermic circulatory arrest requires a randomised prospective study.",

        "Published":null,
        "Abstract":"After cardiac surgery, transient renal dysfunction often occurs. The main reasons for impairment of renal function are intraoperative hypotension, ischemia\/reperfusion injury and inflammatory response to cardiopulmonary bypass (CPB). Pentoxifylline is known to have anti-inflammatory properties. Gamma-hydroxybutyrate (GHB), an endogenous regulator of energy metabolism, showed beneficial effects on experimental intestinal ischemia\/reperfusion injury and liver graft function. Both drugs may be of practical interest in diminishing renal damage during and after cardiac surgery. After approval by the ethics committee and informed consent, 45 patients for elective coronary artery bypass grafting with no clinical and laboratory impairment of renal function were randomized into 3 groups (15 patients each): group 1 received saline as control, group 2 received pentoxifylline intraoperatively (1 mg\/kg\/h after a priming dose of 1 mg\/kg) and group 3 received GHB intraoperatively (25 mg\/kg\/h after a priming dose of 25 mg\/kg) in a double-blinded fashion. During 3 periods (before CPB, from the beginning of CPB until the end of surgery, 24 hours postoperatively), glomerular (creatinine clearance, CCr) and tubular markers of renal function (beta-NAG, alpha 1-microglobulin) were detected in addition to clinical routine standards (creatinine, urea, fractional excretion of sodium). Changes in glomerular and in tubular function were comparable in all groups without characteristic effects of either GHB or pentoxifylline. With CPB, CCr decreased significantly until the end of operation, but showed a rise to preoperative levels on the first day after operation. Tubular function markers (beta-NAG, alpha 1-microglobulin, related to simultaneous excretion of creatinine) showed a remarkable rise after the beginning of CPB up to the postoperative period. The results of the present pilot study suggest the detection of tubular proteins and enzymes a useful addition to present routine clinical standards for recognizing early intraoperative changes in renal function. In the patients studied, there were no clinical signs of renal dysfunction. Neither GHB nor pentoxifylline--in the doses applied--was able to show a therapeutic benefit despite the theoretical advantages.",

Twenty-seven (69.2%) patients were male, 18 (46.2%) were operated on on an emergency basis, 15 (38.5%) were acute type A dissections, and two (5.1%) were redo-operations. Circulatory arrest times were not significantly different between the two groups (40 +\/- 4 (S.E.) group I vs. 43 +\/- 4 min group II, P = 0.62) likewise cardiopulmonary bypass (CPB) times (181 +\/- 9 vs. 201 +\/- 20 mm, P = 0.74) and the amount of heparin administered (32056 +\/- 1435 vs. 31 691 +\/- 1935 IU, P = 0.56).\nRESULTS: Postoperative blood loss was comparable between the two groups (1213 +\/- 243 (median 850) group I vs. 1528 +\/- 377 (median 880) ml group II, P = 0.87), as well as the number of units of donor blood transfused (9.4 +\/- 3.0 (median 6) vs. 9.9 +\/- 3.6, (median 5) P = 0.87), and revisions for bleeding (2\/18, 11.1% vs. 3\/21, 14.3%, P = 0.77). In-hospital mortality rate was not statistically different (5\/18, 27.7% group I vs. 6\/21, 28.6% group II, P = 0.92). There were no significant differences between the two groups in myocardial infarction (2\/18, 11.1% vs. 0\/21, 0%, P = 0.21), and postoperative renal failure rates (3\/18, 16.7% vs. 2\/21, 9.5%, P = 0.65). On the other hand, there was a trend towards an increased incidence of permanent neurological deficit (5\/18, 27.7% group I vs. 1\/21, 4.8% group II, P = 0.07) and towards a more complicated postoperative course (perioperative renal failure and\/or myocardial infarction and\/or neurological deficit either transient or permanent) (8\/18, 44.4% group I vs. 4\/21, 19% group II, P = 0.09) in group I patients. Forward stepwise logistic regression analysis, performed on the whole group of patients, identified chronic obstructive pulmonary disease (P = 0.010, Odds ratio (OR) = 5.7), aprotinin use (P = 0.017, OR = 5.1), and the number of units of blood collected intraoperatively by the cellsaver (P = 0.045, OR = 1.3\/unit) as independent predictors of complicated postoperative course in the whole group of patients. CPB time (P = 0.040, OR = 1.032\/min), circulatory arrest time (P = 0.053, OR = 1.22\/min), and overall donor blood units transfused (P = 0.067, OR = 1.37\/unit) emerged as independent risk factors for in-hospital mortality at multivariate analysis.\nCONCLUSIONS: Even when appropriate amounts of heparin are administered, 'high-dose' aprotinin probably is not an effective blood-sparing drug in deep HCA. Aprotinin should be employed cautiously in this clinical setting because of its possible correlation with an increased rate of postoperative morbid events.",

The patients were stratified as to risk of excessive bleeding.\nRESULTS: All three aprotinin doses were highly effective in reducing bleeding and transfusion requirements. Consistent efficacy was not, however, demonstrated in the subgroup of patients at low risk for bleeding. There were no differences in mortality or the incidences of renal failure, strokes, or definite myocardial infarctions between the groups, although the pump-prime-only dose was associated with a small increase in definite, probable, or possible myocardial infarctions (p = 0.045).\nCONCLUSIONS: Low-dose and pump-prime-only aprotinin regimens provide reductions in bleeding and transfusion requirements that are similar to those of high-dose regimens. Although safe, aprotinin is not routinely indicated for the first-time coronary artery bypass grafting patient who is at low risk for postoperative bleeding. The pump-prime-only dose is not currently recommended because of a possible association with more frequent myocardial infarctions.",

Twenty patients were included in the study: 10 patients in the nifedipine group (group A) and 10 patients in the control group (group B). In group A, nifedipine was continuously administered during CPB at an infusion rate ranging from 0.24 to 0.59 micrograms\/kg\/min to maintain the mean systemic arterial pressure (MAP) between 60 and 70 mmHg. In group B, increases of MAP above 70 mmHg were treated with IV boluses of urapidil (5 mg).\nMEASUREMENTS AND MAIN RESULTS: Renal function was studied using creatinine clearance (CRCL), determined before, during, and after the operation, and the glomerular filtration rate (GFR) was measured the day before and after the operation by plasma and urine clearance of 51-chromium edetic acid (51Cr-EDTA). Hemodynamic monitoring was performed using a pulmonary artery catheter. In comparison with preoperative determinations, CRCL and GFR values increased significantly after CPB (p < 0.001) and after the operation (p < 0.01) in the patients treated with nifedipine, whereas the two parameters showed a small and not significant reduction at the same times in the control patients.

        "Abstract":"The efficacy and safety of (1-28) alpha-human ANP in preventing acute tubular necrosis (ATN) in cadaveric renal transplantation was tested by comparing ANP infusion with a maximal hydration (MH) regimen which we previously reported as effective in lowering the incidence of ATN (1, 2). Since the production of endogenous ANP increases with volume overloading (3), we hypothesized that increased endogenous ANP production may contribute to the beneficial effects of MH in renal transplant recipients. We thus conducted an open randomized study comparing the effect on early renal allograft function of MH (control group) versus moderate hydration plus ANP infusion (ANP group). Forty patients were blindly paired in two groups of 20 according to the duration of cold ischemia time (mean +\/- 2 h). The demographic characteristics of donors and recipients were similar. Using a Swan-Ganz catheter, hemodynamic parameters were monitored for 4 h after transplantation. The group receiving ANP and moderate hydration was perfused to a mean pulmonary arterial pressure (PAP) of < or = 20 mmHg. The PAP in patients receiving MH was driven to > or = 25 mmHg. In the ANP group, a bolus of 100 micrograms of ANP was infused into the graft's renal artery at the time of unclamping, followed by 24 h of continuous intravenous infusion at 0.03 microgram\/kg\/min. Thereafter, the patients received ANP at a rate of 0.01 microgram\/kg\/min until the serum creatinine reached < 2 mg\/dl. As a consequence of the hydration regimen, the PAP at unclamping was lower in the ANP group than in the control group; 20 +\/- 3 and 26 +\/- 4 mmHg, respectively (p < 0.05). The ANP plasma levels were significantly higher during the first 3 d in the ANP group (p < 0.001). The median recovery rate of renal function was similar in both groups. No patients in the ANP group experienced ATN while 4 patients (20%) in the control group did (p = 0.125). The need for hemodialysis was markedly reduced in the ANP group compared to the control group (1 ANP-treated patient required dialysis once whereas 5 patients from the control group underwent dialysis a total of 26 times; p = 0.068). ANP administration was well-tolerated and no hypotensive episodes were reported. This preliminary study suggests that ANP infusion is at least as effective as maximal hydration in preventing ATN and represents an efficient alternative for transplantation centers which do not use maximal hydration as a standard regimen in managing kidney allograft recipients.",

        "Abstract":"In a 43-year-old patient with Ebstein's anomaly and a history of acute myocardial infarction by means of duplex ultrasonography and aortography the diagnosis of thrombotic occlusion of the a aorta was established, starting above the insertion of the renal arteries and reaching as far as the bifurcation of the aorta and the common iliac arteries. In the clinical picture dominated complete anuria with uraemia and marked hyperkaliaemia as a result of ischaemic affection of the extremities due to thrombosis of the aorta; at the onset of hospitalization also left ventricular failure with hyperhydration and later also signs of the hyperviscous syndrome. The latter developed after repeated haemofiltrations which led to a rise of the originally high haemoglobin and haemotocrit values a result of a righ-left shunt in Ebstein's anomaly. After improvement of the clinical condition local fibrinolytic treatment of the aortal thrombosis with urokinase (total dose 2,160,000 u. administered within 24 hours) was provided. The thrombus with a total length of 13.5 cm was dissolved except for a residual portion of 10 mm located in the area of insertion of the right renal artery. After dissolution of the thrombus it proved possible to restore the blood flow into the left kidney a and lower extremities, but not into the right kidney because of the residual thrombus. Seventy-two hours after terminated fibrinolysis - and after 31 days of anuria - the diuresis was restored and after a polyuric stage normalization of mineral, urea levels was restored and the creatinine value was slightly above the upper normal range. Concurrently with fibrinolytic therapy angioplasty of the aorta was carried out and a stent was placed on the left iliac artery. The clinical condition of the patient was improving, the patient started to mount stairs. Death occurred suddenly and the cause was cardiac failure due to very serious congenital heart disease.",

        "Abstract":"BACKGROUND: Diabetic recipients of kidney transplants have an excessively high risk of allograft loss, infectious complications with sepsis, cardiovascular events and early death. This study was designed in order to determine whether post-transplantation medical management influenced long-term results.\nMETHODS: Seventy consecutive diabetic recipients of cadaveric renal allografts were followed from the time of transplant. Treatment regimens were based on the clinical judgement of transplant nephrologists and surgeons, not by the study team. Patients were followed for 2 to 9 years (mean follow-up of 50.85 months, one lost to follow-up). Groups were classified by HLA match, type of immunosuppression, prior cardiovascular history, type of antihypertensives (36 on calcium channel blockers, 32 on beta blockers, 8 ACE inhibitors). Events were defined as myocardial infarction, CVA, graft loss with return to dialysis, life-threatening sepsis, or death.\nRESULTS: Twenty allografts failed during the study, 24 patients died. Potentially cardioprotective drugs did not impact significantly on cardiac death, MI or CVA. Survivals were better when calcium channel blockers were used (mean 71.7 vs 38.6 months, p < 0.05; 4-year survival 84 vs 58%). When both beta and calcium channel blockers were used (n = 20), patients mean survival was 72.5 months vs 36.8 months for 21 patients who were not treated with blockers (p < 0.005). There was a lower incidence of graft loss when beta blockers and calcium channel blockers were used: at mean patient survival of 36.8 months, the no-blockers group had a mean graft survival of 19.3 months vs 72.5 months for blocker-treated patients (p < 0.002). Reinstitution of dialysis occurred less often with calcium channel blockers (17 vs 42%) or beta blockers (19 vs 38%) used either individually or together (5 vs 42%), all p < 0.05. Calcium channel blocker treated patients had 1\/9 the number of septic deaths, fewer patients had multiple septic episodes, all p < 0.02.\nCONCLUSION: Allograft success and patient survivals may be improved and sepsis related events diminished when diabetic renal allograft recipients are treated with calcium channel blocking agents, plus or minus beta blockers. Considerable savings can be accomplished and graft results with these drugs can approach non-diabetic and live-related transplant results.",

The study group consisted of the ten patients who had a cardiac index < or = 2.5 L\/min\/m2 (while receiving no inotropic medication) immediately after separation from cardiopulmonary bypass.\nINTERVENTIONS AND MEASUREMENTS: Study patients were randomly given a starting dose of either 5 micrograms\/kg\/min of dobutamine (n = 5) or 2 micrograms\/kg\/min of dopexamine (n = 5). During the initial 30 min following separation from bypass, dosages were titrated incrementally to maintain cardiac index > or = 3.0\/L\/min\/m2. Further titrations of the drug were done only if cardiac index fell below 3.0 L\/min\/m2 or if sustained tachycardia occurred during the 24-h study period. Data were collected at 5- and 10-min intervals for the first 30 min after separation from bypass, hourly for the next 8 h, then every 2 h for the remainder of the study period.\nRESULTS: Both drugs increased cardiac index by more than 50 percent over baseline (dobutamine 2.2 +\/- 0.1 to 3.5 +\/- 0.2 [p < 0.05]; dopexamine, 2.3 +\/- 0.1 to 3.5 +\/- 0.1 [p < 0.05] L\/min\/m2).

        "Abstract":"Arrhythmias are very common after cardiac surgery and are multifactorial. Magnesium is receiving increased consideration in the management of supraventricular and ventricular arrhythmias. This study was designed to evaluate the role of magnesium in preventing arrhythmias in hypokalemic (K < 3.5 mEq\/L) and normokalemic (K > 3.5 mEq\/L) patients with normal renal and ventricular function after coronary artery bypass grafting (CABG). One hundred forty patients ranging from 32 to 71 years of age who were scheduled for CABG were studied. They were divided into four groups: group I (control) received no magnesium; group II received 10 mg\/kg of magnesium sulfate intravenously before cardiopulmonary bypass (CPB); group III received 10 mg\/kg of magnesium soon after CPB; group IV received 10 mg\/kg of magnesium before and after CPB. Serum potassium and catecholamine levels, as well as serum and urine magnesium levels, were measured and the incidence and type of arrhythmias were determined. There was a statistically significant difference in the occurrence of arrhythmias between the groups studied. The incidence of arrhythmias was highest in groups I and II and lowest in group IV (12 patients in group I, 14 in group II, 5 in group III; and 1 in group IV). Magnesium levels were higher in group IV than any other group studied after completion of surgery. There was no difference in serum and urine magnesium levels between the hypokalemic and normokalemic patients within each group. Serum magnesium returned to normal in all patients after 48 hours. Therefore, it appears that administration of magnesium during and after cardiac surgery reduces the incidence of arrhythmias in hypokalemic and normokalemic patients.",

The results obtained show that rh-SOD exerts a beneficial effect on acute rejection events as indicated by a significant reduction of (1) first acute rejection episodes from 33.3% in controls to 18.5%, as well as (2) early irreversible acute rejection from 12.5% in controls to 3.7%. With regard to long-term results, there was a significant improvement of the actual 4-year graft survival rate in rh-SOD-treated patients to 74% (with a projected half-life of 15 years) compared with 52% in controls (with an extrapolated half-life of 5 years). The beneficial effect of rh-SOD observed in this trial is not fully understood, although one can assume that the effect is related to its antioxidant action on ischemia\/reperfusion injury of the renal allograft, thereby potentially reducing the immunogenicity of the graft. In addition and in accordance with the \"response-to-injury hypothesis\" in the pathogenesis of general atherosclerosis, rh-SOD has the potential to mitigate free radical-mediated reperfusion injury-induced acute endothelial cell damage that potentially may contribute to the process of chronic obliterative rejection arteriosclerosis.",

        "Abstract":"Thirty-five male patients undergoing coronary artery surgery were studied to investigate renal function during a continuous infusion of the calcium channel blocker diltiazem. All patients had preoperative renal function within normal limits (serum creatinine below 0.133 mmol\/L) and were randomly divided into three groups: Control (C), Diltiazem 1 (D1), and Diltiazem 2 (D2). Diltiazem was infused in D1 (1 microgram\/kg\/min) and D2 (2 micrograms\/kg\/min) patients throughout surgery and during the following 36 hours. Glomerular function was investigated using the endogenous creatinine clearance while tubular function was assessed by means of water and sodium reabsorption tests, as well as urinary enzyme activity measurements. Hemodynamic monitoring was performed using a pulmonary artery catheter. The glomerular filtration rate of C and D1 patients showed a significant fall during cardiopulmonary bypass (CPB) with respect to the prebypass period and returned to the baseline values only in the postoperative period. A similar change was not observed in D2 patients. The analysis of variance demonstrated that the glomerular filtration rate was significantly higher in Group D2 versus Group C during and after CPB (P = 0.03 and P = 0.04, respectively). Furthermore, after CPB, urinary output was significantly improved in D2 patients, both versus C and D1 patients (P = 0.003), notwithstanding a lower mean arterial pressure in the D2 Group (P = 0.04 v C Group). Tubular function was not influenced by diltiazem infusion. It is concluded that a continuous diltiazem infusion, at a dose of 2 micrograms\/kg\/min during cardiac surgery, may be useful to prevent a decrease in glomerular function secondary to cardiopulmonary bypass.",

        "Abstract":"In the early postoperative period after coronary artery bypass surgery, arterial hypertension commonly occurs which requires intravenous vasodilator therapy. Purine adenosine is a potent vasodilator and when exogenously administered it decreases systemic arterial blood pressure effectively. We evaluated the effects of adenosine on central hemodynamics and renal function when used to control postoperative hypertension after coronary artery bypass grafting (CABG). Two separate series of experiments were performed postoperatively in the Intensive Care Unit (ICU). In the first study (n = 10), postoperative hypertension was controlled in the rewarming phase, with sodium nitroprusside (SNP, 1.7 +\/- 0.4 micrograms.kg-1 x min-1) or adenosine (147.2 +\/- 38.9 micrograms.kg-1 x min-1) to keep mean arterial systolic pressure at approximately 80 mm Hg. In the second study on a separate group of patients (n = 9), low doses of adenosine (0, 30, 60, 90, and 0 micrograms.kg-1 x min-1) were infused when the patients were normotensive and rewarmed. Central hemodynamics, urine flow (UF), renal blood flow (RBF), glomerular filtration rate (GFR), and ECG were evaluated during periods of 30 min for each drug in the first study and during each dose of adenosine in the second study. RBF and GFR were determined using standard urinary clearance methods for 51Cr-ethylenediaminetetraacetic acid and p-aminohippuric acid. In the first study, adenosine infusion, compared to SNP, decreased (A - V)O2, increased central filling pressures and heart rate, and caused a more pronounced ST segment depression. During adenosine administration RBF (-44%), GFR (-52%), and UF (-76%) decreased, while renal vascular resistance and filtration fraction (FF) were unaltered compared to data obtained during SNP infusion.(ABSTRACT TRUNCATED AT 250 WORDS)",

        "Abstract":"Insulin-dependent diabetic patients found to have substantial coronary artery disease at the time of assessment for renal transplantation have 2-year survival of less than 50%. Because most of these patients have no angina symptoms their management is controversial. We tried to find out whether coronary artery revascularisation in such patients might decrease the combined incidence of unstable angina, myocardial infarction, and cardiac death. 151 consecutive insulin-dependent diabetic candidates for renal transplantation underwent coronary angiography. 31 had stenoses greater than 75% in one or more coronary arteries, atypical chest pain or no chest pain, and a left ventricular ejection fraction greater than 0.35. Of these, 26 agreed to be randomly assigned medical treatment (a calcium-channel-blocking drug plus aspirin) or revascularisation (angioplasty or coronary bypass surgery). 10 of 13 medically managed and 2 of 13 revascularised patients had a cardiovascular endpoint within a median of 8.4 months of coronary angiography (p < 0.01). 4 medically managed patients died of myocardial infarction during follow-up. Thus, revascularisation decreased the frequency of cardiac events in insulin-dependent diabetic patients with chronic renal failure and symptomless coronary artery stenoses. These findings suggest that diabetic renal transplant candidates should be screened for silent coronary artery disease, because revascularisation may decrease cardiac morbidity and mortality in this population.",

The annual incidence was 22 cases per million population. Twenty-two cases had pre-existing cardiac disease, mainly valvular disease-usually rheumatic (nine cases) and prosthetic valves (10 cases). Recognizable precipitants such as recent surgery were uncommon. Two cases presented after deliberate drug overdose possibly due to depression exacerbated by systemic disease. Symptoms were usually non-specific. All but two cases had murmurs and most were pyrexial. Splinter haemorrhages and clubbing were seen in about 20% of cases. Viridans-type streptococci were the commonest infecting organisms (14 cases). Staphylococcal infection (six cases) was confined to intravenous drug abusers and patients with prosthetic valves. Five cases were culture negative. Cardiac failure was present in 13 cases at presentation and developed in seven others during treatment. Acute valve replacement was necessary in eight cases, and late replacement in three. Renal impairment (plasma urea > 8 mmol\/l and\/or plasma creatinine > 120 mumol\/l) occurred in 19 cases during the course of their illness. Embolic phenomena occurred in 12 patients and mostly involved the central nervous system. In the 8 fatal cases, the cause of death was cardiac failure in six, cerebrovascular accident in one, and myocardial infarction in one. Four of the six patients who subsequently died of cardiac failure had been referred for surgery. Both those who were not referred had coexisting medical problems. Factors associated with increased mortality were age, male sex, cardiac failure (P < 0.01), renal impairment (P < 0.05), and embolic phenomena (P < 0.01).(ABSTRACT TRUNCATED AT 250 WORDS)",

        "Abstract":"STUDY OBJECTIVE: To evaluate renal and vasodilator effects of synthetic atrial natriuretic factor (ANF) in patients undergoing cardiopulmonary bypass (CPB) with special reference to the applicability of ANF as a diuretic and natriuretic.\nDESIGN: The study consisted of two parts. The first 15 consecutive patients in a university hospital received a pharmacologically effective bolus dose of 100 micrograms ANF, as demonstrated previously in other studies, or placebo. After analysis of the bolus data (see \"Results\" section below), the 12 subsequent patients were administered ANF 50 micrograms as a constant 30-min infusion at a rate of 1.67 micrograms\/min or placebo.\nPATIENTS: The patients were scheduled for elective coronary artery bypass grafting operation. There was no evidence of congestive heart failure in any patient, and no one had an endocrine or renal disorder.\nINTERVENTIONS: After achievement of hypothermia (29 to 30 degrees C of rectal temperature) during CPB, a bolus dose of ANF 100 micrograms was given or an infusion of ANF 1.67 micrograms\/min for 30 min, ie, a total dose of 50 micrograms was started. The control patients received placebo correspondingly. Intravenous fluids were administered according to a predetermined scheme.\nMEASUREMENTS AND MAIN RESULTS: For the pharmacologic effects of ANF urine volume, urinary sodium excretion and mean arterial pressure (MAP) were measured. Only three of the eight patients receiving the bolus dose of ANF had a diuretic and natriuretic response to the drug, and the responses were significantly related (r = 0.91, p less than 0.05 and r = 0.98, p less than 0.001, respectively) to the prevailing MAP at the time of the bolus administration. The bolus dose of ANF decreased MAP significantly (p less than 0.001 vs placebo) from 65 +\/- 6 (mean +\/- SEM) to 55 +\/- 6 mm Hg within 5 min. The infusion of ANF did not affect MAP, but it increased urine output (16.1 +\/- 5.0 ml\/min, when the data obtained during the 30-min infusion and a 30-min period after the infusion were combined) and urinary sodium excretion (1,651 +\/- 514 microEq\/min) significantly (p less than 0.05 and p less than 0.01, respectively) as compared with the corresponding values of 3.3 +\/- 1.1 ml\/min and 386 +\/- 141 microEq\/min after placebo.\nCONCLUSIONS: Prevailing arterial pressure is an important determinant of the diuretic and natriuretic activity of synthetic ANF in patients undergoing CPB. A low-dose infusion of ANF (50 micrograms within 30 min) provides diuresis and natriuresis without significant changes in MAP in these patients.",

        "Published":null,
        "Abstract":"As a result of the AIDS crisis, public and physician pressure have increased the utilization of autologous blood products. Attitudes about homologous blood transfusion, however, have changed dramatically in recent years. A large segment of the population undergoing elective surgery is elderly and therefore has a significant incidence of cardiovascular disease and a slow response of the erythropoietic system when acute anemia occurs. However, preoperative autologous blood donation programs require 2-5 weeks to complete; the average yield is only 2.2 units per patient. As a consequence, autologous predonation is underused and homologous transfusion cannot be completely avoided in all patients. For several years recombinant human erythropoietin (rHuEPO) has been available and has been successfully used in the treatment of patients with renal anemia. This study evaluated the effect of r-HuEPO on patients with preoperative autologous blood collection. METHODS. Ten patients of both sexes scheduled for hip arthroplasty underwent a preoperative autologous program. During a period of 23 days prior to surgery autologous blood donation was performed with 7.5 ml\/kg withdrawal on four occasions, the last one 5 days prior to surgery. Five patients were randomly treated with subcutaneous injections of rHuEPO (Erypo, Cilag GmbH, Sulzbach; Distributor: Fresenius AG, Oberursel, FRG) 200 IU\/kg seven times, starting 3 days after the first blood withdrawal. All patients (n = 10) received oral iron therapy with iron sulphate 304 mg\/die (= 100 mg iron\/die). Patients with hypertension or recent myocardial infarction were excluded from the study. The hemoglobin level before donation had to be at least 11.0 g\/dl. On each study day, a complete blood count and platelets, differential, and reticulocyte count were determined by standard methods as were transferrin, ferritin, and total iron-binding capacity. Blood loss and blood consumption during and after the operation were registered. The indication for blood transfusion (autologous\/homologous) was based on hemoglobin values, which were not acceptable below 8.5 g\/dl. RESULTS. No side effects of rHuEPO treatment were observed. Blood loss ranged from 650 to 1100 ml intraoperatively and 400 to 950 ml postoperatively with no differences between the groups. Patients with rHuEPO had no autologous red cell concentrates (aRCC) during the operation; two of them had two units of aRCC on the 2nd postoperative day. Two of the patients in the control group had intraoperative blood transfusions (2 and 3 units aRCC, respectively); all patients in this group were transfused postoperatively: 12 of the 20 units collected were utilized. At the onset of the operation the mean hemoglobin value in patients with rHuEPO was 13.5 +\/- 0.4 g\/dl compared to 11.3 +\/- 0.3 g\/dl in the controls. Reticulocytes increased significantly during the investigation period. On the 2nd, 3rd, and 4th days of autologous blood collection and before the onset of surgery, the number of reticulocytes was significantly greater in rHuEPO patients than in the controls. Further laboratory variables such as transferrin, ferritin, and total iron-binding capacity did not change significantly during the investigation period; there were no significant differences between the two groups. DISCUSSION. The results of the present study show that rHuEPO leads to an increase in reticulocytes with maintenance of hemoglobin levels during the phlebotomy program. As a consequence, patients with anemia and particular contraindications to homologous blood derivatives (irregular antibodies, Jehovah's Witnesses) may be able to undergo major surgery successfully. The possibility of shortening the intervals between phlebotomies would seem to be of major advantage; our data also suggest that an aggressive autologous blood collection program would increase yields over present programs. In our institute a minimum hemoglobin level of 11.5 g\/dl is accepted for autologous donation.(ABSTRACT TRUNCATED AT 400 WORDS)",

Patients entered the study when hypokalemia (potassium less than 3.5 mmol\/L) was noted on routine laboratory blood analysis. Most common primary diagnoses on ICU admission included postoperative cardiac surgery (n = 9), sepsis and multiple organ system failure (n = 9), complicated myocardial infarction (n = 7), and respiratory failure (n = 5).\nINTERVENTION: Potassium chloride infusions (20, 30, or 40 mmol in 100 mL normal saline over 1 hr) were administered to patients for serum potassium levels of less than 3.5 but greater than 3.2 mmol\/L (n = 26), 3.0 to 3.2 mmol\/L (n = 11), and less than 3.0 mmol\/L (n = 11), respectively. Serum and urine potassium levels were monitored during and for 1 hr after the infusion.\nMEASUREMENTS AND RESULTS: All patients tolerated the infusions without evidence of hemodynamic compromise, ECG change, or new dysrhythmia requiring treatment. The mean maximum potassium increase was 0.5 +\/- 0.3 mmol\/L, 0.9 +\/- 0.4 mmol\/L, and 1.1 +\/- 0.4 mmol\/L in the 20-, 30-, and 40-mmol groups, respectively. The increase in serum potassium was maximal at the completion of the infusion and was significant (p less than .05) compared with baseline in all groups. Peak potassium levels were the same in patients with normal renal function (n = 33) compared with those with renal insufficiency (n = 15). Urinary excretion of potassium increased in all groups during the infusion and was significant (p less than .05) in the 30- and 40-mmol groups, but was no greater in those patients who had received diuretics (n = 8) compared with those patients who had not (n = 40).\nCONCLUSIONS: In the select group of hypokalemic patients studied, potassium infusions of 20 to 40 mmol delivered over 1 hr were safe to administer and effectively increased serum potassium levels in a dose-dependent and predictable fashion. Furthermore, these results were independent of the patient's underlying renal function or associated diuretic administration.",

In an initial dose ranging study, successive groups of six kidneys (3 pairs) were randomized to receive each of 0.0125, 0.025, 0.05 micrograms\/kg\/min AP-3 or placebo. Thereafter 20 kidneys (10 pairs) received 0.1 micrograms\/kg\/min or placebo. There was no discernable effect of AP-3 on allograft creatinine clearance or sodium excretion either when the highest dose of AP-3 was considered alone or when all doses were considered together. Averaged creatinine clearance over the period 0 to 24 hours after transplantation was 20.1 +\/- 14.7 ml\/min in patients receiving active treatment and 18.2 +\/- 13.7 ml\/min in those receiving placebo. Thus, despite the documentation of a protective effect of atrial natriuretic factor in animal models of renal ischemia, it is unlikely that intravenous infusion of AP-3 in this dose range will be of benefit in improving immediate renal allograft graft function.",

Five patients had abdominal aneurysm, 12 had aortic obstruction disease, and three had aortic renal bypass surgery. These patients were followed for 1 month.\nINTERVENTIONS: Pulmonary artery occlusion pressure of at least 10 mm Hg and a urine output greater than 30 mL\/h were used to guide the intraoperative fluid infusion rates, which were 36 and 104 mL\/kg of D60 and RL, respectively (ratio 1:2.9).\nMEASUREMENTS AND MAIN RESULTS: Body weight at 24 hr had increased more with RL (7.8 kg) than with D60 (3.2 kg) infusion (p less than .01), despite intraoperative urine volumes of 151 and 92 mg\/kg with RL and D60, respectively. Total intravascular albumin decreased from 0.7 g\/kg (1.4 to 0.7 g\/kg) in both groups, corresponding to a plasma volume (PV) loss of 13 mg\/kg without fluid infusions.

Twenty-one patients had perioperative central haemodynamic monitoring while 19 patients had central venous pressure monitoring alone. Parameters studied included, perioperative haemodynamics and fluid balance, perioperative cardiac drug administration, operation time and clamp time, postoperative renal function, incidence of postoperative ventilation and line complications, duration of hospital and ICU stay, and 30 day postoperative outcome. Results obtained were compared with a high risk group of patients (LVEF less than 0.50) undergoing similar surgery. Statistical analysis failed to show any difference in outcome for any variable measured in either low risk group. All serious postoperative cardiac complications occurred in patients with LVEF less than 0.50 (P less than 0.0001). These data suggest that patients with LVEF greater than or equal to 0.50 are at low risk of developing postoperative cardiac complications and can be successfully managed perioperatively without the added potential risks and costs of central haemodynamic monitoring.",

This is mainly mediated by a peripheral alpha adrenoceptor blockade with a decrease in systemic vascular resistance. In addition, acute animal experiments demonstrated a centrally mediated hypotensive action, possibly by 5-hydroxytryptamine1A-receptor stimulation. Studies in humans showed an increase in cardiac output, which was not always significant; it resulted either from an increased heart rate or an increased stroke volume. Acute changes in pulmonary hemodynamics after administration of urapidil were most pronounced in patients with pulmonary hypertension: pulmonary artery pressure and pulmonary vascular resistance decreased significantly and pulmonary capillary wedge pressure decreased non-significantly. A small reduction in pulmonary artery pressure and capillary wedge pressure was seen in patients with congestive heart failure and in patients in whom acute blood pressure elevation developed after coronary bypass surgery. In patients with essential hypertension, forearm, renal and splanchnic flows were shown to increase and vascular resistance to decrease significantly after an acute intravenous doses of urapidil.

Patients were allocated randomly to two groups (n = 10) who were treated with incremental doses of either dopexamine 1, 2 and 4 micrograms kg-1 min-1, or dopamine 2.5 and 5 micrograms kg-1 min-1, each dose being maintained for 15 min. Measurements were performed before administration of the drug and at the end of the infusion period at each dose. Fentanyl and midazolam were used as anaesthetic agents. Renal blood flow was measured with the argon washin technique. Dopexamine 4 micrograms kg-1 min-1 produced an increase in cardiac index of 117% caused by a 65% reduction in afterload and an increase in heart rate by 61%. Dopamine 5 micrograms kg-1 min-1 caused a 40% increase in cardiac index as a result of an increase in stroke volume. Renal vascular resistance decreased more than systemic vascular resistance with dopamine. With dopexamine, the increase in renal blood flow (66%) was less than the increase in cardiac index, while renal vascular resistance and systemic vascular resistance declined to almost the same extent. The results show that dopexamine exerts systemic and renal effects mainly via stimulation of beta 2-receptors.

The role of CsA in potentiating these effects is not well understood, but CsA has been implicated in promoting delayed graft function and potentiating renal ischemic injury. In order to establish whether CsA is safely tolerated by kidneys subjected to protracted cold ischemia, we examined patient and graft outcome in a series of 1081 patients receiving cadaver-kidney transplants over an 8-year period (1981-1988). All patients received a standard immunosuppressive regimen that included CsA. Overall actuarial 1-year patient and graft survival rates were 96% and 80%, respectively. Renal preservation was achieved either by pulsatile perfusion (n = 261, 24%) or simple cold storage (n = 820, 76%). Results were analyzed according to total cold ischemic time as follows: 0-23 hr (n = 512; range, 0-23.9 hr); 24-35 hr (n = 380; range, 24.0-35.9 hr); 36-47 hr (n = 161; range, 36.0-47.7 hr); greater than or equal to 48 hr (n = 28; range, 48.0-70.6 hr). These groups did not differ significantly in recipient age, sex, incidence of diabetes, number of pretransplant blood transfusions, level of presensitization, or HLA match. There were no differences in overall actuarial 1-year patient or graft survival rates, incidence of rejection, or renal function at 1 year. There was a higher incidence of impaired early graft function for kidneys preserved greater than or equal to 48 hr, but eventual graft outcome, including serum creatinine at 1 year, was unchanged. Delayed introduction of CsA resulted in improved 1-year graft survival (84.4% vs. 74.7%, P less than 0.05) compared to CsA treatment begun at the time of transplantation (\"initial CsA\"). This improvement was present regardless of total cold ischemia time. The incidence of permanent graft nonfunction, which has been previously reported to increase with CsA therapy, was influenced by the timing of CsA therapy (initial: 12%; delayed: 3%, P less than 0.05) but was not affected by duration of cold ischemia. Thus, safe preservation of cadaver kidneys for up to 70 h can be achieved by standard techniques even when CsA is incorporated into the immunosuppressive regimen. The most important determinants of graft survival in these patients are the timing of CsA therapy and the presence of early graft function, not the duration of renal preservation.",

        "Abstract":"PURPOSE: To determine the prevalence of atherosclerotic renal artery stenosis in patients who have atherosclerosis elsewhere but lack the usual clinical clues to suggest renal artery stenosis.\nPATIENTS AND METHODS: The arteriograms and charts of 395 consecutive patients were prospectively reviewed by a member of the Vascular Medicine Department and a member of the Radiology Department. These patients underwent arteriography as part of the routine evaluation for abdominal aortic aneurysm (109 patients), aorto-occlusive disease (21 patients), lower-extremity occlusive disease (189 patients), and suspected renal artery stenosis (76 patients). Patients in the first three groups did not have the usual clues that suggest renal artery stenosis.\nRESULTS: There was greater than 50% renal artery stenosis in 41 patients (38%) with abdominal aortic aneurysm, seven patients (33%) with aorto-occlusive disease, 74 patients (39%) with lower-extremity occlusive disease, and 53 patients (70%) with suspected renal artery stenosis. The prevalence of renal artery stenosis was similar in diabetic and nondiabetic patients with abdominal aortic aneurysm, aorto-occlusive disease, or suspected renal artery stenosis, but higher in diabetics with lower-extremity occlusive disease (50%) compared to nondiabetics with lower-extremity occlusive disease (33%) (p = 0.022). High-grade bilateral disease was present in approximately 13% of patients with abdominal aortic aneurysm or lower-extremity occlusive disease, and totally occluded renal arteries occurred in 5% of the patients in these groups. There was an association between increasing degree of renal artery stenosis and the presence of hypertension and worsening of renal function.\nCONCLUSION: Patients with atherosclerosis elsewhere, especially abdominal aortic aneurysm, aorto-occlusive disease, or lower-extremity occlusive disease, have a high prevalence of significant renal artery stenosis even in the absence of the usual clues to suspect renal artery stenosis. Diabetic patients have a similar prevalence as nondiabetic patients. This information may have important therapeutic implications in patients being considered for vascular surgery.",

        "Published":null,
        "Abstract":"It has been reported that initial cyclosporine levels over 400 ng\/ml posttransplantation result in an increased incidence of delayed graft function (DGF). Several studies have shown early graft function to be a major determinant for long-term graft survival. Continuous intravenous infusion (CIVI) has been employed to induce immunosuppression establishing therapeutic drug levels while minimizing toxicity in renal allograft recipients. This study examines the impact of the achieved serum CsA steady-state concentration (Css) levels upon transplant outcome in 228 patients given CsA by CIVI. In spite of administration of a specific drug dose, interindividual variation in elimination rates yields a broad range of Css levels. Six groups were stratified by CsA Css levels: group A 0-75 ng\/ml, group B 76-100 ng\/ml, group C 101-150 ng\/ml, group D 151-200 ng\/ml, group E 201-250 ng\/ml, and group F greater than 250 ng\/ml. Group A showed a significantly lower age and greater incidence of rejection at 0-10 days. Group F had significantly higher incidences of nephrotoxicity, hepatotoxicity, and delayed graft function. The findings suggest that the antirejection Css threshold for CsA may be at least 75 ng\/ml, and the toxicity threshold above 250 ng\/ml. Controversy exists about whether CsA influences the incidence of DGF, therefore risk factors for DGF were examined among the groups stratified by CsA Css levels. While cold ischemia time for all 228 patients as a group was highly correlated with DGF (P less than 0.001), neither cold ischemia time nor donor age was significantly different among the groups. There does appear to be a synergistic effect between CsA Css and CIT, since the incidence of DGF was significantly higher when the cold ischemia time was 21-24 hr and CsA Css greater than 200 ng\/ml. Long-term graft function did not appear to be affected by early CsA Css levels. The Css of 100-250 ng\/ml appears to achieve a satisfactory outcome with a 19.5% incidence of rejection within 10 days, 29.7% DGF, and 5.1% nephrotoxicity. Only 118\/228 patients (52%) in this study achieved that range despite a fixed low CIVI of CsA. Thus potential renal allograft recipients may benefit from a pretransplant pharmacokinetic study to predict the proper CIVI dose.",

Our report is based on an analysis of 202 successive transplantations performed in our institution from May 1984 to December 1986, using low-dose CsA as the basic means of immunosuppression. A total of 142 patients received the triple combination CsA, azathioprine (AZA), and corticosteroids. Sixty patients received a prophylactic combination of CsA, corticosteroids, and antilymphocyte globulins (ALG). From January to December 1986, both regimens were compared in a prospective randomized trial. The factors that affect graft survival were analyzed using the Cox multivariate hazard analysis. The relative risks were calculated for pretransplant baseline risk factors and for outcome-dependent post-transplant risk factors for surviving grafts at 1 month. Transplants performed with a prolonged ischemia time and patients whose graft did not function immediately were statistically at higher risk of graft loss. Adding prophylactic ALG to CsA was associated with better graft survival. Patients who experienced more than 1 rejection crisis and patients whose 1-month CsA dose was lower than or equal to 5 mg\/kg per day were also at significantly higher risk of further graft loss. Neither HLA matching, peak panel reactivity, age of the recipient, occurrence of post-transplant renal dysfunction nor 1-month renal function affected the short-term graft outcome.",

        "Abstract":"To determine whether specific antiplatelet therapies improved vein graft patency after coronary artery bypass grafting (CABG) we compared (1) aspirin, 325 mg daily, (2) aspirin, 325 mg three times daily, (3) aspirin plus dipyridamole (325 mg and 75 mg, respectively, three times daily), (4) sulfinpyrazone (267 mg three times daily), and (5) placebo (three times daily). Therapy, except aspirin, was started 48 hr before CABG. When aspirin was a treatment, one 325 mg dose was given 12 hr before surgery and therapy was maintained thereafter according to the assigned regimen. Angiographic graft patency data were obtained within 60 days of surgery. Analysis of early graft patency in 555 patients (1781 grafts), revealed the following graft patency rates: aspirin daily, 93.5%; aspirin three times daily, 92.3%; aspirin and dipyridamole, 91.9%; and sulfinpyrazone, 90.2%. All aspirin-containing therapeutic regimens improved (p less than .05) graft patency compared with placebo (85.2%). Chest tube drainage measured within the first 35 hr after CABG revealed that the median loss with aspirin daily (965 ml), aspirin three times daily (1175 ml), and aspirin plus dipyridamole (1000 ml) exceeded (p less than .02) that with placebo (805 ml), while median loss with sulfinpyrazone (775 ml) did not. The reoperation rate was greater (p less than .01) in all the treatment groups that received aspirin (6.5%) compared with the two nonaspirin groups (1.7%). Overall operative mortality was 2.3%, without significant differences among treatment groups. Transient renal insufficiency occurred in 5.3% of patients taking sulfinpyrazone. Thus, early vein graft patency was improved after CABG with all aspirin-containing drug regimens.(ABSTRACT TRUNCATED AT 250 WORDS)",

Urinary excretion of prostaglandin E2 (PGE2) was significantly decreased (p less than 0.01) during ASA treatment; in the SP group, urinary PGE2 excretion tended also to decrease during the first days of treatment, the decrease being significant only on the 4th day (p less than 0.01). The urinary excretion of kallikrein decreased significantly only in the SP group (p less than 0.01), while the changes in the ASA and placebo group were not significant.

Patients with severe ischemia or those with simple localized occlusion were best treated by surgical means. Successful thrombolysis was also obtained with renal artery occlusions combined with percutaneous transluminal angioplasty. The management of patients with prosthetic graft occlusion by lytic therapy is complex. Optimal results can be obtained in patients presenting with occluded grafts after the immediate postoperative period and in those in whom previous satisfactory runoff has been demonstrated.

In group 2 patients, lysis was achieved in eight of 16 patients in whom lytic therapy was instituted within seven days of graft closure. There was no lysis in all ten patients in whom elapsed time was more than seven days. Postlytic angiographic visualization of etiologic mechanisms for thrombosis enabled subsequent successful correction in three of five patients in group 2. Attempts to correct graft failure by surgical treatment when lysis had failed were often unsuccessful (12 of 17). Lytic therapy is most effective for acute embolic occlusion and for thrombosis of less than seven days duration. Although there is no difference in drug efficacy by route of administration, a lesser number of complications (such as, fever and hematoma) occurred with intra-arterial infusion. The effectiveness of lysis is also directly related to the collateral circulation and runoff beyond the occlusion. Lysis is not indicated for severe acute ischemia if surgical treatment is an alternative or if it may cause distal embolism as with complete axillofemoral graft thrombosis.

        "Abstract":"Situations requiring immediate lowering of systemic blood pressure are infrequent. Certain clinical syndromes resulting from or complicated by severe hypertension demand vigorous, usually parenteral, antihypertensive therapy. Such syndromes include (1) diastolic hypertension accompanied by sudden disruption of cerebral function, (2) dissecting or leaking aortic aneurysm; (3) accelerated or malignant hypertension, (4) toxemia of pregnancy when either the fetus' or the mother's life is immediately threatened, (5) some instances of diastolic hypertension and acute left ventricular failure, (6) uncontrolled hypertension in the patient who requires emergency surgery, (7) refractory elevation of the diastolic pressure in the kidney transplant patient, and (8) refractory hypertension complicating myocardial infarction or angina. Drugs useful in acutely lowering blood pressure include diazoxide, sodium nitroprusside, methyldopa intravenously, reserpine intramuscularly, and trimethaphan camsylate intravenously. Use of furosemide reinforces the hypotensive effect of these agents. Theoretical advantages and disadvantages of these agents are not always encountered in clinical use.",

        "Published":null,
        "Abstract":"Although acute renal artery occlusion is luckily a rare event, many cases are probably overlooked. They are caused either by emboli, accidents or iatrogenic vascular injury. The conventional wisdom holds that the kidney is irreversibly damaged by arterial obstruction lasting several hours, but clinical experience shows that there are exceptions to this rule. How this is to be explained from the pathophysiologic viewpoint is discussed in this article. Recognition of acute renal artery occlusion is easiest and fastest in iatrogenic cases. In trauma due to accidents, useful pointers are hematuria, site and intensity of the injuring force and concomitant lesions. Emboli do not give rise to specific symptoms and are most to be suspected in cases prone to embolism. It is helpful to subdivide renal artery occlusions into two groups, one with and the other without mural lesionsof the artery. The outlook is a priori considerably better in cases with intact vascular wall. Here, i.e. in the presence of fresh or recent thrombo-embolic occlusion, surgery is most likely to prove successful, but conservative management alone is known to afford good results too. A differentiated approach to treatment is outlined. Severe vascular trauma may confront the surgeon with virtually insoluble problems, but the conditions under which surgical intervention is nonetheless recommended are defined. Generally the presence of a normal conttalateral kidney will lessen the need for surgical action. Surgery is however mandatory in the none too rare case of bilateral renal artery occlusion or when a solitary kidney is affected. In these cases in-situ perfusion combined with organ cooling, explantation, reconstructive surgery extra vivum and heterotopic re-implantation (for instance into the pelvis) is a most promising procedure.",
