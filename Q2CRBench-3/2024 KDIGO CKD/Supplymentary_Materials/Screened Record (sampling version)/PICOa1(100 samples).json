        "Abstract":"PURPOSE: We report our experience relative to transcatheter percutaneous embolization of post-biopsy renal intraparenchymal arteriovenous fistulas in patients with chronic renal insufficiency.\nMATERIAL AND METHODS: We observed 5 patients affected with post-bioptic fistulas for possible embolization. In three cases the symptoms were represented by intermittent macro-microhematuria; one patient had hypertension of nephrovascular origin and one patient was asymptomatic. In all cases we performed angiography and it was possible to catheterize the peripheral afferent branch of the fistula with a superselective technique using a hydrophilic guide of 0.035 F and a hydrophilic Cobra catheter of 4-5 F. The occlusion was obtained by the positioning of Granturco metal coils: in 1 case we adapted a coil of 3 mm diameter and 1 cm length; in 3 cases 2 coils of 3 mm and in 1 case 2 coils of 3 mm and 1 coil of 5 mm diameter and 1 cm length were necessary. The success of the procedure was always checked with an immediate angiogram and color Doppler US after 48 hrs.\nRESULTS: The diagnosis of arteriovenous fistulas was always confirmed by a preliminary angiography that demonstrated the normal anatomic disposition of the renal arteries except in one case in which the fistula was fed by a peripheral branch originating from an inferior polar artery. All the lesions were localized in the inferior pole, the site of biopsy, and ranged from 3 mm to 2.5 cm in diameter. We never had any difficulties in the positioning and placement of the coils. The arterial occlusion and exclusion of the fistula was accomplished in all cases. The induced parenchymal loss ranged from 10 to 30% of the renal volume. There was a complete disappearance of symptoms in 3 of the patients, with hematuria without any modification of the blood pressure values in the patient with hypertension. Considering the patient status renal function did not worsen after the embolization. Each patient was followed-up with color Doppler US every two months.\nCONCLUSIONS: The intrarenal arteriovenous fistula represents a relative frequent complication of renal needle biopsy in patients with arterial hypertension and nephroangiosclerosis as risk factors. Embolization is a valid alternative therapeutic option to surgical treatments. The use of small size catheters permits the successful embolization also of peripheral lesions, reducing the induced parenchymal ischemia. We believe that among the embolization material available metal coils represent a valid solution as they are easily positioned and permit definitive occlusion without any risks of systemic venous microembolization.",

        "Abstract":"BACKGROUND: Exostosin 1\/2 (EXT1\/2) and neural cell adhesion molecule 1 (NCAM1) associated membranous lupus nephritis (MLN) may represent distinct disease phenotypes with prognostic significance.\nMETHODS: We searched our archives for patients with systemic lupus erythematous (SLE) and at least two kidney biopsies demonstrating MLN. Each biopsy was stained for EXT1 and NCAM1 and scored as positive or negative. Histopathologic and clinical data were reviewed.\nRESULTS: We identified 31 patients with a clinical diagnosis of SLE and at least two kidney biopsies with MLN. A total of 28 patients (90%) showed concordant staining for EXT1 and NCAM1 in both biopsies; 8 patients (26%) were EXT1 positive and NCAM1 negative, 18 patients (58%) were EXT1 negative and NCAM1 negative and 2 patients (7%) were EXT1 negative and NCAM1 positive. A total of three patients (10%) had discordant EXT1 staining between their first and last biopsies; two patients (7%) were EXT1 positive in their first biopsy and EXT1 negative in the last biopsy and one patient (3%) was EXT1 negative in his first biopsy and EXT1 positive in the last biopsy. Compared with the EXT1-negative cohort at the time of the first biopsy, the EXT1-positive cohort had a higher average estimated glomerular filtration rate (eGFR; 141 versus 108 mL\/min\/1.73 m2; P = 0.04), lower average percent global glomerulosclerosis (0.5 versus 12%; P = 0.05), lower average interstitial fibrosis and tubular atrophy (2.5 versus 11.7%; P = 0.06) and lower average total National Institutes of Health (NH) chronicity scores (0.75 versus 2.33; P = 0.05). On long-term follow-up, the rate of change in eGFR did not significantly differ between the two groups (P = 0.24). One EXT1-positive patient (12.5%) developed stage 4 chronic kidney disease (CKD) or end-stage kidney disease (ESKD) compared with four patients (20%) in the EXT-negative group and two of the three EXT1-discordant patients (P = 0.38).\nCONCLUSIONS: We performed the largest retrospective repeat-biopsy study to evaluate EXT1 and NCAM1 autoantigens in MLN. Our data demonstrate that EXT1 positivity is associated with better kidney function at the time of diagnosis and raises the possibility that EXT1 status may change throughout the disease course of MLN.",

We describe a large series of children with biopsy-proven TIN.\nMETHODS: All children with biopsy-proven TIN presenting to our institution during a 23-year period were retrospectively reviewed for aetiology, symptoms, treatment, and long-term outcome.\nRESULTS: A total of 27 children (16 girls) were described. Median age was 12 years (range 8 months to 15 years). A potentially adverse drug reaction was found in 12 (44 %) and infection in 8 (30 %). In 13 (48 %) no initiating factor was identified. All but 1 patient were treated with corticosteroids owing to worsening kidney function and 4 patients with other immunosuppressive agents. Fifteen children (56 %) had an estimated glomerular filtration rate (eGFR) of less than 80 ml\/min\/1.73 m(2) at last follow-up. Fifteen of the 23 children investigated (65 %) had coexistent uveitis.\nCONCLUSION: This series represents a subset of paediatric TIN patients in whom there was a clinical indication for a renal biopsy, hence presenting with more severe disease than previously reported. This group were more likely to have no identifiable underlying cause and an increased requirement for corticosteroid treatment. Furthermore, more than half of the cases developed chronic kidney disease (CKD) with impaired kidney function.",

        "Abstract":"Clinical variables and laboratory and histologic findings were evaluated in 53 children with IgA nephropathy, of whom 44 were followed for a mean period of 6.2 years (range 1.2-14). At the end of the follow-up 8 patients (18.2%) had had no urinary anomalies for at least 1 year (stage A disease), 28 (63.6%) had microscopic hematuria with proteinuria < 1 g\/m2\/day (stage B), 5 (11.4%) had proteinuria > 1 g\/m2\/day (stage C), and 3 (6.8%) had chronic renal insufficiency (stage D). None of the patients in apparent remission presented with elevated serum IgA levels at disease onset. Gross or microscopic hematuria at onset correlated with stage A\/B disease at the end of follow-up (p < .05) whereas the presence of proteinuria or nephritic syndrome at onset correlated with stage C\/D disease after follow-up (p > .05). Presenting features of gross or microscopic hematuria without or with proteinuria (< 0.5 g\/m2\/day) correlated (p < .001) with minimal glomerular abnormalities at biopsy, whereas patients with nephritic syndrome had more severe histologic pictures. The presence of proliferative glomerulonephritis with crescents correlated (p < .0001) with poor outcome. The results demonstrate that the prognosis of IgA nephropathy in childhood must be viewed with caution and that outcome correlates with mode of onset and severity of the renal pathology.",

        "Published":"2020-03-06",
        "Abstract":"BACKGROUND: Interstitial fibrosis (IF) on kidney biopsy is one of the most potent risk factors for kidney disease progression. The furosemide stress test (FST) is a validated tool that predicts the severity of acute kidney injury (especially at 2 h) in critically ill patients. Since furosemide is secreted through the kidney tubules, the response to FST represents the tubular secretory capacity. To our knowledge there is no data on the correlation between functional tubular capacity assessed by the FST with IF on kidney biopsies from patients with chronic kidney disease (CKD). The aim of this study was to determine the association between urine output (UO), Furosemide Excreted Mass (FEM) and IF on kidney biopsies after a FST.\nMETHODS: This study included 84 patients who underwent kidney biopsy for clinical indications and a FST. The percentage of fibrosis was determined by morphometry technique and reviewed by a nephropathologist. All patients underwent a FST prior to the biopsy. Urine volume and urinary sodium were measured in addition to urine concentrations of furosemide at different times (2, 4 and 6 h). We used an established equation to determine the FEM. Values were expressed as mean, standard deviation or percentage and Pearson Correlation.\nRESULTS: The mean age of the participants was 38 years and 44% were male. The prevalence of diabetes mellitus, hypertension and diuretic use was significantly higher with more advanced degree of fibrosis. Nephrotic syndrome and acute kidney graft dysfunction were the most frequent indications for biopsy. eGFR was inversely related to the degree of fibrosis. Subjects with the highest degree of fibrosis (grade 3) showed a significant lower UO at first hour of the FST when compared to lower degrees of fibrosis (p = 0.015). Likewise, the total UO and the FEM was progressively lower with higher degrees of fibrosis. An inversely linear correlation between FEM and the degree of fibrosis (r = - 0.245, p = 0.02) was observed.\nCONCLUSIONS: Our findings indicate that interstitial fibrosis correlates with total urine output and FEM. Further studies are needed to determine if UO and FST could be a non-invasive tool to evaluate interstitial fibrosis.\nTRIAL REGISTRATION: ClinicalTrials.gov NCT02417883.",

Of these, 83 children (90%) had proliferative lupus nephritis (LN) (Class III\/IV ± V). Mycophenolate was used for induction in 36%, whereas 34% received cyclophosphamide (CYC); 55% received mycophenolate as maintenance immunosuppression. The rates of complete remission (CR) and partial remission (PR) at 6 months and 12 months, respectively, were 65% and 20% and 78% and 8%. Two patients died (mortality rate 2.1\/1000 patient-years), with a standardized mortality ratio of 22.3. Three patients (3.2%) developed end-stage kidney disease (ESKD), and advanced CKD occurred in 5 patients (5.4%). Survival rates without advanced CKD, ESKD, or death were 96.7%, 94.2%, 92.7%, 83.2% and 83.2% at 1 year, 5 years, 10 years, 15 years, and 20 years, respectively. Multivariate analysis revealed that severe kidney failure necessitating dialysis at presentation (adjusted hazard ratio 37.7, 95% confidence interval [CI] 4.0-355.6,  = 0.002), nonresponse (NR) after 12 months of treatment (adjusted hazard ratio 11.2, 95% CI 2.3-54.9,  = 0.003), and multiple nephritis flares (adjusted hazard ratio 2.6, 95% CI 1.1-6.2,  = 0.03) were predictive of advanced CKD, ESKD, or death. Other adverse outcomes included infections (2.9 episodes\/100 patient-years), osteopenia (32%), hypertension (17%), short stature (14%), and avascular necrosis (7%).\nCONCLUSION: The long-term outcomes of cLN appeared to have improved in the present era with effective immunosuppression, cautious drug tapering, and assurance of medication adherence. There is still an unacceptably high prevalence of adverse outcomes.",

        "Abstract":"One of the strongest prognostic predictors of chronic kidney disease is interstitial fibrosis and tubular atrophy (IFTA). The ultimate goal of IFTA calculation is an estimation of the functional nephritic area. However, the clinical gold standard of estimation by pathologist is imprecise, primarily due to the overwhelming number of tubules sampled in a standard kidney biopsy. Artificial intelligence algorithms could provide significant benefit in this aspect as their high-throughput could identify and quantitatively measure thousands of tubules in mere minutes. Towards this goal, we use a custom panoptic convolutional network similar to Panoptic-DeepLab to detect tubules from 87 WSIs of biopsies from native diabetic kidneys and transplant kidneys. We measure 206 features on each tubule, including commonly understood features like tubular basement membrane thickness and tubular diameter. Finally, we have developed a tool which allows a user to select a range of tubule morphometric features to be highlighted in corresponding WSIs. The tool can also highlight tubules in WSI leveraging multiple morphometric features through selection of regions-of-interest in a uniform manifold approximation and projection plot.",

In 72 cases the histopathologic lesions were identified, in 30 cases it was not possible to identify them and in 18 cases there was no sufficient kidney tissue. The diagnosis was very critical in at least 10 cases: there were 3 cases of primary oxalosis, one case of haemolytic uraemic syndrome, one case of necrotizing glomerulonephritis, one case of Wagner's granulomatosis, 3 cases of focal segmental glomerulosclerosis and one case of Fabry's disease. All but one of these were not diagnosed clinically. There was no patient mortality, and morbidity was significantly higher after open approach. We concluded that kidney biopsy in patients with chronic renal failure is mandatory especially if they are going to be transplanted and it is relatively safe especially when the percutaneous technique is employed.",

        "Published":null,
        "Abstract":"Diabetic nephropathy is the single most important cause of end-stage renal disease (ESRD) in the United States. Further, the increased risk of mortality from type I diabetes is almost entirely confined to patients developing clinical diabetic nephropathy. Nonetheless, kidney biopsy has had little role in the clinical assessment of diabetic patients or in the design of clinical research in diabetic nephropathy. The development of dipstick-positive proteinuria in patients with type I diabetes of more than 10 years' duration is regularly associated with advanced structural changes of diabetic nephropathology; in these patients, clinical parameters, especially the rate of decline of glomerular filtration rate (GFR), are accurate monitors of disease progression. Microalbuminuria indicates a very high risk of overt proteinuria and thus ESRD. This increased risk is associated with levels of urinary albumin excretion (UAE; greater than 30 micrograms\/min [45 mg\/24 h]), which are frequently accompanied by hypertension and reduced or decreasing GFR. At this stage, lesions of diabetic nephropathy are usually already well established. Thus, microalbuminuria is more a marker of early nephropathy than a predictor of later renal injury. Before these clinical stages of nephropathy, there are no accurate predictors of renal risk. Renal biopsy may serve this role by indicating those patients who are developing significant lesions during the \"silent\" phase of the disease. In large measure, this value of the biopsy derives from evidence that the lesions tend to develop linearly over time and can be measured by techniques that are relatively easily established in standard surgical pathology environments. Renal biopsies can serve to assure the majority of diabetic patients that they are developing serious lesions slowly, if at all.(ABSTRACT TRUNCATED AT 250 WORDS)",

We have therefore analyzed whether histological diagnosis of glomerulonephritis (GN) at an early stage of chronic kidney disease (CKD) is associated with different outcome compared to diagnosis at a more advanced stage.\nMETHODS: A cohort of 424 consecutive patients with histological diagnosis of GN were included in a retrospective data analysis. Kidney function was assessed by glomerular filtration rate (GFR) estimation at the time point of kidney biopsy and after consecutive immunosuppressive therapy. Censored events were death, initiation of dialysis or kidney transplantation, or progression of disease, defined as deterioration of CKD stage ≥ 1 from kidney biopsy to last available kidney function measurement.\nRESULTS: Occurrence of death, dialysis\/transplantation or progression of disease were associated with GFR and CKD stage at the time of kidney biopsy (p < 0.001 for all). Patients with CKD stage 1 and 2 at kidney biopsy had fewer endpoints compared to patients with a GFR of <60 ml\/min (p < 0.001).\nCONCLUSION: Kidney function at the time point of histological GN diagnosis is associated with clinical outcome, likely due to early initiation of specific drug treatment. This suggests that selection of therapy yields greatest benefit before renal function is impaired in GN.",

        "Abstract":"Obtaining renal tissue is often critical in the diagnosis and management of patients with renal disease of unknown etiology. Bleeding diathesis, liver disease, and obesity are common contraindications for percutaneous renal biopsy. In high-risk patients, transjugular renal biopsy is believed to be a safe and effective procedure. This study reports the experience of an academic interventional nephrology program with performing transjugular renal biopsy. We performed a retrospective observational study of 23 patients with either acute or chronic kidney disease with contraindications for percutaneous renal biopsy. All transjugular renal biopsies were performed by interventional nephrologists at our university. We studied the efficacy and safety of transjugular renal biopsy in these patients. Twenty out of 23 (87%) of the procedures yielded adequate tissue for pathologic diagnosis. Three (13%) patients required blood transfusions, none required coil embolization or nephrectomy, and there were no deaths. Even though performing transjugular renal biopsy requires considerable technical expertise and must be performed in an interventional radiology suite, it can be safely and effectively performed by well-trained interventional nephrologists to achieve pathological diagnosis.",

A renal biopsy can be a useful tool but may be complicated in LT recipients. We aimed to determine the clinical scenarios that prompted a decision to perform a renal biopsy in this patient population, to assess histological findings and evaluate patient management and survival and renal outcome.\nMETHODS: Information on clinical variables and renal histology was extracted from single-centre prospectively compiled databases from 1996 onwards.\nRESULTS: Over 2100 adults received an LT in the time period studied, and 54 of these (35 males and 19 females) were referred for renal review. Of these, 43% underwent a renal biopsy. They had a higher creatinine (P = 0.02), a greater deterioration in creatinine over the year prior to review and were more likely to be nephrotic (both P < 0.01). Histological findings included hypertensive changes (44%), CNI nephrotoxicity (48%), IgA nephropathy (9%), membranoproliferative glomerulonephritis (17%), acute tubular necrosis (4%), crescentic glomerulonephritis (4%) and diabetic nephropathy (9%). Major bleeding complications occurred in 17%. Treatment changed in the majority but, it was not significantly different in the two groups. Although initial renal function was worse in the biopsied group, final patient and renal survival did not differ between the two groups.\nCONCLUSION: A renal biopsy is a valuable tool in those with renal insufficiency and\/or proteinuria and haematuria but the benefits must be weighed against the relatively high complication rate in LT recipients.",

This study investigated an age-related and disease-related symptom, restless sleep, among older African American and white members of two sociodemographically matched cohorts, community-dwelling older adults and older adults with chronic renal failure undergoing maintenance dialysis therapy. Sleep behaviors reflect age-dependent and disease-dependent homeostatic and circadian state regulation but are also socioculturally patterned. As hypothesized, restless sleep was significantly more characteristic of the older adults in the chronic disease cohort. With non-renal health conditions, depressed mood, perceived health, medication use, and sociodemographic variables controlled, however, African Americans were significantly less likely than whites in the chronic disease cohort to report restless sleep. African American and white patients differed in their expression of public and private religiousness, which in turn were associated, respectively, with depressed mood and restless sleep complaint. In addition, we suggest that differences for African American and white patients in the environmental exposure of chronic dialysis therapy, including African Americans' greater social integration within the dialysis treatment setting, contributed to their being less at risk than their white peers for subjective perception of sleep decay, a marker of overall well-being.",

        "Abstract":"INTRODUCTION: Calciphylaxis, a rare obliterative small vessel vasculopathy associated with diabetes mellitus (DM), end-stage renal disease (ESRD), portends a poor prognosis. Because penile involvement is rare, agreement on appropriate diagnosis and management is unclear.\nAIM: To determine the role and effect of penile biopsy for diagnosis and management of penile calciphylaxis.\nMETHODS: Medical records of three penile calciphylaxis patients from our institution were evaluated. Data collected included age, history of DM, ESRD, and hemodialysis (HD) status, serum calcium (Ca), Ca × phosphorous product (C × P), parathyroid hormone (PTH), performance of biopsy, presence of non-penile cutaneous lesions, intervention, survival, and time from diagnosis to death. PubMed Search for relevant publications from 1995 to 2012 was performed to identify case reports of penile calciphylaxis that provided the same clinical data obtained from the 3 patients from our institution.\nMAIN OUTCOME MEASURES: Clinical evidence for outcomes in patients with penile calciphylaxis after biopsy of penile lesion compared to those without biopsy.\nRESULTS: A total of sixteen patients were identified in the literature and in our institution with clinical data of interest. Overall, 10\/16 (62.5%) patients identified with penile calciphylaxis had a penile biopsy, and 7\/10 (70%) experienced disease progression, while only 3\/10 (30%) stabilized. Mean time to death in this patient population was short, approximately 6.5 months, regardless of type of intervention.\nCONCLUSION: Based on the results of our study, we argue that conservative measures should be employed as first line therapy for penile calciphylaxis. More importantly, secondary to likely resultant progression of necrosis, penile biopsy is not only unnecessary for diagnosis of penile calciphylaxis, but is also harmful and contraindicated.",

        "Abstract":"['ah', 'ah', 'ah', 'ah', 'ah']\nCalcineurin inhibitor immunosuppressive drugs induce changes such as arteriolar hyalinosis (ah) in kidney transplants, raising the possibility that molecular changes in biopsies related to histologic ah can provide information about drug exposure. We hypothesized that molecular changes associated with less-than-expected hyalinosis might highlight a subpopulation of patients with under-immunosuppression\/nonadherence at intermediate times of biopsy posttransplant (TxBx). Using gene expression data from 562 indication biopsies, we developed a molecular classifier for predicting the expected ah lesions (M ) at a particular TxBx. M -scores increased linearly with log(TxBx), but some biopsies had lower scores than expected for TxBx. The deviation of individual M -scores below the predicted regression line of M -scores vs TxBx is defined as \"low hyalinosis index.\" Low hyalinosis indices were frequent in biopsies between 3 months and 3 years posttransplant, particularly among biopsies lacking histologic hyalinosis (ah0), and were associated with T cell-mediated rejection and a subset of recent-onset antibody-mediated rejection without glomerular double contours. In patients with medical records available for review, low hyalinosis indices were frequently associated with physician-recorded concerns about nonadherence (suspected or proven). We conclude that the M classifier and hyalinosis index identify indication biopsies with rejection for which the possibility of patient nonadherence should be considered.",

        "Abstract":"OBJECTIVES: Our aim was to evaluate which histologic lesions in a donor kidney were associated with graft function up to 5 years and with its dynamics.\nMATERIALS AND METHODS: We retrospectively investigated the association between acute and chronic individual histologic lesions and composite scores in preimplant and postreperfusion biopsies from deceased-donor (n = 101) and living-donor (n = 29) kidneys with initial graft function and function at discharge, at 6 months, and at 5 years and slopes of estimated glomerular filtration rate from discharge to 6 months and from 6 months to 5 years.\nRESULTS: A high frequency of chronic and acute histologic lesions in donor kidneys is characteristic of our population of donors with high cardiovascular risk. Glomerulitis in preimplant biopsies predicted delayed graft function. Arteriolar hyalinosis predicted impaired initial graft function. Arteriolar hyalinosis and arteriosclerosis both predicted lower estimated glomerular filtration rate at discharge and ≥ 25% drop in function after 6 months. Glomerulosclerosis affected the estimated glomerular filtration rate at discharge and at 6 months; percentage of changed glomeruli predicted lower function at discharge and at 5 years. Glomerular thrombi in preimplant and postreperfusion biopsies predicted negative slope in estimated glomerular filtration rate from discharge to 6 months and a ≥ 25% drop in function after 6 months, respectively. Fibrinoid necrosis in glomeruli in preimplant biopsies predicted decline in function of ≥ 5 mL\/min\/1.73m² every year after 6 months. Chronic and total preimplant and posttransplant Banff scores predicted lower estimated glomerular filtration rate at discharge and at 6 months, with ≥ 25% drop in function after 6 months.\nCONCLUSIONS: Intraoperative biopsies are important in identifying patients at risk for worse graft function, especially concerning absence of gain of function early after transplant and loss of function late after transplant.",

        "Abstract":"Between November 1985 and November 1989, percutaneous renal biopsy was performed in 32 patients aged 75 or more (mean age 78). The major clinical presentations were nephrotic syndrome in 22 patients, variable amounts of proteinuria in 6 patients and unexplained severe renal insufficiency in 4 patients. In 27 cases the histological study revealed a glomerular disease. Minimal change disease (7 cases), membranous nephropathy (6 cases), amyloidosis (5 cases) and crescentic glomerulonephritis were the most frequent types. The rate of complications after biopsy was low (3 percent) with only one retroperitoneal hematoma. Owing to the atypical renal presentation of some glomerulopathies in the elderly, renal biopsy was useful to differentiate between minimal change disease, membranous nephropathy and amyloidosis. In 4 patients with minimal change disease, remission of nephrotic syndrome was obtained with corticosteroids. Moreover renal biopsy allowed to detect underlying diseases and gave indications to initiate specific therapy particularly in crescentic glomerulonephritis the outcome of which remained unfavourable. It is concluded that, even in elderly, renal biopsy is a valuable and safe diagnostic tool to obtain a rapid diagnosis, particularly in glomerular diseases, leading to a biopsy-guided therapy. It must therefore have the same indications as in younger adults with glomerular syndrome or rapidly progressive renal insufficiency.",

        "Abstract":"PURPOSE: Male infertility is a serious problem in patients on hemodialysis. Our understanding is that end stage renal disease or hemodialysis causes poor semen quality but the mechanism leading to impaired spermatogenesis is largely unknown.\nMATERIALS AND METHODS: Testicular volume in 120 patients on maintenance hemodialysis was compared with that in age matched healthy controls. Volume was correlated with clinical findings. In 10 testicular biopsy specimens from patients on hemodialysis who visited our infertility clinic Western blotting was performed to examine the generation of 4-HNE modified proteins, which are markers of oxidative stress, and the expression of proliferating cell nuclear antigen. Interstitial fibrosis was determined by Masson's trichrome staining.\nRESULTS: Mean bilateral testicular volume in patients on hemodialysis was significantly smaller than that in healthy controls (31.7 vs 36.4 ml, p <0.01) in a hemodialysis duration dependent manner (r = -0.32, p <0.01). The increase in serum ferritin correlated inversely with testicular volume (r = -0.25, p <0.01). The generation of 4-HNE modified proteins was significantly increased 3.1-fold in patients on hemodialysis, following the 60% decreased expression of proliferating cell nuclear antigen. Quantitative analysis of Masson's trichrome staining revealed increased interstitial fibrosis in patients on hemodialysis compared with that in controls (41.5% vs 14.8%, p <0.01). Serum ferritin, proliferating cell nuclear antigen expression and interstitial fibrosis correlated with the generation of 4-HNE modified proteins (p <0.05).\nCONCLUSIONS: Testicular volume, which is a parameter of spermatogenesis, is impaired in patients on hemodialysis and oxidative stress is considered to be involved in the process. Serum ferritin is a useful parameter for predicting oxidative stress in the testis.",

Group I consisted of 8 non-dialysed patients without any clinical or biochemical sign of liver disturbance nor any iron supplementation. Group II consisted of 25 maintenance hemodialysis (MHD) patients treated from 2 to 13 years. 19 subjects had chronic B hepatitis. Total exogenous iron load parenteral iron and\/or blood transfusions) was calculated. Body iron overload (hemosiderosis) was assessed by liver iron concentration (LIC) in needle biopsy specimens according to Barry's method (less than 200 microgram\/100 mg dry weight) and serum ferritin levels (less than 360 ng\/ml). 4 patients whose serum ferritin was increased with or without hepatic fibrosis and with or without any organ dysfunction due to hemochromatosis received i.v. infusions of desferrioxamine in doses of 2 g at each dialysis. Serum ferritin levels were correlated with LIC (p less than 0.001) and iron load (p less than 0.001). Hemosiderosis was noted in 16 MHD patients (group II) and correlated with iron load. Hemochromatosis was noted in 4 patients (group II). 4 hemodialysed patients with iron overload were treated by desferrioxamine from 6 to 18 months. During this therapy, body iron stores fell and organ dysfunction (heart failure, hepatic cytolysis, anaemia, diabetes mellitus improved. Long-term chelation therapy by desferrioxamine was effective and the chelated iron was readily removed by dialysis. These data show the importance of precise evaluation of iron stores in MHD patients.",

        "Abstract":"Plasmacytomas are rare immunoproliferative monoclonal plasma cell diseases of lymphoid lineage that may present in an isolated or systemic manner. Systemic involvement is much more common than occurrences isolated to a particular organ, and for this reason, it is imperative to rule out systemic involvement for osseous and nonosseous isolated neoplasms. These neoplasms present unique challenges due to their location, extent of involvement, vague presentation, and dearth of treatment protocol. We report the case of a 69-year-old man who developed chronic kidney disease stage 4 between 2009 and 2012. Precipitous kidney failure, anorexia, fatigue, and flank pain necessitated clinical follow-up that ultimately led to thorough imaging and bilateral kidney biopsy. Protein electrophoresis, immunohistochemistry, and immunofluorescence were all consistent with bilateral renal extramedullary plasmacytomas. Treatment recommendations are often limited to prior case successes; however, chemotherapy, radiation, and surgery are the mainstay of treatment. Although surgery or combined therapy provides the best results for patients, such options are unfeasible with bilateral kidney involvement. Therefore, a chemotherapy regimen, similar to that for multiple myeloma, was determined to be most reasonable. Treatment consisted of 4 cycles of a bortezomib, cyclophosphamide, and dexamethasone regimen. Three months following chemotherapy, kidney function returned to baseline levels.",

        "Abstract":"INTRODUCTION: Clinical indicators or pathological features alone cannot reliably predict renal survival in patients with biopsy-confirmed diabetic nephropathy (DN). Therefore, this analysis sought to develop and validate a predictive model incorporating both clinical and pathological markers to predict renal outcomes in patients with biopsy-confirmed DN.\nMETHODS: A predictive nomogram was developed based upon data pertaining to 194 patients with biopsy-confirmed DN. The prognostic relevance of individual clinicopathological variables was assessed through univariate and multivariate Cox regression analyses. A prognostic nomogram was then developed and validated based upon concordance (C)-index values and calibration curves. Internal validation was conducted through bootstrap resampling, while the clinical utility of this model was assessed via a decision curve analysis (DCA) approach.\nRESULTS: Nephrotic-range 24-h proteinuria, late-stage CKD, glomerular classification III-IV, and IFTA score 2-3 were all identified as independent predictors of poor renal outcomes in DN patients and were incorporated into our final nomogram. Calibration curves revealed good agreement between predicted and actual 3- and 5-year renal survival in DN patients with the C-index value for this nomogram at 0.845 (95% CI: 0.826-0.864). DCA revealed that our nomogram was superior to models based solely upon clinical indicators.\nCONCLUSION: A predictive nomogram incorporating clinical and pathological indicators was developed and validated for the prediction of renal survival outcomes in patients with biopsy-confirmed DN. This model will be of value to clinicians, as it can serve as an easy-to-use and reliable tool for physicians to guide patient management based on individualized risk.",

        "Abstract":"BACKGROUND: The renal resistive index (RI) is a Doppler-derived measure that reportedly correlates with renal histological changes and renal disease severity and outcome. The aim of this study was to investigate the factors related to the RI elevation in chronic kidney disease (CKD).\nMETHODS: Using Doppler ultrasonography, RIs were determined in 30 patients with CKD, after which they were correlated with interstitial fibrosis, arteriosclerosis, arteriolosclerosis and peritubular capillary (PTC) density. PTC-positive areas were determined based on CD34 immunostaining. Interstitial fibrosis was detected with Masson trichrome staining. All histological markers were assessed using quantitative and semi-quantitative analyses and evaluated statistically using Pearson correlation tests, unpaired t tests and stepwise multiple regression analysis.\nRESULTS: RI correlated positively with age (r = 0.603, p = 0.0004), systolic blood pressure (r = 0.775, p < 0.0001), diastolic blood pressure (r = 0.575, p = 0.001), interstitial fibrosis (r = 0.381, p = 0.038) and arteriosclerosis (r = 0.520, p = 0.003), and negatively with creatinine clearance (r = -0.471, p = 0.009) and CD34+ (PTC) areas (r = -0.437, p = 0.016). Patients with hypertension or diabetes mellitus showed higher RIs (p < 0.05) than those without the ailments. Multivariate analysis showed PTC and arteriosclerosis to be independent variables correlating with RI (r (2) = 0.321, p < 0.05).\nCONCLUSIONS: To our knowledge, this is the first report of using RI measurements to evaluate peritubular capillary loss.

Renal biopsy is a valuable tool to provide histological evidence. However, the safety in patients with type 2 diabetes receiving renal biopsy is not well evaluated. This study was conducted to monitor the dynamic complications and to evaluate the safety of biopsy in diabetic patients.\nMETHODS: A prospective observation was performed on 130 patients with type 2 diabetes and 150 patients not undergoing renal biopsy. The complications were monitored at 4 h, 8 h, 24 h, 48 h and 72 h sequentially after biopsy.\nRESULTS: Haematoma was observed in 34 (26.15%) patients with diabetes and 50 (33.33%) in controls (P=0.19). The timing of large haematoma peaked at 4 h. Gross haematuria occurred in 12 (9.23%) diabetic patients and eight (5.33%) controls (P=0.207). It happened mainly within 8 h. Renal pathological diagnosis showed 96 (73.85%) cases with diabetic nephropathy and 34 (26.15%) cases with non-diabetic renal disease.\nCONCLUSION: Renal biopsy in patients with type 2 diabetes is safe. The frequency of complications after renal biopsy in diabetes is no higher than those without diabetes. The complications mostly happened within 8 h, especially within 4 h.

Aim of our investigation was to evaluate the clinico-pathological correlation of myofibroblasts expression as markers for initial development of fibrotic processes and macrophagic infiltration in a population with impaired renal function, in order to better understand their value in diagnostic biopsies.\nMATERIALS, METHODS AND RESULTS: We evaluated 20 consecutive native kidney biopsies performed for diagnostic purposes. Material remaining after routine light microscopy and immunofluorescence, was stained for α-SMA as myofibroblast marker and CD68 as macrophage infiltration marker. Quantitative evaluation was conducted by electronic image analysis on consecutive low power fields, avoiding glomeruli, and estimated as percentage of the total area or as number of positive cells\/field for macrophage infiltration. The renal biopsies were also evaluated for histological characteristics such as percentual area of inflammation infiltration and fibrosis. Clinical and laboratory data were recorded at biopsy moment and followed-up on a period of 17 ± 11 months after the renal biopsy. Interstitial α-SMA immunoexpression proved to be related with interstitial fibrosis (r=-0.47, p<0.001) and macrophage infiltration (r=0.21, p=0.03). Higher immunoexpression of α-SMA was related with renal function assessed by creatinine level at biopsy moment (r=0.32, p=0.002).\nCONCLUSIONS: In this study, detection of myofibroblast infiltration using α-smooth-muscle actin (α-SMA) proved to be a good marker in describing the initial phases of interstitial fibrosis development in early stages of chronic kidney dysfunction.",

We hypothesized that such findings were due to defective muscle protein synthesis. We measured synthetic rates of mixed muscle proteins, myosin heavy chain, and mitochondrial proteins in serial muscle biopsy samples during a continuous infusion of L[1-(13)C]leucine from 12 patients with chronic renal failure and 10 healthy control subjects under identical study conditions. Patients with chronic renal failure have significantly lower synthetic rates of mixed muscle proteins and myosin heavy chain (27 and 37% reductions, respectively, P < 0.05 and P < 0.02). Significant declines in the synthetic rates of muscle mitochondrial protein (27%) (P < 0.05), muscle cytochrome c-oxidase activity (42%) (P < 0.007), and citrate synthase (27%) (P < 0.007) were also observed in patients with chronic renal failure. The synthetic rates of muscle proteins and activity of mitochondrial enzymes were negatively correlated to the severity of renal failure. These results indicate that in chronic renal failure there is a decrease in the synthesis of muscle contractile and mitochondrial proteins and a decrease in muscle mitochondrial oxidative enzymes. Reduced synthetic rate of several muscle proteins is the likely biochemical basis of muscle loss and muscle weakness in people with chronic renal failure.",

He underwent kidney biopsy before and 2 years after treatment and repeat non-contrast-enhanced MRI of the kidney every 6 months. An age- and sex-matched healthy volunteer was included as a normal control. The patient showed a striking positive immunologic response to therapy. Repeat MRI of the kidney documented progressive kidney functional recovery, with a significant widespread increase in kidney diffusivity, assessed using diffusion-weighted imaging, paralleling the increase in glomerular filtration rate and regression of albuminuria. Renal blood flow and ultrafiltration coefficient, assessed using phase-contrast MRI, significantly increased, suggesting an increase in filtration fraction.

Laparoscopic renal biopsy has recently been reported as an alternative to open renal biopsy.\nMETHODS: Thirty-two patients who had proteinuria and\/or renal insufficiency underwent laparoscopic renal biopsy at our center. The indications for biopsy included failed percutaneous biopsy (N = 3), morbid obesity (14), solitary kidney (5), chronic anticoagulation\/coagulopathy (6), religious consideration (refusal of potential blood transfusion) (2), multiple bilateral renal cysts and body habitus (1 case each). The kidney was approached via a laparoscopic retroperitoneal route (retroperitoneoscopy) using a two port technique. The lower pole of the kidney was localized using blunt dissection, laparoscopic cup biopsies were performed, and hemostasis was achieved using standard techniques.\nRESULTS: All biopsies were successfully completed laparoscopically with sufficient tissue obtained for histopathological diagnosis in all cases. Mean estimated blood loss was 25.9 ml (range 5 to 100). None of the patients required parenteral narcotics during the perioperative period. Operative time ranged from 0.8 to 3.0 hours (mean 1.5). Mean hospital stay was 1.7 days (range 0 to 7). Sixteen patients were treated as outpatients. Patients returned to normal activity at a mean of 1.7 weeks (range 0.3 to 3.0) postoperatively. In one patient, the spleen was inadvertently biopsied without consequence. An additional patient developed a postoperative 300 cc perinephric hematoma that resolved without the need for intervention. One postoperative mortality occurred on postoperative day seven secondary to a perforated peptic ulcer in a patient undergoing high-dose steroid therapy for lupus nephritis.\nCONCLUSION: Laparoscopic renal biopsy is a safe, reliable, minimally invasive alternative to open renal biopsy for patients in whom a closed percutaneous approach is either a relative or absolute contraindication, which can be performed on an outpatient basis.",

The actuarial renal survival rate for all patients was 92% at 1 year and 76% at 3 years, for Wegener's granulomatosis 80% at 1 and 3 years, for microscopic polyangiitis 85% at 1 and 3 years, and for renal limited disease (GN) 75% at 1 and 37% at 3 years. Age (P = 0.024), arterial hypertension (P = 0.018), proteinuria (P = 0.037) and serum cre-atinine > or =400 micro mol\/l (P = 0.047) were the most important risk factors for ESRD.\nCONCLUSION: The actuarial renal survival rate in elderly patients with ANCA-associated GN was 92% at 1 year and 76% at 3 years. Older age, arterial hypertension, proteinuria and serum creatinine > or =400 micro mol\/l related to ESRD.",

        "Abstract":"Renal amyloidosis is a rare complication of adult onset Still's disease. We here report three cases of renal amyloidosis in a series of 33 cases of adult onset Still's disease. The three patients enrolled had an average age of 43 years (with a range from 33 to 58 years). The diagnosis of Still's disease was retained on the basis of febrile polyarthritis (3 cases) associated with fleeting rush (1 case), biologic inflammatory syndrome in the absence of any infectious, inflammatory or neoplastic causes. All patients were treated with corticosteroids secondarily associated with methotrexate due to destructive polyarthritis (2 cases) and to a recurrence (1 case). Renal amyloidosis had occurred 4.9 years after Still's disease (with a range from 33 months to 7 years). Amyloidosis was revealed by nephrotic syndrome (3 cases) associated with renal failure (1 case). Diagnosis was based on renal puncture biopsy (3 cases) which showed AA amyloidosis (2 cases) and untyped amyloidosis (1 case). All patients received colchicine. Outcome was favorable in a female patient while in the other two patients the disease progressed to chronic renal failure. Renal amyloidosis uncommonly results from adult onset Still's disease.

        "Abstract":"BACKGROUND: Renal damage is a progressive complication of sickle cell disease (SCD). Microalbuminuria is common in children with SCD, while a smaller number of children have more severe renal manifestations necessitating kidney biopsy. There is limited information on renal biopsy findings in children with SCD and subsequent management and outcome.\nMETHODS: This is a multicenter retrospective analysis of renal biopsy findings and clinical outcomes in children and adolescents with SCD. We included children and adolescents (age ≤ 20 years) with SCD who had a kidney biopsy performed at a pediatric nephrology unit. The clinical indication for biopsy, biopsy findings, subsequent treatments, and outcomes were analyzed.\nRESULTS: Thirty-six SCD patients (ages 4-19 years) were identified from 14 centers with a median follow-up of 2.6 years (0.4-10.4 years). The indications for biopsy were proteinuria (92%) and elevated creatinine (30%). All biopsies had abnormal findings, including mesangial hypercellularity (75%), focal segmental glomerulosclerosis (30%), membranoproliferative glomerulonephritis (16%), and thrombotic microangiopathy (2%). There was increased use of hydroxyurea, angiotensin-converting-enzyme inhibitors, and angiotensin receptor blockers following renal biopsy. At last follow-up, 3 patients were deceased, 2 developed insulin-dependent diabetes mellitus, 6 initiated chronic hemodialysis, 1 received a bone marrow transplant, and 1 received a kidney transplant.\nCONCLUSIONS: Renal biopsies, while not commonly performed in children with SCD, were universally abnormal. Outcomes were poor in this cohort of patients despite a variety of post-biopsy interventions. Effective early intervention to prevent chronic kidney disease (CKD) is needed to reduce morbidity and mortality in children with SCD.",

        "Abstract":"Objective To evaluate long-term mortality and end-stage renal disease (ESRD) in a cohort of Norwegian patients with biopsy-proven lupus nephritis (LN). Methods Renal biopsies were obtained from 178 patients with LN from 1988 until 2007. Mortality rate and death causes were provided by Statistics Norway and ESRD data were provided by the Norwegian Renal Registry. Risk factors for all-cause mortality were evaluated by Cox regression. Standardized mortality ratio (SMR) was compared to observed deaths in a matched general population sample. Results Mean age was 37.6 (±14.4) years, and median time of follow-up was 8.5 years (0-26.2). Thirty-six patients (20.2%) died during follow-up. The SMR for all-cause mortality was 5.6 (Confidence interval [CI] 3.7-7.5). In an adjusted multivariate analysis proliferative glomerulonephritis (LN class IV) was independently associated with all-cause mortality; hazard ratio (HR) 2.6 (Confidence interval [CI] 1.2-5.7 p = 0.017). Main causes of death were infections (47.2%) and cardiovascular events 8 (22.2%). Thirty-six patients (20.2%) reached ESRD. Conclusions Biopsy-proven LN is associated with increased mortality compared to the general population. LN class IV is associated with all-cause mortality. Infections and cardiovascular events were the most common causes of death. Patients with LN have a high incidence of ESRD.",

Here we report the case of a 78-year-old white male with a past medical history of diabetes mellitus, hypertension, and chronic kidney disease stage III with a baseline serum creatinine of 2.5 mg\/dl. The patient had a prior admission history for acute kidney injury (AKI) attributed to dehydration and medication-induced nephro-toxicities. He presented to the renal clinic for follow-up with acute worsening of chronic kidney failure with a serum creatinine level of 3.5 mg\/dl. Examination revealed that he was anemic and mildly hypercalcemic with suppressed parathyroid hormone and had proteinuria of 1.3 g per day. The computed tomography scan of the abdomen revealed right renal pelvic non-obstructing calculi. Serum protein electrophoresis revealed gammopathy with two distinct monoclonal peaks consisting of immunoglobulin G (IgG) kappa and IgG lambda, respectively. The kappa\/lambda ratio was within normal limits, and urine protein electrophoresis showed no evidence of a monoclonal peak or Bence Jones proteins. Further workup for multiple myeloma, including bone marrow (BM) biopsy, revealed polyclonal plasma cells and B cells with no clonality. No morphological and immune-phenotypic evidence of plasma cell dyscrasia was found, but BM biopsy did show numerous non-caseating granulomas consistent with sarcoidosis. Skin biopsy from non-scaly 6-mm skin colored papule also showed non-caseating granulomas.

The Brazilian Registry of Bone Biopsy (REBRABO) is an electronic database that includes renal osteodystrophy (RO) data. We aimed to describe the epidemiological profile of RO in a sample of CKD-MBD Brazilian patients and understand its relationship with outcomes.\nMETHODS: Between August 2015 and March 2018, 260 CKD-MBD stage 3-5D patients who underwent bone biopsy were followed for 12 to 30 months. Clinical-demographic, laboratory, and histological data were analyzed. Bone fractures, hospitalizations, and death were considered the primary outcomes.\nRESULTS: Osteitis fibrosa, mixed uremic osteodystrophy, adynamic bone disease, osteomalacia, osteoporosis, and aluminum (Al) accumulation were detected in 85, 43, 27, 10, 77, and 65 patients, respectively. The logistic regression showed that dialysis vintage was an independent predictor of osteoporosis (OR: 1.005; CI: 1.001-1.010; p = 0.01). The multivariate logistic regression revealed that hemodialysis treatment (OR: 11.24; CI: 1.227-100; p = 0.03), previous parathyroidectomy (OR: 4.97; CI: 1.422-17.241; p = 0.01), and female gender (OR: 2.88; CI: 1.080-7.679; p = 0.03) were independent predictors of Al accumulation; 115 patients were followed for 21 ± 5 months. There were 56 hospitalizations, 14 deaths, and 7 fractures during follow-up. The COX regression revealed that none of the variable related to the RO\/turnover, mineralization and volume (TMV) classification was an independent predictor of the outcomes.\nCONCLUSION: Hospitalization or death was not influenced by the type of RO, Al accumulation, or TMV classification. An elevated prevalence of osteoporosis and Al accumulation was detected.",

However, little is known about the prevalence of Fabry nephropathy (FN) in patients with chronic kidney disease (CKD). We extracted FN data from the Japan Renal Biopsy Registry, analyzed the prevalence of FN, and examined the correlation between clinical characteristics and renal involvement according to sex differences and hemi- and heterozygosity in patients with FD.\nMETHODS: A total of 38,351 participants who underwent renal biopsy were retrospectively enrolled, and FN was determined. The clinical characteristics of FD patients were examined based on sex differences.\nRESULTS: Twenty-nine patients (0.076%) (19 males and 10 females, mean age: 43.7 ± 15.5 years old) were diagnosed with FN. Median estimated urinary protein (UP) and mean eGFR levels were 0.9 [interquartile range (IQR) [0.7-1.6] g\/gCr and 67.1 ± 36.8 mL\/min\/1.73 m, respectively. Mean systolic blood pressure (SBP) was 126.4 ± 17.1 mmHg and diastolic blood pressure was 76.1 ± 12.6 mmHg. An inverse correlation between eGFR and logarithm UP levels was observed (r = 0.23, p = 0.02), SBP was positively associated with logarithm UP (r = 0.34, p = 0.004) overall and inversely associated with eGFR (r = 0.25, p = 0.007) regardless of sex, and SBP was an independent determinant of proteinuria (p = 0.004) and eGFR (p = 0.007).\nCONCLUSIONS: The prevalence of biopsy-proven FN was 0.076%. Since SBP is associated with eGFR regardless of zygosity, strict SBP control might be necessary to prevent progression to end-stage kidney disease in both male and female patients with FN.",

        "Abstract":"BACKGROUND: Percutaneous renal biopsy (PRB) is essential for the diagnosis, prognosis, and management of children with unknown kidney disease. In this study, the safety and efficacy of PRB is investigated, and also the common etiologies of childhood kidney disease, based on histological findings. In addition, we explored the role of PRBs in the diagnosis of children who presented with persistent asymptomatic hematuria.\nMETHODS: By chart review, from July 2005 to July 2009, a total of 99 PRBs were performed on 91 children (43 girls and 48 boys; mean age, 10.9 ± 4.4 years) under ultrasound (US) guidance, by a doctor, using an automated 18-gauge biopsy needle following the same protocol, at a medical center in northern Taiwan.\nRESULTS: The accuracy of the histological diagnosis was excellent. The most common post-biopsy complications were perirenal hematoma (11.1%) and asymptomatic gross hematuria (3.0%), respectively. Nevertheless, these complications resolved spontaneously, and none had major bleeding episodes. Histological results showed that lupus nephritis, minimal change disease, and IgA nephropathy (IgAN) could be the current leading causes of childhood kidney diseases in Taiwan.\nCONCLUSIONS: Automated ultrasound (US)-guided PRB is a safe and reliable method of assessing childhood renal disease. A recent study shows that the presence of persistent asymptomatic isolated microhematuria in adolescents is a predictive marker of future end-stage renal disease. Hence, the emphasis of renal biopsy on children with persistent asymptomatic hematuria is beneficial for the early diagnosis of IgAN or other glomerulonephritis (GN), which tends toward progressive kidney disease in adulthood without prompt therapeutic intervention.",

The aim of this study was to determine the clinical, demographic, and genetic characteristics and type of glomerular lesions in pediatric FMF patients who underwent kidney biopsy.\nMETHODS: The data of 30 pediatric FMF patients with biopsy-proven glomerulopathy were retrospectively reviewed. Patients were grouped into 2 categories as amyloid nephropathy (AN, n = 16) and non-amyloid nephropathy (N-AN, n = 14).\nRESULTS: The mean age at FMF diagnosis was 7.2 ± 3.0 years. The AN group showed higher rates of hypertension, higher levels of 24-h protein excretion and serum creatinine, and lower estimated glomerular filtration rate at the time of kidney biopsy. The rate of ESRD was found to be higher in the AN group (p = 0.011). Mesangioproliferative glomerulonephritis was the most common pathology in the N-AN group (21.4%). The frequency of amyloidosis was significantly higher in patients with homozygous p.M694V mutations than non-homozygous p.M694V mutations (p = 0.039).\nCONCLUSIONS: In children with FMF, nephropathy is rare. To our knowledge, this is the first study performed in pediatric FMF patients exploring amyloid and non-amyloid glomerulopathies. Patients with AN had higher rates of proteinuria, lower estimated glomerular filtration rate levels, and higher blood pressure than N-AN patients at the time of biopsy.",

Significant complications occurred in only four patients. In 170 patients (83%) the biopsy yielded information of diagnostic and prognostic value and influenced management. The main indications for biopsy were nephrotic syndrome, in 63 patients, and chronic renal failure, in 58 patients. The most frequent findings were minimal change disease, focal segmental glomerulosclerosis, IgA nephropathy, membranous glomerulonephritis and mesangiocapillary glomerulonephritis. The most obvious association between indication and histology was between haematuria and IgA nephropathy.

A noninvasive test that sensitively detects these injuries would benefit the patients.\nMETHODS: Urine samples were collected from healthy controls and kidney transplant recipients. Urine samples were screened first with an antibody array consisting of 120 chemokines and cytokines and then with a multiplex beads assay. Representative parameters, including macrophage inflammatory protein-1Delta, osteoprotegerin, monokine induced by interferon-gamma (IFN), and IFN-gamma-induced protein of 10 kDa, were simultaneously determined by a quadruplex assay in urine samples from 84 patients with renal allograft injury, 29 patients with stable graft function, and 19 healthy individuals.\nRESULTS: Twenty-three cytokines\/chemokines were found to be elevated in urine samples of patients with acute rejection by the antibody array. The second round of screening confirmed that 11 of the 23 parameters were elevated in the patients but not in the healthy controls. Induced protein of 10 kDa and monokine induced by IFN-gamma were significantly elevated in urine samples of patients with acute renal injury, and macrophage inflammatory protein-1Delta and osteoprotegerin were significantly elevated in patients with both acute and chronic renal injuries. The combination of the four parameters had a high positive detection rate (97.6%) for renal transplant injury and could differentiate between acute and chronic injury.\nCONCLUSION: These results might indicate that the present multiplex assay provides a basis to establish a noninvasive method for the diagnosis and monitoring of renal transplant injury.",

CD147\/basigin is involved in the pathogenesis of acute kidney injury and renal fibrosis through inflammatory cell infiltration. The present study examined the clinical relevance of CD147 in biopsy-proven kidney diseases that lead to the progression of chronic kidney disease.\nMETHODS: Kidney biopsy specimens and plasma and urine samples were obtained from patients with kidney diseases, including IgA nephropathy (IgAN), Henoch-Schönlein purpura nephritis (HSPN), diabetic kidney disease (DKD), focal segmental glomerulosclerosis (FSGS), and membranous nephropathy (MN), who underwent renal biopsy between 2011 and 2014. Plasma and urinary CD147 levels were measured and evaluated for their ability to reflect histological features. Disease activity of IgAN tissues was evaluated according to the Oxford classification and the Japanese histological grading system.\nRESULTS: In biopsy tissues, CD147 induction was detected in injured lesions representing renal inflammation. Plasma CD147 values correlated with eGFR in patients with inflammation-related kidney diseases such as IgAN, HSPN, and DKD. Particularly in IgAN patients, plasma CD147 levels were correlated with injured regions comprising more than 50% of glomeruli or with tubular atrophy\/interstitial injury in biopsy tissues. Proteinuria showed a closer correlation with urinary values of CD147 and L-FABP. Of note, plasma and urinary CD147 levels showed a strong correlation with eGFR or proteinuria, respectively, only in DKD patients.\nCONCLUSION: Evaluation of plasma and urinary CD147 levels might provide key insights for the understanding of the activity of various kidney diseases.",

The biopsy was systematically done for patients who were candidates for elective NP. The criteria for elective indications NP tumors were less than 4cm, low grade Fuhrman (I and II). The tubulopapillary tumors (TBP) on biopsy were excluded from the elective indications. The parameters studied were the biopsy data, overall survival, disease-free survival.\nRESULTS: The median age was 59 years (32-79 years) and 69% of tumor were fortuitous discovery. Indications of need accounted for 30% of cases (single kidney, bilateral tumors and chronic renal failure [CRF]). Biopsy allowed a diagnosis in 89% of cases. There was one death in specific postoperative immediately. A final histology was 75% of clear cell carcinoma, 13.3% of chromophobe and 11.7% of TBP, 96.6% of T1a including 86.6% of low grade and no surgical margin. The median follow-up was 49 months with 98.5% of specific survival at 5 years, one local recurrence and no general recurrence.\nCONCLUSION: The study has shown that the selection of patients by biopsy gives satisfactory carcinologic results with 98.5% specific survival at the end of follow-up; it is between 89 and 100% in the literature.",

The traditional term of ROD does not accurately include the wide spectrum of \"CKD-mineral and bone disorder\" (CKD-MBD) and has been restricted to define the several specific histologic disturbances of bone disease associated with CKD. Circulating parathyroid hormone (PTH) and total alkaline phosphatase levels do not always reflect bone turnover in CKD-MBD, whereas bone biopsy provides precise information regarding bone pathology. Given the lack of specificity of several biomarkers and noninvasive tools regarding ROD, bone biopsy is required for precise diagnosis and for the determination of therapeutic strategies. In clinical practice, bone biopsy is not performed due to lack of enthusiasm among nephrologists for several reasons including the invasiveness of the procedure, the potential pain, and lack of technical training. Since the application of bone biopsy in clinical practice is unrealistic, several biomarkers with specificity for bone disease should be studied.",

The purposes of this report are to review the clinical and laboratory features of 14 patients with pneumococcal HUS and present a modified classification to capture cases that may not have been documented with a diagnosis of pneumococcal HUS. We thereby provide a rationale for including patients with concurrent disseminated intravascular coagulopathy and\/or those whose culture results were negative, and we highlight the emergence of serotype 19A subsequent to the introduction of 7-valent pneumococcal protein conjugate vaccine (Prevnar). This is the largest series of such subjects (to our knowledge) from a single center. Sixty-four percent of the patients recovered without any long-term sequelae. Three patients developed chronic kidney disease, 1 developed end-stage renal failure, and 1 died in the acute phase. The greatest risk factor for the development of chronic kidney disease is the need for acute dialysis for >20 days, and death in the acute phase is rare unless meningitis is the primary infection.",

        "Abstract":"Histologic assessment of kidney transplant biopsies relies on cortex rather than medulla, but for microarray studies, the proportion cortex in a biopsy is typically unknown and could affect the molecular readings. The present study aimed to develop a molecular estimate of proportion cortex in biopsies and examine its effect on molecular diagnoses. Microarrays from 26 kidney transplant biopsies divided into cortex and medulla components and processed separately showed that many of the most significant differences were in glomerular genes (e.g. NPHS2, NPHS1, CLIC5, PTPRO, PLA2R1, PLCE1, PODXL, and REN). Using NPHS2 (podocin) to estimate proportion cortex, we examined whether proportion cortex influenced molecular assessment in the molecular microscope diagnostic system. In 1190 unselected kidney transplant indication biopsies (Clinicaltrials.govNCT01299168), only 11% had <50% cortex. Molecular scores for antibody-mediated rejection, T cell-mediated rejection, and injury were independent of proportion cortex. Rejection was diagnosed in many biopsies that were mostly or all medulla. Agreement in molecular diagnoses in paired cortex\/medulla samples (23\/26) was similar to biological replicates (32\/37). We conclude that NPHS2 expression can estimate proportion cortex; that proportion cortex has little influence on molecular diagnosis of rejection; and that, although histology cannot assess medulla, rejection does occur in medulla as well as cortex.",

Increasing evidence reported the role of the overactivated complement system in the pathogenesis of DKD. Whether renal complement depositions are associated with renal outcomes of DKD in T2DM is of interest.\nMETHODS: A total of 213 biopsy-proven DKD patients with T2DM were retrospectively recruited. Clinical and pathological data of the patients were analyzed. Kaplan-Meier analysis and Cox regression analysis were performed to explore predictors of end-stage renal disease (ESRD).\nRESULTS: During a median follow-up of 23.0 (12.0, 39.0) months, 100\/213 (46.9%) patients progressed to ESRD. C3c and C1q deposition were observed in 133\/213 (62.4%) and 45\/213 (21.1%) patients, respectively. Kaplan-Meier analysis revealed patients with C3c or C1q deposition had significantly worse renal outcomes compared with those without C3c or C1q deposition (p = .001 and p < .001, respectively). Univariate and multivariate Cox regression analysis demonstrated proteinuria (per 1 g\/24 h increase, hazard ratio [HR] 1.134, 95% confidence interval [CI] [1.079, 1.191], p < .001), interstitial fibrosis and tubular atrophy score (score 2 and 3 vs. 0 and 1, HR 3.925, 95% CI [1.855, 8.304], p < .001), and C3c deposition (per 1+ increase, HR 1.299, 95% CI [1.073, 1.573], p = .007) were independent predictors for ESRD in DKD patients with T2DM.\nCONCLUSIONS: C3c deposition in the kidney was associated with worse renal outcomes and was an independent predictor for ESRD in DKD patients with T2DM.",

The specimens were evaluated for histological features of APSN and other significant clinical parameters. The result of antiphospholipid antibodies, clinical course, and renal function from chart review were analysed.\nRESULTS: The prevalence of APSN in systemic lupus erythematosus patients who underwent renal biopsies was 34% (16% in <15-year-old group, 41.5% in > or =15-year-old group). APSN was associated with more severe hypertension (P = 0.002 for systolic and P = 0.004 for diastolic blood pressure), acute renal failure (P = 0.003), persistent heavy proteinuria (P < 0.001 for 4+ proteinuria), severe lupus nephritis (class III and IV, P = 0.014, high activity and chronicity indices, P < 0.001) and a tendency to progress to end-stage renal disease.\nCONCLUSION: Systemic lupus erythematosus patients who underwent renal biopsies in our institute showed a prevalence of APSN comparable to those in western countries. The presence of APSN was significantly higher in the adult than in the paediatric population. Its association with poor prognostic indicators suggests poor renal outcome. Clinicians should be aware of this condition in order to give proper care to systemic lupus erythematosus patients.",

The histopathologic features of colchicine toxicity in gastrointestinal biopsies have not been reported. Twenty-one gastrointestinal mucosal biopsies obtained from nine patients receiving oral colchicine therapy were studied. Immunohistochemical staining for Ki67 proliferation antigen was performed, and medical records of each patient were reviewed. All patients had a history of gout. Four patients with chronic renal failure also had clinical evidence of colchicine toxicity, and the other five patients did not. Distinct morphologic changes, seen as metaphase mitoses, epithelial pseudostratification, and loss of polarity, were seen in biopsy material from 4 of 4 (100%) patients with clinical colchicine toxicity. Three of these four cases (75%) also contained abundant crypt apoptotic bodies. These morphologic features were best seen in the biopsies from duodenum and gastric antrum, with relative sparing of the gastric body in the upper gastrointestinal tract. Ki67 staining demonstrated an expansion of the proliferating region in three available cases with clinical colchicine toxicity. These distinctive morphologic features were not seen in the five patients without clinical colchicine toxicity. These results indicate that colchicine toxicity can produce diagnostic morphologic features in gastrointestinal mucosal biopsies. Recognition of these features is important because colchicine toxicity can be fatal if undiagnosed clinically.",

This approach allows the accurate measurement of specific cell types and their spatial distribution in a thick section spanning the entire length of the biopsy. By uncovering specific disease signatures, including rare occurrences, and linking them to the biology in situ, this approach will enhance our understanding of disease pathogenesis. Furthermore, by providing accurate quantitation of cellular events, 3D cytometry may improve the accuracy of prognosticating the clinical course and response to therapy. Therefore, large-scale 3D imaging and cytometry of kidney biopsy is poised to become a bridge towards personalized medicine for patients with kidney disease.",

A 69-year-old man was referred because of progressive renal failure two months after major angiography for occlusive arterial disease of lower limbs. The physical examination on admission revealed an uncontrollable hypertension. The laboratory findings showed elevated serum creatinine (7.5 mg\/dl) and eosinophilia (1022\/mm3) with normal urinalysis findings. Renal biopsy disclosed a occlusive lesion of the arcuate artery which contained cholesterol clefts and foam cells, and showed ischemic renal parenchymal changes. These findings were compatible with cholesterol atheroembolic renal disease. In spite of the aggressive medical treatment, renal function had deteriorated progressively and the patient has been on regular hemodialysis. Atheroembolic renal failure after arteriography have been reported recently, but the case diagnosed by renal biopsy has been rare. Since there is no therapeutic way to reverse this type of renal failure, strict selection of patients for the angiographic examination and use of flexible catheter might be mandatory.

One hundred forty-two healthy women of similar age and ethnic composition served as control subjects. In all subjects, the proportions of mineralized bone, osteoid, and porosity (nonbone soft tissue) were measured separately in cortical and cancellous bone tissue, from intact full-thickness biopsies of the ilium, representative of the axial skeleton. The results were related to the volumes of cortical and cancellous bone tissue separately and to the volume of the entire biopsy core. Approximately three-quarters of the patients had measurements in the appendicular skeleton by single photon absorptiometry of the radius and morphometry of the metacarpal. Disease effects did not differ significantly between ethnic groups. Mineralized cortical bone volume (per unit of core volume) was reduced by approximately 45% in both patient groups. Mineralized cancellous bone volume was significantly increased by 36% in the patients with OF and nonsignificantly reduced by 9% in the patients with OM; however, the reduction in the latter patients was significant in relation to tissue volume. The combined total deficit for both types of iliac bone was approximately 20% in the patients with OF and approximately 40% in the patients with OM. Significant reductions in appendicular cortical bone were demonstrated in both patient groups at both measurement sites. Regardless of the current histologic classification, the major structural abnormality in the skeleton is generalized thinning of cortical bone due to increased net endocortical resorption, the most characteristic effect on bone of hyperparathyroidism. Protection of the skeleton from the adverse consequences of renal failure will require therapeutic intervention in patients with no symptoms of either renal or bone disease.",

We have previously described the renal morphology in 8 patients from El Salvador. To confirm the renal pathology, we have studied kidney biopsies from patients with MeN in Nicaragua. Follow-up urine and blood samples from both biopsy studies were collected to investigate the natural history.\nSTUDY DESIGN: Case series.\nSETTINGS & PARTICIPANTS: In the kidney biopsy study, 19 male sugarcane workers in Nicaragua with suspected MeN were investigated with questionnaires, kidney biopsies, and blood and urine analysis. Inclusion criteria were age 20 to 65 years and plasma creatinine level of 1.13 to 2.49mg\/dL or estimated glomerular filtration rate (eGFR) of 30 to 80mL\/min\/1.73m. Exclusion criteria were proteinuria with protein excretion > 3g\/24 h, uncontrolled hypertension, diabetes mellitus, or other known kidney disease. In the follow up-study, blood and urine from the kidney biopsy study in Nicaragua (n=18) and our previous biopsy study of MeN cases in El Salvador (n=7) were collected 1 to 1.5 and 2 to 2.5 years after biopsy, respectively.\nOUTCOMES: Renal morphology, clinical, and biochemical characteristics, change in eGFR per year.\nMEASUREMENTS: eGFR was calculated using the CKD-EPI creatinine (eGFR), cystatin C (eGFR), and creatinine-cystatin C (eGFR) equations.\nRESULTS: In the kidney biopsy study, participants had a mean eGFR of 57 (range, 33-96) mL\/min\/1.73m. 47% had low plasma sodium and 21% had low plasma potassium levels. 16 kidney biopsies were representative and showed glomerulosclerosis (mean, 38%), glomerular hypertrophy, and signs of chronic glomerular ischemia. Mild to moderate tubulointerstitial damage and mostly mild vascular changes were seen. In the follow up-study, median duration of follow-up was 13 (range, 13-27) months. Mean change in eGFR was -4.4±8.4 (range, -27.7 to 10.2) mL\/min\/1.73m per year. Most patients had stopped working with sugarcane cultivation.\nLIMITATIONS: 3 biopsy specimens had 4 or fewer glomeruli.\nCONCLUSIONS: This study confirms the renal morphology of MeN: chronic glomerular and tubulointerstitial damage with glomerulosclerosis and chronic glomerular ischemia.

AS results from mutations in COL4A3, COL4A4, or COL4A5 genes, respectively encoding the alpha-3, alpha-4, and alpha-5 chains of type IV collagen, a major component of the renal glomerular basement membrane (GBM). The diagnosis is usually confirmed by a renal biopsy showing a thinning\/thickening of the GBM, with a longitudinal splitting of the lamina densa.\nCASE DIAGNOSIS: We report the case of a 10-year-old patient who presented multiple episodes of macroscopic hematuria. On the renal biopsy, the electron microscopy analysis of the GBM was normal, as was the COL4A5 immunofluorescence assay. Genetic analyses showed a homozygous duplication of exons 44 to 47 of the COL4A3 gene, confirming the diagnosis of autosomal recessive AS.\nCONCLUSIONS: Our report suggests that in patients with clinical evidence of AS, genetic testing should be performed whenever pathological analysis is not in favor of AS diagnosis. This will ensure that AS patients benefit from an early diagnosis, adequate treatment, and that end-stage renal disease (ESRD) onset is delayed.",

With the use of real-time ultrasound guidance, PRB of native kidneys was performed in 750 adult patients at an academic institution by an attending nephrologist or fellow between June 1983 and June 2002. All patients were observed for 23 to 24 h after biopsy for the presence, severity, and timing of complications. Biopsy-related complications occurred in 98 (13%) patients; minor complications occurred in 50 (6.6%) patients, and major complications occurred in 48 (6.4%) patients. One (0.1%) patient died as a result of the biopsy. Multivariate analysis using logistic regression found only serum creatinine at baseline predictive of a complication. Patients with a serum creatinine > or = 5.0 mg\/dl were 2.3 times as likely to have a complication (odds ratio, 2.3; 95% confidence interval, 1.3 to 4.1; P < 0.005). Complications were identified in 38 (42%) patients by < or = 4 h, in 61 (67%) patients by < or = 8 h, in 77 (85%) patients by < or = 12 h, and in 81 (89%) patients at < or = 24 h. The PRB remains a safe procedure, but the risk of complication is higher in patients with advanced renal insufficiency. After biopsy, an observation time of up to 24 h remains optimal as an observation period of < or = 8 h risks missing > or = 33% of complications.",

        "Abstract":"The role of endothelial cells in the pathophysiology of antibody-mediated rejection after renal transplantation has been widely investigated. We expand this scenario to the impact of epithelial cells on the microenvironment during rejection. Primary proximal tubular epithelial cells were stimulated via HLA class I, CD155 and CD166 based on their potential signal-transducing capacity to mediate back signaling after encounter with either T\/NK cells or donor-specific antibodies. Upon crosslinking of these ligands with mAbs, PTEC secreted IL-6, CXCL1,8,10, CCL2, and sICAM-1. These proteins were also released by PTEC as consequence of a direct interaction with T\/NK cells. Downmodulation of the receptor CD226 on effector cells confirmed the involvement of this receptor\/ligand pair in back signaling. In vivo, CD155 and CD166 expression was detectable in proximal and distal tubuli of renal transplant biopsies, respectively. The composition of the protein microenvironment in these biopsies showed a substantial overlap with the PTEC response. Cluster and principal component analyses of the microenvironment separated unsuspicious from rejection biopsies and, furthermore, ABMR, TCMR, and borderline rejection. In conclusion, our results provide evidence that epithelial cells may contribute to the rejection process and pave the way to a better understanding of the pathomechanisms of kidney allograft rejection.",

        "Abstract":"®\nWe previously reported a system for assessing rejection in kidney transplant biopsies using microarray-based gene expression data, the Molecular Microscope Diagnostic System (MMDx). The present study was designed to optimize the accuracy and stability of MMDx diagnoses by replacing single machine learning classifiers with ensembles of diverse classifier methods. We also examined the use of automated report sign-outs and the agreement between multiple human interpreters of the molecular results. Ensembles generated diagnoses that were both more accurate than the best individual classifiers, and nearly as stable as the best, consistent with expectations from the machine learning literature. Human experts had ≈93% agreement (balanced accuracy) signing out the reports, and random forest-based automated sign-outs showed similar levels of agreement with the human experts (92% and 94% for predicting the expert MMDx sign-outs for T cell-mediated (TCMR) and antibody-mediated rejection (ABMR), respectively). In most cases disagreements, whether between experts or between experts and automated sign-outs, were in biopsies near diagnostic thresholds. Considerable disagreement with histology persisted. The balanced accuracies of MMDx sign-outs for histology diagnoses of TCMR and ABMR were 73% and 78%, respectively. Disagreement with histology is largely due to the known noise in histology assessments (ClinicalTrials.gov NCT01299168).",

        "Abstract":"Chronic kidney disease is more common in areas of socioeconomic deprivation, but the relationship with the incidence and diagnosis of biopsy-proven renal disease is unknown. In order to study this, all consecutive adult patients undergoing renal biopsy in West and Central Scotland over an 11-year period were prospectively analyzed for demographics, indication, and histologic diagnosis. Using the Scottish Index of Multiple Deprivation, 1555 eligible patients were separated into quintiles of socioeconomic deprivation according to postcode. Patients in the most deprived quintile were significantly more likely to undergo biopsy compared with patients from less deprived areas (109.5 compared to 95.9 per million population\/year). Biopsy indications were significantly more likely to be nephrotic syndrome, or significant proteinuria without renal impairment. Patients in the most deprived quintile were significantly more likely to have glomerulonephritis. There was a significant twofold increase in the diagnosis of IgA nephropathy in the patients residing in the most compared with the least deprived postcodes not explained by the demographics of the underlying population. Thus, patients from areas of socioeconomic deprivation in West and Central Scotland are significantly more likely to undergo native renal biopsy and have a higher prevalence of IgA nephropathy.",

Correlation and multivariate regression analyses were conducted among percent-free PSA, body mass index, prostate size, and GFR in patients with and without prostate cancer, respectively.\nRESULTS: The mean patient age was 64.6 years, and the median PSA and free PSA were 5.64 and 0.87 ng\/ml. The mean GFR was 61.02 mL\/min\/1.73 m2, and mean percent-free PSA was 18.9%. Correlation analysis showed that percent-free PSA was correlated with GFR, age, and prostate size in the non-cancer cohort and correlated with only prostate size in the cancer cohort. Multivariate regression analysis showed that percent-free PSA was influenced by GFR (p < 0.001) and prostate size (p < 0.001) independently in the non-cancer cohort, while only by prostate size (p = 0.008) in the cancer cohort.\nCONCLUSIONS: Percent-free PSA has a negative relationship with GFR in the benign prostate group, while it does not in the prostate cancer group. Screening with current cutoff value of percent-free PSA can be applied to the patients with impaired renal function.",

The aim of this study was to examine the allograft histology associated with dnDSA in patients with serial surveillance biopsies. We retrospectively studied adult conventional solitary kidney transplant recipients from October 2007 to May 2014. The definition of dnDSA was new donor-specific antibody (DSA) with mean fluorescence intensity (MFI) >1000. The incidence of dnDSA was 7.0% (54 of 771) over mean follow-up of 4.2 ± 1.9 years. Patients with dnDSA had reduced death-censored allograft survival (87.0% vs. 97.0% no dnDSA, p < 0.01). Moreover, 94% of patients received a biopsy after dnDSA (mean of three biopsies per patient). AMR was present in 25.0% and 52.9% of patients at dnDSA detection and at 1 year, respectively. Patients with both class I and II dnDSA had the highest rate of allograft loss. The higher the sum MFI at dnDSA detection, the higher the incidence of AMR. In conclusion, patients with dnDSA without AMR at time of detection may benefit from a follow-up biopsy within 1 year because AMR can be missed initially. In addition, the dnDSA class and sum MFI at baseline appear to be prognostic. The higher the sum MFI of dnDSA at baseline, the higher the incidence of AMR.",

        "Abstract":"BACKGROUND: Acute and chronic kidney diseases are important comorbidities in People Living With HIV (PLWH). Biopsy is often pursued in this cohort with ongoing renal impairment without a clear aetiology, in order to establish the diagnosis and to guide management. Despite the importance of renal disease in PLWH, there is a paucity of biopsy data-especially in the Australian setting. Consequently, who and when to biopsy is mainly based on clinical experience. The aims of this study were to describe biopsy-proven renal disease in PLWH at our institution and to assess for correlation between any demographic or laboratory characteristics with histological diagnosis.\nMETHODS: A retrospective review of all PLWH who underwent renal biopsy between January 2010 and December 2020 at Royal Prince Alfred Hospital, Sydney, Australia was performed. All PLWH over 18 years, who were not transplant recipients were included. Demographic, laboratory and biopsy data was extracted from the electronic medical records. Basic descriptive statistics were performed, and correlation was assessed using chi square and Kendall's coefficient of rank test.\nRESULTS: 19 renal biopsies were included in the study. The majority of PLWH were Australian born (53%), male (84%) and had a mean age of 48 years (SD 13). Comorbid hypertension and diabetes were present in 74% and 21% of people respectively. The mean serum creatinine was 132 µmol\/L (SD 55) and the mean estimated glomerular filtration rate (eGFR) was 61 ml\/min\/1.73m (SD 24). The most common histological diagnosis was tubulointerstial nephritis in 5 people (24%). Hypertensive glomerulosclerosis and IgA nephropathy were present in 4 (19%) and 3 (14%) people respectively. There were no cases of HIV-associated nephropathy. There was no significant correlation between any cohort characteristics and diagnoses.\nCONCLUSIONS: This study represents the first description of biopsy-proven kidney disease in the HIV-infected population of Australia. Our results support the use of renal biopsy in PLWH with ongoing renal impairment for accurate diagnosis and to guide further management. Although a small sample size, our study is larger than other published international biopsy studies.",

        "Abstract":"Chronic allograft nephropathy (CAN) represents the main cause of renal allograft loss after 1 yr of transplantation. Calcineurin inhibitor (CNI) use is associated with increased graft expression of profibrotic cytokines, whereas rapamycin inhibits fibroblast proliferation. The aim of this randomized, prospective, open-label, single-center study was to evaluate the histologic and clinical effect of rapamycin on biopsy-proven CAN. Eighty-four consecutive patients who had biopsy-proven CAN and received a transplant were randomized to receive either a 40% CNI reduction plus mycophenolate mofetil (group 1; 50 patients) or immediate CNI withdrawal and rapamycin introduction with a loading dose of 0.1 mg\/kg per d and a maintaining dose aiming at through levels of 6 to 10 ng\/ml (group 2; 34 patients). The follow-up period was 24 mo. At the end of follow-up, 25 patients (group 1, 10 patients; group 2, 15 patients) underwent a second biopsy. CAN lesions were graded according to Banff criteria. alpha-Smooth muscle actin (alpha-SMA) protein expression was evaluated in all biopsies as a marker of fibroblast activation. Graft function and Banff grading were superimposable at randomization. Graft survival was significantly better in group 2 (P = 0.0376, chi2 = 4.323). CAN grading worsened significantly in group 1, whereas it remained stable in group 2. After 24 mo, all group 1 biopsies showed an increase of alpha-SMA expression at the interstitial and vascular levels (P < 0.001); on the contrary, alpha-SMA expression was dramatically reduced in group 2 biopsies (P = 0.005). This study demonstrates that rapamycin introduction\/CNI withdrawal improves graft survival and reduces interstitial and vascular alpha-SMA expression, slowing down the progression of allograft injury in patients with CAN.",

All patients fulfilled the 1997 revised criteria for the classification of SLE. White patients (Spanish-born) with biopsy-proven LN were selected as the study population.The cohort included 190 patients (170 female patients and 20 male) with a mean age at LN diagnosis of 31 years. Renal biopsy revealed type I LN in 8 (4%) patients, type II in 33 (17%), type III in 46 (24%), type IV in 72 (38%), type V in 28 (15%), and type VI in 3 (2%) patients. Induction remission was achieved in 85% of patients with types I and II, 78% with type III, 70% with type IV, and 32% of patients with type V. After a mean follow-up of 2391 patient-years, 62 (33%) patients developed chronic renal failure and 18 (9%) evolved to end-stage renal disease. Adjusted multivariate Cox regression analysis identified male sex (hazard ratio [HR], 4.33) and elevated creatinine at LN diagnosis (HR, 5.18) as independent variables for renal failure. Survival was 92% at 10 years of follow-up, 80% after 20 years, and 72% after 30 years.Our results suggest that biopsy-proven LN in white patients has an excellent prognosis.

        "Abstract":"Having worked in nephrology for more than 20 years, and never encountering this condition before, we came across three patients who had been diagnosed with calciphylaxis in the space of 12 months. This condition is also known as calcific uraemic arteriolopathy and is a syndrome of medical calcification of the small arteries, which leads to painful ischaemia of the surrounding subcubitis and skin (1). Prevalence of 1-4% has been estimated in various haemodialysis populations. Also 1% per year in dialysis patients has also been suggested (3). The mortality rate for distal lesions is 23%, whilst the mortality for proximal lesions is 63% (4). The pathogenesis of this condition remains uncertain. However, vascular calcium deposition is thought to be important, and raised serum phosphate levels were associated with a substantially increased risk of calciphylaxis. Although PTH levels were high, plasma PTH was not consistently higher in patients with calciphylaxis than controls (5). The important aspect of the condition for the patients is the sheer pain and distress suffered, as well as the high mortality rate. Therefore, the implications for nurses are early detection, to allow speedy treatment to take place and involvement of the multidisciplinary team to enhance care and provide as much support as possible, thus facilitating optimal outcome and comfort.",

        "Abstract":"The optimal duration of maintenance immunosuppressive therapy for patients with lupus nephritis who have achieved clinical remission has not been established. Furthermore, clinical and histologic remissions are often discordant. We postulated that continuing therapy for patients with persistent histologic activity on kidney biopsies done during maintenance and discontinuing therapy only for patients without histologic activity would minimize subsequent lupus nephritis flares. To test this, a cohort of 75 prospectively-followed patients with proliferative lupus nephritis was managed using kidney biopsies performed during maintenance therapy. These patients had been on immunosuppression for at least 42 months, had responded, and had maintained their clinical response for at least 12 months before the kidney biopsy was repeated. Maintenance therapy was withdrawn if the biopsy showed an activity index of zero, but was continued if the biopsy showed an activity index of one or more. A lupus nephritis flare developed in seven patients during the average 50 months from the third biopsy and the final clinic visit for a flare rate of 1.5\/year; significantly less than reported flare rates. Baseline clinical parameters (serum creatinine, proteinuria) and serologic parameters (complement C3, C4 and anti-dsDNA) did not predict an activity index of zero on the third biopsy or who would have a lupus nephritis flare. No patients developed end-stage kidney disease. Four patients developed de novo chronic kidney disease. There were no serious adverse events related to biopsy. Thus, at an experienced center, biopsy-informed management of maintenance immunosuppression is safe and may improve the lupus nephritis flare rate compared to conventional clinical management.",

This study was designed to investigate the long-term renal outcome of adult APIGN.\nMATERIALS AND METHODS: A total of 64 adults with APIGN were identified and divided into two groups: acute poststreptococcal glomerulonephritis (APSGN) group and acute nonstreptococcal postinfectious glomerulonephritis (nonstreptococcal APIGN) group. For the purpose of outcome analysis, 49 patients with a follow-up of ≥ 12 months were included. Univariate and multivariate analyses were performed for prognostic factors.\nRESULTS: Nephrotic syndrome was more frequently seen in nonstreptococcal APIGN patients. At the time of biopsy, the mean proteinuria of the two groups was 1.82 ± 2.14 and 4.21 ± 4.39 g\/d, respectively (p = 0.005). There was no significant difference between the two groups on microscopy. Among the 49 patients with ≥ 12 months of follow-up, the complete remission rate was 85.7%, and the incidence of chronic renal failure and endstage renal disease (ESRD) was 6.1% and 4.1%, respectively. The complete remission rate of the APSGN group was higher than that of the nonstreptococcal APIGN group. Univariate analysis showed that the prognostic factors were age, underlying disease, proteinuria, tubular damage and C1q deposits. In multivariate analysis, underlying disease was the only significant and independent inverse correlate of complete remission.\nCONCLUSIONS: The long-term prognosis for young Chinese adults with APIGN is optimistic if there is no underlying disease. The renal outcome for patients with APSGN is better than for patients with nonstreptococcal APIGN.",

However, the distribution and course of kidney diseases in elderly patients are not well known partially due to reluctance to indicate renal biopsies in those patients.\nOBJECTIVE: To evaluate the distribution, clinical features, and outcomes of nephropathies diagnosed by biopsy in the elderly.\nPATIENTS AND METHODS: Seventy-one patients (47 males, 24 females) aged 60 years or older (67.3 ± 6.5 years), undergoing biopsy from January 1990 to December 2006, were evaluated. They were grouped according to their clinical syndromes.\nRESULTS: Nephrotic syndrome was observed in 35 patients (49.3%), mainly associated with membranous nephropathy (17 patients), followed by amyloidosis and focal segmental glomerulosclerosis (seven patients each). Acute kidney injury (AKI) was diagnosed in 19 patients, and the main histopathological diagnoses were acute tubular necrosis (six patients) and cast nephropathy (three patients). Of those 19 patients, only two had a favorable course, while the others died early or progressed toward advanced chronic kidney disease. Twelve patients undergoing biopsy because of asymptomatic hematuria or proteinuria had different diagnoses, but most of them already had significant chronic nephropathy. In five patients with nephritic syndrome, the biopsies also showed several diagnoses.\nCONCLUSIONS: Nephrotic syndrome was the major indication for renal biopsy, and membranous nephropathy was the most frequent diagnosis.

Factors associated with major complications were derived from univariate analysis and then modelled by stepwise multivariate logistic regression. Based on the odds ratio, independent predictors were assigned a weighted integer. The risk score is calculated from the sum of the integers.\nRESULTS: The overall incidence of major complications was 3.2%. Independent factors associated with MC were lower pre-biopsy haemoglobin, lower platelets, higher blood urea nitrogen, documented chronic kidney disease features in pre-biopsy ultrasound (US) and the presence of haematoma in the post-biopsy US. A score for pre-biopsy evaluation included the first four predictors and stratified patients in three categories with increasing risk at higher scores (low-risk 0.1%, moderate-risk 3.0% and high-risk 26.1%). The score demonstrated good discriminative power (AUC = 0.872). The addition of post-biopsy US findings increased the discriminative power (AUC = 0.938). A higher post-biopsy risk score was also associated with a higher incidence of MC (low-risk 0.2%, moderate-risk 2.7%, high-risk 16.9%).\nCONCLUSION: The risk of major complications after a percutaneous renal biopsy can be assessed by a simple risk score calculated from readily available information.",

        "Published":null,
        "Abstract":"INTRODUCTION: Little is known about the prevalence of kidney diseases according to renal biopsy in Israel. Since updated literature worldwide emphasizes changing etiologies of chronic kidney disease, it is crucial to research and define the epidemiology and pathology of kidney disease in Israel. Hereby, we introduce an original review of the prevalence of kidney diseases in our study population, which we believe reflects the prevalence of kidney diseases in the population of Israel.\nAIMS: To investigate the prevalence of kidney diseases diagnosed by renal biopsy, according to age, gender, race and clinical symptoms.\nMETHODS: A total of 155 kidney biopsies were conducted in the years 2000-2014 in Bnai-Zion Medical Center in Haifa, according to formal accepted indications. Most of the biopsies (65%) were needle aspirations in a retroperitoneal approach, in which 90% were ultrasound guided and the rest computed tomography guided, while the other 35% of biopsies involved laparoscopic approaches.\nRESULTS: The most common indications for kidney biopsy were nephrotic syndrome, nephritic syndrome and proteinuria (37.4%, 25.8% and 24.5%, respectively). Average glomeruli number per biopsy was 17.5 vs. 82.2 for needle aspiration and laparoscopic approach, respectively (statistically significant). The most common diagnosis was focal segmental glomerulosclerosis (FSGS), followed by chronic glomerulonephritis, IgA nephropathy, lupus nephritis, minimal change disease (MCD), membranous nephropathy and tubulointerstitial disease (20%, 11.5%, 11.5%, 10.1%, 9.5%, 8.1% and 6.1%, respectively).\nCONCLUSIONS: FSGS was the most common diagnosis in patients presented with nephrotic syndrome or proteinuria, men, and patients above 60 years of age. Patients below 30 years of age were mainly diagnosed with IgA nephropathy.\nDISCUSSION: In recent years, FSGS is becoming more prevalent compared with other chronic kidney disease especially in the older population. IgA nephropathy is still the most common diagnosis in young patients and in patients presented with hematuria. To the best of our knowledge, no data exists on the prevalence of kidney diseases in Israel, and our study is an important contribution to the epidemiological and clinical knowledge on the subject.",

        "Abstract":"['P', 'P', 'R', 'P']\n2\nCardiovascular morbidity is a major problem in patients with chronic kidney disease (CKD) and endothelial dysfunction (ED) is involved in its development. The luminal side of the vascular endothelium is covered by a protective endothelial glycocalyx (eGC) and indirect evidence indicates eGC loss in CKD patients. We aimed to investigate potential eGC loss and ED in skin biopsies of CKD patients and their association with inflammation and volume overload. During living kidney transplantation procedure, abdominal skin biopsies were taken from 11 patients with chronic kidney disease stage 5 of whom 4 were treated with hemodialysis and 7 did not receive dialysis treatment. Nine healthy kidney donors served as controls. Biopsies were stained and quantified for the eGC marker Ulex europaeus agglutinin-1 (UEA1) and the endothelial markers vascular endothelial growth factor-2 (VEGFR2) and von Willebrand factor (vWF) after double staining and normalization for the pan-endothelial marker cluster of differentiation 31. We also studied associations between quantified log-transformed dermal endothelial markers and plasma markers of inflammation and hydration status. Compared to healthy subjects, there was severe loss of the eGC marker UEA1 ( < 0.01) while VEGFR2 was increased in CKD patients, especially in those on dialysis ( = 0.01). For vWF, results were comparable between CKD patients and controls. Skin water content was identical in the three groups, which excluded dermal edema as an underlying cause in patients with CKD. The dermal eGC\/ED markers UEA1, VEGFR2, and vWF all associated with plasma levels of NT-proBNP and sodium (all   > 0.29 and  < 0.01), except for vWF that only associated with plasma NT-proBNP. This study is the first to show direct histopathological evidence of dermal glycocalyx loss and ED in patients with CKD. In line with previous research, our results show that ED associates with markers of volume overload arguing for strict volume control in CKD patients.",

        "Abstract":"Deterioration of renal function is correlated with irreversible damage in chronic diseases. Recently we described a digital quantitative histochemistry method, relying on periodic acid methenamine silver (PAMS) staining to determine the chronic renal lesions. This index was strongly correlated with progressive deterioration of renal function in grafts with chronic allograft nephropathy (CAN). Herein the method has been applied to a cohort of renal allografts which were biopsied for various reasons, we sought to highlight its value to quantify chronic graft damage. Forty-four renal allograft biopsies from 37 patients with elevated serum creatinine values (SCr) underwent light microscopic image analysis (Mediscope, Dokuz Eylül University, Clinical Engineering Department, Izmir, Turkey) of the PAMS-stained area percentage (SAP). SCr was recorded at four intervals to overcome acute effects: the under SCr value before (SCr1) and after a biopsy within 3 months (SCr3), SCr at the time of the biopsy (SCr2), and the latest value (SCr4). The PAMS-SAP scores were strongly associated with increased interstitial fibrosis and tubular atrophy Banff scores (Kruskal-Wallis test, P = .006 and P = .003, respectively). There was a moderate positive correlation between PAMS and SCr3 (Pearson correlation test, P = .04, r = .312), and a strong positive correlation between time from transplantation to biopsy (Pearson correlation test, P << .000, r = .532). The present results show that PAMS-SAP seems to be of value to quantify renal scarring in allograft biopsies, reflecting four compartments. The strong correlation with time is noteworthy especially as a probable reflection of aging of the renal allograft.",

        "Published":null,
        "Abstract":"Acute renal insufficiency is a common problem, yet one that is frequently reversible with proper diagnosis and treatment. Although it has been argued that a renal biopsy is not needed for diagnosis in most cases of acute renal failure in the elderly, other studies have shown frequent disagreements between clinical and renal biopsy diagnoses in such cases. To investigate the causes of acute renal insufficiency in patients aged at least 60 years who underwent a renal biopsy and possible correlations between biopsy findings and renal survival, we first identified all native renal biopsy specimens from patients aged 60 years or older processed at The University of Chicago Medical Center (Chicago, IL) from 1991 through 1998 and reviewed the clinical records to determine the indication for the biopsy. We then reviewed again the records of those patients who underwent biopsy because of acute renal insufficiency, recorded the primary renal biopsy diagnosis in each of these cases, and obtained follow-up information for patients who underwent biopsy before July 1996. During the study period, 1,065 of 4,264 biopsy specimens (25.0%) received were obtained from patients aged 60 years or older, and acute renal insufficiency was the indication for biopsy in 259 of these patients (24.3%). The most frequent primary diagnoses on these latter biopsy specimens were pauci-immune crescentic glomerulonephritis (GN) with or without arteritis, 31.2% of biopsy specimens; acute interstitial nephritis, 18.6%; acute tubular necrosis (ATN) with nephrotic syndrome, 7.5%; atheroemboli, 7.1%; ATN alone, 6.7%; light chain cast nephropathy (LCCN), 5.9%; postinfectious GN, 5.5%; anti-glomerular basement membrane antibody nephritis, 4.0%; and immunoglobulin A (IgA) nephropathy and\/or Henoch-Schönlein nephritis, 3.6%. Eight biopsy specimens (3.2%) showed only benign nephrosclerosis without an apparent cause of acute renal insufficiency, and another six specimens were inadequate. The renal biopsy diagnosis was in agreement with the prebiopsy clinical diagnosis (or differential diagnosis) in 107 of the 161 cases (67%) in which such information was provided. The distribution of diagnoses was similar in patients in the age groups of 60 to 69, 70 to 79, and 80 years or older, although younger age correlated significantly with improved renal and patient survival. The relative risk for progression to end-stage renal disease (ESRD) also increased according to diagnostic categories: LCCN (greatest risk) > GN other than pauci-immune > atheroemboli congruent with pauci-immune crescentic GN > tubulointerstitial diseases other than LCCN (the latter category including ATN with nephrotic syndrome). Development of ESRD correlated significantly with decreased patient survival. In summary, renal biopsy in patients aged 60 years or older with acute renal insufficiency uncovered the cause in greater than 90% of the cases and provided clinically useful information with respect to expectation for renal survival and potential treatment options.",

        "Abstract":"BACKGROUND: Chronic kidney disease has become a leading public health concern in China, as it is associated with increased morbidity, mortality, and costs. However, the overall situation regarding common glomerular diseases in China remains unclear. Hence, the aim of this study was to assess the national profile of the common types of glomerulonephritis in China.\nMETHODS: We searched Medline, Embase, Cochrane Library, CNKI, SinoMed, VIP, and Wanfang databases for English and Chinese language articles from inception to September 2017. We also collected potentially relevant studies and reviews using a manual search. The following words in combinations are as keywords: \"renal biopsy\", \"kidney pathological diagnosis\", and \"spectrum of pathological types\".\nRESULTS: We identified 23 studies involving 176,355 patients from 15 provinces\/cities in China. The detection rates of primary glomerulonephritis (PGN) and secondary glomerulonephritis (SGN) were 0.740 and 0.221, respectively. Over the past 30 years, the top five types of PGN were immunoglobulin A nephropathy (IgAN; 24.3%), mesangial proliferative glomerulonephritis (MsPGN; 10.5%), membranous nephropathy (MN; 12.6%), minimal change disease (MCD; 9.8%), and focal segmental glomerulosclerosis (FSGS; 4.6%), and the top four types of SGN were lupus nephritis (LN; 8.6%), Henoch-Schönlein purpura glomerulonephritis (4.1%), hepatitis B virus-associated glomerulonephritis (HBV-GN; 2.6%), and diabetic nephropathy (DN; 1.6%). The proportion of MN, MCD, HBV-GN, and DN tended to increase, while those of IgAN, MsPGN, FSGS, and LN tended to drop.\nCONCLUSIONS: Although the incidence of SGN is increasing gradually, PGN is still the leading form of kidney disease in patients undergoing renal biopsies in China. IgAN and LN are the most common types of PGN and SGN, respectively. Differences between regions are related to various factors such as nationality, environment, and diet. Furthermore, unified standards and norms for evaluating renal biopsies are urgently needed.",

        "Abstract":"Renal prognostic factors of chronic kidney disease are important concerns for patients. Kidney biopsy can be used to evaluate not only the activity of the original disease but also various risk factors related to the lifestyle of patients. Considering that lifestyle-related factors, including obesity and metabolic syndrome, are crucial prognostic risk factors of kidney disease progression and all-cause mortality, evaluation of lifestyle-related prognostic factors in kidney biopsy of all kidney diseases is important. Renal corpuscle size (glomerular size) is an easily measured parameter and potentially acts as a predictor of long-term renal function. Large renal corpuscle found on kidney biopsy is a classic and simple indicator, and has merit owing to its quantitative nature, but it has yet to be used to its full potential in clinical settings. Large renal corpuscle is an index that includes not only the activity of the original disease but also the damage of various metabolic risk states as represented by obesity, diabetes, and metabolic syndrome. Large renal corpuscles could be used to guide therapy. In this review, after identifying the pitfalls regarding the assessment of mean values in medical research, we propose that measurement of the maximum renal corpuscle profile (glomerular profile) in renal biopsies would provide valuable insights into the diagnosis, prognosis, and management of kidney diseases.",

Analysis of the data of this group of patients showed that primary glomerulonephritis (GN) remained the most important and prevalent renal disease in China. The ratio of primary to secondary GN was 2.75:1. However, it is declining progressively in the past two decades with an increment in the incidence of diabetic nephropathy and nephrosclerosis. IgA nephropathy (IgAN) constituted 45.26% of the primary GN, while non-IgA mesangial proliferative lesions were 25.62%. Membranous nephropathy was 9.89% and minimal change disease was 0.93%, remarkably less. The most prevalent etiology of secondary GN was systemic lupus erythrematosus (SLE) (54.3%) followed by Henoch-Schönlein purpura (20.3%), diabetic nephropathy (6.6%), systemic vasculitides (4.0%), and amyloidosis (2.2%). Based on the study of biopsy materials obtained from 607 cases manifesting chronic renal failure, IgAN was identified as the most frequent cause (26.69%) of chronic renal failure.",

Renal involvement is rare, and granulomatous tubulointerstitial nephritis (TIN) is the predominant histologic feature. TIN is also a hallmark of tubulointerstitial nephritis and uveitis (TINU) syndrome. Diagnoses of both sarcoidosis and TINU syndrome are usually made by exclusion and by combining clinical and histological findings, and often remain misdiagnosed. The aim of this retrospective study was to determine the characteristics of renal sarcoidosis and TINU syndrome in Slovenia in the last decade (2010 - 2020).\nMATERIALS AND METHODS: A thorough search of the national database of renal biopsies from January 2010 to December 2020 was performed. Inclusion criteria were TIN and a clinical history of either sarcoidosis or TINU syndrome. To compare the characteristics of our cohort with others, we also reviewed the global literature reported since 2010.\nRESULTS: 13 patients (9 female, 4 male) were included in our study. Indications for kidney biopsy were acute kidney injury (n = 8), acute exacerbation of chronic kidney disease (n = 4), and proteinuria (n = 1). Seven patients had clinical and histological evidence of sarcoidosis, and 6 patients were classified as having TINU syndrome. All patients were treated with corticosteroids. Of the 13 patients, 11 had improved kidney function 6 months after treatment, and proteinuria decreased in 9 patients. One patient was on dialysis at the time of diagnosis and remained so thereafter.\nCONCLUSION: Renal sarcoidosis and TINU syndrome are rare but important causes of kidney injury, with a favorable long-term prognosis if properly diagnosed and treated in a timely manner.",
