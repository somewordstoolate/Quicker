        "Abstract":"BACKGROUND: Optimal performance of bronchoscopy requires patient's comfort, physician's ease of execution, and minimal risk. There is currently a wide variation in the use of topical anesthesia, analgesia, and sedation during bronchoscopy.\nMETHODS: A panel of experts was convened by the American College of Chest Physicians Interventional\/Chest Diagnostic Network. A literature search was conducted on MEDLINE from 1969 to 2009, and consensus was reached by the panel members after a comprehensive review of the data. Randomized controlled trials and prospective studies were given highest priority in building the consensus.\nRESULTS: In the absence of contraindications, topical anesthesia, analgesia, and sedation are suggested in all patients undergoing bronchoscopy because of enhanced patient tolerance and satisfaction. Robust data suggest that anticholinergic agents, when administered prebronchoscopy, do not produce a clinically meaningful effect, and their use is discouraged. Lidocaine is the preferred topical anesthetic for bronchoscopy, given its short half life and wide margin of safety. The use of a combination of benzodiazepines and opiates is suggested because of their synergistic effects on patient tolerance during the procedure and the added antitussive properties of opioids. Propofol is an effective agent for sedation in bronchoscopy and can achieve similar sedation, amnesia, and patient tolerance when compared with the combined administration of benzodiazepines and opiates.\nCONCLUSIONS: We suggest that all physicians performing bronchoscopy consider using topical anesthesia, analgesic and sedative agents, when feasible. The existing body of literature supports the safety and effectiveness of this approach when the proper agents are used in an appropriately selected patient population.\n",

        "Abstract":"Five studies compared polyethylene glycol (PEG), an osmotic laxative, with placebo. In two studies the comparison was lactulose and in one study two different doses of PEG 3350 and PEG 4000, respectively were evaluated. PEG is associated with an increase in bowel movement frequency when compared with placebo. There was inadequate evidence to establish whether PEG was superior to lactulose. Data from elderly patients are lacking and data from patients with constipation due to Parkinson's disease, multiple sclerosis or opioid therapy was only evaluated in two very small studies. Severe side-effects with PEG are rare. There are no convincing data regarding the superiority with PEG in flatulence. On the whole there is a real lack of research into treatment of the chronic constipation in adults as well as in the elderly. [References: 18]\n",

        "Abstract":"Administering intravenous sedation in conjunction with intraoperative monitoring to cataract surgery patients is a widely accepted technique. Numerous articles report local sedation techniques for cataract surgery that are, in essence, abbreviated general anesthetic techniques for insertion of the retrobulbar block (RBB). Because of variations in levels of consciousness, a number of complications have been encountered with this specific patient population, ie, movement upon insertion of the RBB, intraoperative patient movement, confusion, hypotension, respiratory depression, and respiratory arrest. In an attempt to meet the specific needs of this patient population, a study comparing propofol-fentanyl with midazolam-fentanyl was initiated. Seventy-five (ASA 1 to 3) patients were randomly assigned to two groups: propofol-fentanyl (P\/F) or midazolam-fentanyl (M\/F). The mean age of patients in the P\/F group was 71.1 +\/- 13 SD, and the mean age in the M\/F group was 74.4 +\/- 8.8 SD. All patients entered the operating room unpremedicated. Before the RBB, patients in both groups were given a single intravenous dose of 50 micrograms fentanyl. Propofol (mean dose, 24.7 mg) or midazolam (mean dose, 1.58 mg) was then titrated to slurred speech or nystagmus. Patients' responses to the RBB were evaluated and recorded by an objective observer. The amnestic properties of both agents were evaluated by patient questioning at 10 minutes and 24 hours. Levels of discomfort were evaluated on a scale of 1 to 5, with 1 being extremely uncomfortable and 5 being noticeable without pain. Respiratory depressant effects of both techniques was assessed via continuous pulse oximetry. Results were analyzed using the chi 2 test, rank t test, and SD.(ABSTRACT TRUNCATED AT 250 WORDS)\n",

Forty patients were evaluated in this double-blind crossover study. Nalbuphine was shown to have analgesic, sedative, and amnesic properties similar to meperidine. Nalbuphine, when compared to meperidine, produced significantly lower intraoperative systolic and diastolic blood pressures.

Data on demographic characteristics, vital signs, laboratory test variables, drug therapy, and the presence of other known risk factors for falls were collected retrospectively and compared between the groups.\nRESULTS: Nonsteroidal antiinflammatory drug (NSAID) use was more frequent in patients who fell than in control patients. NSAID use was a significant predictor of falls and was associated with a 10-fold increase in the likelihood of falling. Opioid analgesics were given more frequently to control patients and were not associated with falls. Dementia, the only non-medication-related independent predicator of falls, was associated with a 21-fold greater risk of falling.\nCONCLUSION: In hospitalized elderly patients, there was a significant association between NSAID use and falls, an effect largely accounted for by low-dose aspirin.\n",

        "Abstract":"The biochemical bases of the placebo effect are still incompletely known. We show here that the placebo effect in Parkinson's disease is due, at least in part, to the release of dopamine in the striatum. We propose that the placebo effect might be related to reward mechanisms. The expectation of reward (i.e. clinical benefit) seems to be particularly relevant. According to this theory, brain dopamine release could be a common biochemical substrate for the placebo effect encountered in other medical conditions, such as pain and depression. Other neurotransmitters or neuropeptides, however, are also likely to be involved in mediating the placebo effect (e.g. opioids in pain disorders, serotonin in depression). [References: 61]\n",

        "Abstract":"To evaluate the effectiveness of flumazenil in reversing midazolam-induced conscious sedation and general anesthesia, we gave either flumazenil or placebo to 55 patients in a double-blind manner after surgery. Whether surgery was done under conscious sedation (CS group) or general anesthesia (GA group) depended on the procedure. Recovery was assessed by an Observer Assessment of Alertness and Sedation (OAAS) Scale, Finger-Nose (F-N) test, and picture recall and recognition. OAAS and F-N tests were done at baseline, 0 minutes (before the test drug administration), and at 5, 15, 30, 60, 120, and 180 minutes. Picture recall and recognition were tested at 180 minutes and 24 hours, respectively, after test drug administration. Patients who were sedated during surgery (CS group) received a mean of 10.3 +\/- 5.3 mg midazolam. The patients receiving general anesthesia (GA group) were given 21.0 +\/- 8.2 mg midazolam. In the CS group, improvement in scores on the OAAS scale and F-N test was similar after administration of both flumazenil and placebo. In the GA group, flumazenil produced significantly greater improvement in the OAAS scores at 5 and 15 minutes, and in the F-N test scores at 15 minutes. In both groups, picture recall and recognition improved significantly immediately after flumazenil administration, but this improvement was generally not sustained for pictures shown at later times. These results imply that flumazenil is beneficial for reversing amnesia briefly after midazolam-induced sedation. However, flumazenil hastens recovery only when larger doses of midazolam are used for general anesthesia.\n",

        "Abstract":"BACKGROUND AND OBJECTIVE: This prospective, randomized trial was designed to test the hypothesis that continuous infusion of low-dose remifentanil can provide effective analgesia, sedation, amnesia, patient comfort and stable recovery profile without respiratory depression when compared with propofol infusion during colonoscopy.\nMETHODS: One hundred patients were randomly assigned to receive either remifentanil (group R, 0.5 microg\/kg followed by 0.05 microg\/kg\/min, n = 50) or propofol (group P, 0.5 mg\/kg followed by 50 microg\/kg\/min, n = 50). Supplemental doses of remifentanil 12.5 microg in group R and propofol 10 mg in group P were given to treat complaints of moderate to severe pain and discomfort. Hemodynamic and respiratory data, pain, discomfort and sedation scores, patient and gastroenterologist satisfaction and recovery profiles were recorded.\nRESULTS: The duration of colonoscopy was longer in group P. The mean arterial pressure, heart rate and end-tidal CO2 remained stable during the procedure and were comparable between the groups. After bolus injection of the study drugs, the respiratory rate and oxygen saturation values were lower in group R than in group P. Only one patient in group R required airway support. Pain and discomfort scores were better in group R than in group P. Sedation levels were higher in group P than in group R. Group P needed more supplemental doses than group R. The time to reach an Aldrete score of nine or more was shorter in group R, but discharge times were similar in the two groups. Amnesia was better in group P. Nausea and vomiting were more frequent in group R during the recovery phase.\nCONCLUSION: Low-dose remifentanil infusion with intermittent bolus injections can provide adequate sedation, amnesia and better analgesia than propofol infusion during colonoscopy. However, remifentanil-induced nausea and vomiting may be a problem during the recovery phase.\n",

        "Abstract":"Propofol provides smooth and rapid induction of anesthesia in adults and guarantees rapid recovery. The use of propofol in adults is frequently associated with pain on injection, but this can be reduced by: (1) injection into the relatively large veins in the forearm or the antecubital fossa: (2) addition of lignocaine to the propofol; or (3) injection of an opioid (alfentanil) before propofol. Compared with experience in adults, there is very little experience with propofol in pediatric anesthesia. The aim of this random prospective study was to compare the induction characteristics of propofol and thiopentone in pediatric anesthesia. Vigilance and behavior in the postoperative period were also compared. METHOD. A total of 75 healthy children aged 3-12 years who were undergoing elective operations were studied. All the children received premedication with 0.5 mg\/kg midazolam with 0.02 mg\/kg atropine by the rectal route. The children were divided randomly into 3 groups and received: group A, thiopentone 3-6 mg\/kg; group B, propofol 1-3 mg\/kg mixed with lignocaine (10\/200 mg); group C, propofol 1-3 mg\/kg, followed 1 min later by alfentanil 0.01 mg\/kg. The induction agent was injected over 30 s, if possible into the vein in the forearm or the antecubital fossa. The immediate reaction on vein puncture and any discomfort during the injection were noted. After intubation the anesthesia was maintained with 1 vol% halothane, nitrous oxide and oxygen (2:1). Arterial pressure was measured on arrival in the induction room, immediately after the induction of anesthesia, immediately after intubation and thereafter at 5-min intervals throughout the anesthesia. Heart rate (ECG) and arterial oxygen saturation (saO2) were measured continuously. The existence of any anterograde amnesia was tested (age over 4 years) by means of one of 6 pictures shown to each before operation. The ability to recall the picture shown was recorded 2-5 h postoperatively. The completeness of recovery was assessed at 10-min intervals up to 1 h, and thereafter at 1-h intervals. In the postoperative period a recovery test (postbox test) was performed. The incidence of side effects during the induction of anesthesia and also during recovery and the postoperative period (for 5 h) was recorded. RESULTS . There was no significant difference between the children in the 3 different groups with regard to age, body weight, type of operation, or duration of anesthesia. Among the total of 75 children, 66.7% accepted the vein puncture very well, and 24% well. In some children in each group we observed obstruction of the respiratory tract (group A, 36%; group B, 48%; group C, 64%). Apnea for 20 s was observed only in groups B and C (2 and 3 children respectively). During spontaneous respiration with room air there was a significant decrease of the arterial oxygen saturation about 1 min after induction in all groups. In children ventilated with oxygen by mask, the SaO2 remained nearly constant...\n",

        "Abstract":"BACKGROUND: Pain is frequent and distressing in people with dementia, but no randomized controlled trials have evaluated the effect of analgesic treatment on pain intensity as a key outcome.\nMETHODS: Three hundred fifty-two people with dementia and significant agitation from 60 nursing home units were included in this study. These units, representing 18 nursing homes in western Norway, were randomized to a stepwise protocol of treating pain (SPTP) or usual care. The SPTP group received acetaminophen, morphine, buprenorphine transdermal patch and pregabalin for 8 weeks, with a 4-week washout period. Medications were governed by the SPTP and each participant's existing prescriptions. We obtained pain intensity scores from 327 patients (intervention n = 164, control n = 163) at five time points assessed by the primary outcome measure, Mobilization-Observation-Behaviour-Intensity-Dementia-2 (MOBID-2) Pain Scale. The secondary outcome was activities of daily living (ADL). We used a linear intercept mixed model in a two-way repeated measures configuration to assess change over time and between groups.\nRESULTS: The SPTP conferred significant benefit in MOBID-2 scores compared with the control group [average treatment effect (ATE) -1.388; p < 0.001] at week 8, and MOBID-2 scores worsened during the washout period (ATE = -0.701; p = 0.022). Examining different analgesic treatments, benefit was conferred to patients receiving acetaminophen compared with the controls at week 2 (ATE = -0.663; p = 0.010), continuing to increase until week 8 (ATE = -1.297; p < 0.001). Although there were no overall improvements in ADL, an increase was seen in the group receiving acetaminophen (ATE = +1.0; p = 0.022).\nCONCLUSION: Pain medication significantly improved pain in the intervention group, with indications that acetaminophen also improved ADL function.

        "Abstract":"The efficacy and safety of flumazenil in antagonizing the central effects of the benzodiazepine midazolam was demonstrated in patients in whom conscious sedation was induced with midazolam plus an opioid (fentanyl, meperidine, or morphine). In a double-blind, multicenter study, 240 patients were administered flumazenil postoperatively at an average intravenous dose of 0.7 mg (7 ml) and 114 patients were administered an average dose of 9 ml placebo. Complete reversal of sedation was observed in 80% of flumazenil-treated patients and 30% of placebo-treated patients 5 minutes posttreatment. In 87% of patients who responded to flumazenil, the level of alertness was maintained throughout the 180-minute observation period. Midazolam-impaired psychomotor performance returned to normal 5 minutes posttreatment in 80% of the flumazenil-treated patients and 28% of the placebo-treated patients. Flumazenil was less effective in reversing midazolam-induced amnesia, with only 70% of flumazenil-treated patients (and 15% of placebo-treated patients) able to recall the picture shown them at the 5-minute assessment, and fewer patients able to recall pictures shown at later times. Flumazenil was well tolerated, although adverse effects were reported slightly more often than in the placebo group. The most frequent adverse events in both groups were dizziness and nausea.

        "Abstract":"UNLABELLED: The purpose of premedication and the best form have been frequent subjects of controversy among anaesthetists in the past few years. Anxiolysis is now accepted as the main purpose. The preferred route of administration is by mouth. The intention of this study was to examine whether clorazepate dipotassium has the same sedative-hypnotic and anxiolytic effects as i.m. premedication with promethazine, pethidine and atropine.\nMETHODS: A total of 100 patients aged 20-65 years and due to undergo arthroscopy took part in this study. Patients in group I were given 1 mg flunitrazepam p.o. on the evening before the operation and the i.m. premedication described above. The premedication for group II consisted in clorazepate dipotassium, 50 mg on the evening before operation and 25 mg on the morning of the day of the operation. The sedative-hypnotic effects were measured on a four-point scale. The Erlangen anxiety scale (EAS) and a visual analogue scale (VAS) were used to evaluate the anxiolytic effects according to the patient's own and the observer's evaluation of mood. In addition to this, we measured amnesia, heart rate and blood pressure.\nRESULTS: Clorazepate dipotassium or flunitrazepam p.o. significantly reduces anxiety 1 h after administration as measured by the EAS (P < 0.05) on the evening before the operation. This result was not, however, confirmed by the VAS for self-assessment. Patients who received premedication with clorazepate dipotassium are less anxious on the morning of the operation than patients given flunitrazepam the evening before the operation (P < 0.05); this, however, does not correspond to the VAS results. There were no differences in the other parameters compared.\nDISCUSSION: Oral premedication with clorazepate dipotassium has the same sedative-hypnotic, anxiolytic and amnestic effects as i.m. premedication with promethazine, pethidine and atropine. The results of this study are better than those obtained by Tolksdorf et al., owing to the higher dosage used in our study (50 mg as against 20 mg). Tolksdorf et al. [21] failed to show any improvement on a placebo. Our results correspond to those of Drautz et al. [2] who used 50 mg of clorazepate dipotassium on the evening before and 25 mg on the morning of the day of the operation.\n",

        "Abstract":"We performed a prospective, randomized, double-blind study to evaluate the efficacy of the currently recommended low doses of midazolam for conscious sedation compared with diazepam for colonoscopy. Each agent was administered in a fixed ratio dose in combination with meperidine, and titrated incrementally to allow for adequate sedation prior to initiating and during the procedure. The currently recommended starting dose of midazolam (0.03 mg\/kg) proved to be very appropriate for pre-medication. In contrast, the currently recommended starting dose of diazepam (0.10 mg\/kg) proved excessive in 21% of patients (especially in those aged > 65). The low initial and incremental doses of midazolam compared favorably with diazepam in all efficacy parameters studied and exceeded diazepam in post-procedure amnesia scores (p = 0.01). Moreover, the sedative effects of midazolam at these lower doses were not lost despite long duration procedures (> 40 min). We conclude that midazolam, given in small incremental doses, in combination with meperidine, produces effective conscious sedation for colonoscopy and exceeds diazepam in its amnestic effect.\n",

        "Abstract":"The safety and efficacy of alprazolam and hydroxyzine administered orally as surgical premedicants were compared in a double-blind controlled study. Sixty-five patients were given either alprazolam 1 mg or hydroxyzine 75 mg, one to two hours before surgery. Anxiety was assessed by both the patient and the anaesthetist, the patient using a visual analogue scale, the anaesthetist employing both analogue and ordinal ratings. Sedation was assessed by the anaesthetist only, using the same two methods. Amnesia was appraised with a simple memory test. Safety was assessed by recording adverse effects and measuring haemodynamic variables. Premedication with alprazolam produced a modest reduction in anxiety (28%) (P < 0.01) while hydroxyzine had no detectable effect. The comparison of the sedation level and of the memory test revealed no difference between the two premedicants. Minor side effects were only observed in the hydroxyzine group. Changes in blood pressure were more pronounced in the hydroxyzine group. This study shows that alprazolam and hydroxyzine are safe and efficient oral premedicants. However, alprazolam is preferable to hydroxyzine in terms of anxiolytic and adverse effects.\n",

        "Abstract":"BACKGROUND: Impulse control disorders (ICDs) have become a widely recognized non-motor complication of Parkinson's disease (PD) in patients taking dopamine replacement therapy (DRT). There are no current evidence-based recommendations for their treatment, other than reducing their dopaminergic medication.\nMETHODS: This study reviews the current literature of the treatment of ICDs including pharmacological treatments, deep brain stimulation, and psychotherapeutic interventions.\nRESULTS: Dopamine agonist withdrawal is the most common and effective treatment, but may lead to an aversive withdrawal syndrome or motor symptom degeneration in some individuals. There is insufficient evidence for all other pharmacological treatments in treating ICDs in PD, including amantadine, serotonin selective reuptake inhibitors, antipsychotics, anticonvulsants, and opioid antagonists (e.g. naltrexone). Large randomized control trials need to be performed before these drugs can be routinely used for the treatment of ICDs in PD. Deep brain stimulation remains equivocal because ICD symptoms resolve in some patients after surgery but may appear de novo in others. Cognitive behavioral therapy has been shown to improve ICD symptoms in the only published study, although further research is urgently needed.\nCONCLUSIONS: Further research will allow for the development of evidence-based guidelines for the management of ICDs in PD.\n",

        "Abstract":"The power of a placebo to effect clinically meaningful neurobiological change comparable to pharmacological therapies has been demonstrated, although the mechanisms are not fully understood. Predicting placebo responsiveness has only recently received more attention, but psychological disposition, contextual and biological factors are now known to dramatically affect a person's susceptibility to the placebo effect. The placebo effect depends upon expectancies that can be modified in a number of ways, including conditioning through explicit or implicit learned associations. Based on the dopaminergic response to anticipation of benefit in Parkinson's disease, it was suggested that the placebo effect can be seen as analogous to the expectation of reward. Dopaminergic pathways have since been implicated in the placebo response in pain and depression. Additionally, endogenous opioid release is known to mediate many forms of placebo analgesia. We provide an overview of the mechanisms and the therapeutic implications of the placebo effect in neurological and psychiatric conditions. We include evidence for detrimental effects arising from seemingly inert interventions, termed the 'nocebo effect.' Neuroimaging has critically advanced the study of the placebo effect and provides some of the strongest evidence for the mechanisms of this phenomenon prevalent across an array of human health-related circumstances. This review specifically focuses on mechanisms of the placebo effect in the three conditions that have most significantly demonstrated this effect and for which a plausible physiological basis can be identified: pain, PD and depression. Other neurological and psychiatric diseases reviewed include multiple sclerosis, Huntington's disease, Alzheimer's disease, schizophrenia and epilepsy. Copyright © 2013.\n",

While the long-term benefits of opioids regarding pain relief, functional capacity and health-related quality of life still remain to be proven, studies are emerging that describe serious long-term consequences such as addiction, opioid-induced hyperalgesia, cognitive disorders, and suppression of the immune and reproductive systems.\nSUMMARY: Much more research is needed concerning long-time effects and consequences of opioid therapy in chronic nonmalignant pain patients; however, some clear warning signals have been sent out within recent years.

        "Title":"Midazolam for sedation before procedures",
        "Abstract":"BACKGROUND: Midazolam is used for sedation before diagnostic and therapeutic medical procedures. It is an imidazole benzodiazepine that has depressant effects on the central nervous system (CNS) with rapid onset of action and few adverse effects. The drug can be administered by several routes including oral, intravenous, intranasal and intramuscular.\nOBJECTIVES: To determine the evidence on the effectiveness of midazolam for sedation when administered before a procedure (diagnostic or therapeutic).\nSEARCH METHODS: We searched the Cochrane Central Register of Controlled Trials (CENTRAL to January 2016), MEDLINE in Ovid (1966 to January 2016) and Ovid EMBASE (1980 to January 2016). We imposed no language restrictions.\nSELECTION CRITERIA: Randomized controlled trials in which midazolam, administered to participants of any age, by any route, at any dose or any time before any procedure (apart from dental procedures), was compared with placebo or other medications including sedatives and analgesics.\nDATA COLLECTION AND ANALYSIS: Two authors extracted data and assessed risk of bias for each included study. We performed a separate analysis for each different drug comparison.\nMAIN RESULTS: We included 30 trials (2319 participants) of midazolam for gastrointestinal endoscopy (16 trials), bronchoscopy (3), diagnostic imaging (5), cardioversion (1), minor plastic surgery (1), lumbar puncture (1), suturing (2) and Kirschner wire removal (1). Comparisons were: intravenous diazepam (14), placebo (5) etomidate (1) fentanyl (1), flunitrazepam (1) and propofol (1); oral chloral hydrate (4), diazepam (2), diazepam and clonidine (1); ketamine (1) and placebo (3); and intranasal placebo (2). There was a high risk of bias due to inadequate reporting about randomization (75% of trials). Effect estimates were imprecise due to small sample sizes. None of the trials reported on allergic or anaphylactoid reactions. Intravenous midazolam versus diazepam (14 trials; 1069 participants)There was no difference in anxiety (risk ratio (RR) 0.80, 95% confidence interval (CI) 0.39 to 1.62; 175 participants; 2 trials) or discomfort\/pain (RR 0.60, 95% CI 0.24 to 1.49; 415 participants; 5 trials; I2 = 67%). Midazolam produced greater anterograde amnesia (RR 0.45; 95% CI 0.30 to 0.66; 587 participants; 9 trials; low-quality evidence). Intravenous midazolam versus placebo (5 trials; 493 participants)One trial reported that fewer participants who received midazolam were anxious (3\/47 versus 15\/35; low-quality evidence). There was no difference in discomfort\/pain identified in a further trial (3\/85 in midazolam group; 4\/82 in placebo group; P = 0.876; very low-quality evidence). Oral midazolam versus chloral hydrate (4 trials; 268 participants)Midazolam increased the risk of incomplete procedures (RR 4.01; 95% CI 1.92 to 8.40; moderate-quality evidence). Oral midazolam versus placebo (3 trials; 176 participants)Midazolam reduced pain (midazolam mean 2.56 (standard deviation (SD) 0.49); placebo mean 4.62 (SD 1.49); P < 0.005) and anxiety (midazolam mean 1.52 (SD 0.3); placebo mean 3.97 (SD 0.44); P < 0.0001) in one trial with 99 participants. Two other trials did not find a difference in numerical rating of anxiety (mean 1.7 (SD 2.4) for 20 participants randomized to midazolam; mean 2.6 (SD 2.9) for 22 participants randomized to placebo; P = 0.216; mean Spielberger's Trait Anxiety Inventory score 47.56 (SD 11.68) in the midazolam group; mean 52.78 (SD 9.61) in placebo group; P > 0.05). Intranasal midazolam versus placebo (2 trials; 149 participants)Midazolam induced sedation (midazolam mean 3.15 (SD 0.36); placebo mean 2.56 (SD 0.64); P < 0.001) and reduced the numerical rating of anxiety in one trial with 54 participants (midazolam mean 17.3 (SD 18.58); placebo mean 49.3 (SD 29.46); P < 0.001). There was no difference in meta-analysis of results from both trials for risk of incomplete procedures (RR 0.14, 95% CI 0.02 to 1.12; downgraded to low-quality evidence).\nAUTHORS' CONCLUSIONS: We found no high-quality evidence to determine if midazolam, when administered as the sole sedative agent prior to a procedure, produces more or less effective sedation than placebo or other medications. There is low-quality evidence that intravenous midazolam reduced anxiety when compared with placebo. There is inconsistent evidence that oral midazolam decreased anxiety during procedures compared with placebo. Intranasal midazolam did not reduce the risk of incomplete procedures, although anxiolysis and sedation were observed. There is moderate-quality evidence suggesting that oral midazolam produces less effective sedation than chloral hydrate for completion of procedures for children undergoing non-invasive diagnostic procedures.\n",

        "Abstract":"BACKGROUND: Dexmedetomidine is a potent and highly specific alpha2-adrenoreceptor agonist that induces sedative and analgesic effects over a short-term period. As a result of these benefits, dexmedetomidine may be a better alternative than other available drugs for keeping the patient's cognition state in an acceptable condition after outpatient ophthalmic surgeries.\nOBJECTIVES: This randomized study was conducted to compare the sedative effects of dexmedetomidine and remifentanil on the cognitive state of patients who have undergone cataract surgery.\nPATIENTS AND METHODS: A total of 100 patients who were candidates for cataract surgery under local anesthesia received either dexmedetomidine (50 patients; D group) or remifentanil (50 patients; R group) in a double-blind, randomized study. The baseline cardiovascular status and mini mental state examination (MMSE) score for each patient were recorded. As a loading dose, dexmedetomidine (0.5 microg\/kg) and remifentanil (0.1 microg\/kg) were infused at 10 minutes and 5 minutes before topical anesthesia, respectively. Subsequently, the maintenance dose was administered at 0.2 microg\/kg\/hour and 0.05 microg\/kg\/minutes in the D and R groups, respectively. The surgical procedure was begun when the bispectral index (BIS) reached 70 - 80. MMSE test was done at a postanesthetic care unit (PACU) 120 minutes after the discontinuation of the drug.\nRESULTS: There was no statistically significant difference between the MMSE scores of the two groups before surgery (P = 0.6), but the MMSE test conducted at the PACU revealed significantly better cognitive outcomes in the D group than in the R group in patients younger and older than 65 years (P = 0.03 and P = 0.0001, respectively).\nCONCLUSIONS: This study revealed that dexmedetomidine may be a suitable agent for sedation in cataract surgery because it results in a more favorable postoperative cognitive status than remifentanil. Likewise, dexmedetomidine had no significant adverse effects on cardiovascular or respiratory systems.\n",

        "Abstract":"UNLABELLED: An IM combination of meperidine, promethazine, and chlorpromazine (DPT) has been given as sedation for pediatric procedures for more than 40 years. We compared this IM combination to oral (PO) ketamine\/midazolam in children having cardiac catheterization. A total of 51 children, ages 9 mo to 10 yr, were enrolled and randomized in this double-blinded study. All children received an IM injection at time zero and PO fluid 15 minutes later. We observed acceptance of medication, onset of sedation and sleep, and sedative efficacy. The cardiorespiratory changes were evaluated. Sedation was supplemented with IV propofol as required. Recovery time, parental satisfaction, and patient amnesia were assessed. Ketamine\/midazolam given PO was better tolerated (P < 0.0005), had more rapid onset (P < 0.001), and provided superior sedation (P < 0.005). Respiratory rate decreased after IM DPT only. Heart rate and shortening fraction were stable. Oxygen saturation and mean blood pressure decreased minimally in both groups. Supplemental propofol was more frequently required (P < or = 0.02) and in larger doses (P < 0.05) after IM DPT. Parental satisfaction ratings were higher (P < 0.005) and amnesia was more reliably obtained (P = 0.007) with PO ketamine\/midazolam. Two patients needed airway support after the PO medication, as did two other patients when PO ketamine\/midazolam was supplemented with IV propofol. Although PO ketamine\/midazolam provided superior sedation and amnesia compared to IM DPT, this regimen may require the supervision of an anesthesiologist for safe use.\nIMPLICATIONS: Oral medication can be superior to IM injections for sedating children with congenital heart disease; however, the safety of all medications remains an issue.\n",

Ketorolac tromethamine has few sedative effects and no respiratory depression. The purpose of this study was to compare ketorolac to meperidine as adjuncts in conscious sedation for upper gastrointestinal endoscopy (EDG).\nMETHODS: Patients undergoing diagnostic EGD (n = 47) were randomly assigned to receive normal saline solution or 50 mg meperidine or 30 mg ketorolac intravenously. Midazolam was subsequently administered (as needed, to achieve adequate conscious sedation) by endoscopists who were blinded to the test substance given before the procedure.\nRESULTS: For all treatment groups, there was no significant difference in extent or adequacy of sedation, incidence of oxygen desaturation, patient amnesia, time of procedure, or vital signs (except for a relative procedural tachycardia in the ketorolac and placebo groups as compared to baseline). The ketorolac group experienced more pain and anxiety. The meperidine group experienced less gagging, a shorter sedation time, less midazolam usage, and more discomfort at the intravenous site. Meperidine seemed to offer a \"protective\" effect against procedural tachycardia.\nCONCLUSION: There is no benefit to ketorolac as an adjunct in conscious sedation for EGD. Meperidine had several benefits; however, discomfort at the intravenous site was common.\n",

In the early postoperative period 28 patients received infusion of Dexmedetomidine (0.2-0.7 microg\/kg per hour) while 27 patients--Propofol (0.3-2(system text of symbol)). Analgesia was carried out with Ketoprofen 100 mg\/12h and additional 20 mg of Trimeperidine in case of pain intensity > or = 3 points (5-level verbal pain score). Sedation and agitation level (RASS scale), speed of awakening (Aldrete score), duration of mechanical ventilation and stay in the ICU, need for additional opioid injections, type and frequency of side effects were evaluated.\nRESULTS: We didn't find any significant differences in the duration of mechanical ventilation or rate of awakening after the end of infusion between the groups. Dexmedetomidine in the majority of cases resulted in mild or moderate sedation, Propofol--in deeper level of sedation. Retrograde amnesia was reached significantly more often (p < 0.05) in Dexmetomedine group. The daily dose of Trimeperidine in Propofol group was significantly higher (8 mg and 18 mg on average, p = 0.02). Differences in side effects between the groups were noted--bradycardia (Dexmetomedine--10 (39%), Propofol--3 (11%), p = 0.004) arterial hypotension (Dexmetomedine--9 (32%), Propofol--15 (59%), p = 0.002) and general malaise (Dexmetomedine--2 (7%), Propofol--6 (24%), p = 0.001). The length of stay in the ICU in Dexmetomedine group was significantly lower (1,1 days vs 2,6 days respectively, p = 0.006).\nCONCLUSIONS: To compare with Propofol Dexmetomedine induces less sedation level and more often provides retrograde amnesia with the same duration of mechanical ventilation and awakening rate. Dexmetomedine provides its own analgesic effect and shortens the length of patient's stay in ICU. Bradycardia was noted more frequently in Dexmedetomidine while arterial hypotension, general malaise and delirium--in Propofol group.\n",

Remifentanil an ultrashort, very potent narcotic, is eliminated by plasma esterases, and does not interfere with liver function. It does not accumulate and is free of residual depression. Our aim is to find out if remifentanil can provide safe and effective sedation in ERCP, without undue technical difficulty secondary to sphincter spasm.\nPATIENTS AND METHODS: Thirty five patients, ASA I-II and III, scheduled to undergo elective ERCP were divided randomly in two groups: Midazolam-remifentanil group (group I), received remifentanil a loading dose of 0.2 microg\/Kg\/min over 5 minutes and a maintenance dose of 0.1-0.15 microg\/Kg\/min to achieve an adequate level of sedation and analgesia. Midazolam-fentanyl group (group II), received intermittent doses of midazolam and fentanyl guided by level of sedation. All patients were premedicated with midazolam 0.05 mg\/kg IV, in divided doses as per patient tolerance, before starting the procedure. Sedation was assessed depending on Ramsey scale of sedation. SpO2, blood pressure, heart rate, respiratory rate, dosages of the medications, peroperative amnesia and operative time were recorded. Operator and patient satisfaction were rated on a scale of 1 to 4.\nRESULTS: There were statistically significant differences in the level of sedation (p = 0.003), patient satisfaction (p = 0.01) and the amount of midazolam used (p < 0.01) in favor of group I. Operator satisfaction was the same in the two groups. There was no statistically significant difference between the two groups regarding the peri-operative amnesia. The technical difficulty (catheterization of ampulla, duration of procedure, need of parasympatholytics...) was comparable in the two groups, as judged by the operator. There was one case of mild desaturation in group I that responded to stimulation. No other respiratory or cardiovascular events were noted.\nCONCLUSION: We recommend remifentanil in ERCP. Vigilance, however, must be exercised in titration and supervision of patients.\n",

        "Abstract":"Our purpose in this study was to determine if the use of an instrument developed by our group to direct sedation choice improves patient satisfaction with endoscopy sedation compared to standard sedation practice. After 200 enrollments, data were available for 194 patients who completed the study. There were nine cases of dissatisfaction: five (5%) in the control group and four (4%) in the intervention group (P = 0.78). The 95% confidence intervals (1%-10%) were almost identical, indicating no difference between groups. The study was stopped after an interim analysis showed no significant difference in satisfaction between the groups. This could have been because the assumption that patients with increased risk of dissatisfaction do better with deeper sedation is incorrect. Another explanation could be the increased awareness of the value of benzodiazepines in endoscopy. Consistent with our findings, nervousness rather than pain predicted dissatisfaction, and the optimal use of anxiolytics with amnesic properties may be comparable to that of propofol.\n",

        "Abstract":"Four experiments studied anterograde deficits in Pavlovian fear conditioning following prolonged exposure to the mu-opioid receptor agonist morphine. Injections of morphine produced temporally graded anterograde amnesia characterized by deficits in contextual and conditioned-stimulus (CS) conditioning 1 or 7 days and selective impairment in CS conditioning 21 days after last injection. This anterograde deficit in conditioning did not recover across a retention interval, was absent when rats were tested immediately after conditioning, and required the presence of an auditory CS. These results suggest that anterograde deficits in Pavlovian fear conditioning emerged from differences in susceptibility to 1-trial overshadowing of context by CS.\n",

        "Abstract":"STUDY OBJECTIVE: To investigate the interaction of midazolam with different doses of bupivacaine, by comparing the analgesic, sedative, and amnesic effects of continuous epidural midazolam with two different doses of bupivacaine.\nDESIGN: Prospective, randomized study.\nSETTING: Operating room and intensive care units of a university hospital.\nPATIENTS: 100 ASA physical status I and II postgastrectomy patients (40-70 yrs) without any complications.\nINTERVENTIONS: Patients were divided into four groups (n = 25) and administered continuous thoracic epidural infusion (40 mL\/12 hr) of the drugs via a balloon infuser. The contents of the infuser (40 mL) were bupivacaine 180 mg with midazolam 20 mg (HM group), 90 mg with midazolam 20 mg (LM group), 180 mg without midazolam (HC group), or 90 mg without midazolam (LC group). As a rescue medication, 50 mg indomethacin suppository was the first choice, then IM pentazocine 15 mg.\nMEASUREMENTS: Analgesia and sedation scores, blood pressure (BP), heart rate, respiratory rate, oxygen saturation, amnesia, the number of rescue medications, and time to the first rescue medication were monitored. The area under the curves (AUCs) of analgesia and sedation scores, and BP were calculated.\nMAIN RESULTS: In the HM group, significantly better analgesia and sedation were obtained and the number of rescue medications given was the lowest of the four groups. The time to the first rescue medication was longest in the HM group, followed by the LM group, then the HC, and, finally, LC groups. The numbers of the patients with amnesia were greater in the HM and LM groups than the HC and LC groups. Blood pressure decreased significantly in the HM group but no treatment was necessary. The AUCs of analgesia and sedation scores, and BP were lowest in the HM group.\nCONCLUSIONS: Adding midazolam increased not only analgesic but also sedative effect with increasing dose of bupivacaine in a postoperative continuous epidural administration.\n",

Patients in the TIVA group with reversal received midazolam-alfentanil reversed with flumazenil (Group 1), the TIVA group without reversal received midazolam-alfentanil reversed with placebo (Group 2), and patients in the neurolept group received anesthesia using thiopental sodium, droperidol, fentanyl, and N2O (Group 3).\nMEASUREMENTS AND MAIN RESULTS: Recovery was assessed by an observer blinded to the treatment allocation, using a Modified Steward Recovery Score and judgment of orientation and comprehension, collaboration and degree of sedation for the first 4 hours after extubation. Arterial blood gases were measured 30 minutes after extubation. A questionnaire regarding the degree of perioperative amnesia was presented to the patients 4 and 24 hours after surgery. The recovery scores were better in the TIVA group with reversal than in the other two groups from 0 to 30 minutes postoperatively. No difference between the groups could be found thereafter, although after 30 minutes some resedation occurred in the TIVA group with reversal. The median injected amount of flumazenil in Group 1 was 0.5 mg. Respiratory depression (breathing frequency below 10 breaths\/min) was reversed with naloxone in one patient in the TIVA group with reversal, five patients in the TIVA group without reversal, and no patient in the neurolept group (p < 0.001). On blood gas analysis, there was no evidence of hypoxemia or carbon dioxide retention. No difference was seen between the groups regarding consumption of analgesics, degree of amnesia, or patient rating of the quality of anesthesia. One patient in Group 2, however, recorded awareness at skin incision when questioned 4 hours after the operation, but could not recall this 20 hours later.\nCONCLUSIONS: TIVA with midazolam and alfentanil can be used for major gynecologic surgery. Recovery in the neurolept group was equal to recovery in the TIVA group without reversal, and flumazenil improves the recovery after midazolam anesthesia. Overall, in comparison with the neurolept technique no major advantage could be demonstrated using TIVA with midazolam-alfentanil.\n",

In order to compare the effects of tiapride on the incidence of visionary dreams, hallucinations and dyslepsic syndrome brought about by, this series was compared with 2 further series of patients premedicated with dihydrobenzoperidol plus fentanyl (15 patients) and diazepam plus haloperidol (11 patients). Effectiveness was evaluated by means of a 10 point recovery scale (1: rate of sedation; 2: anterior amnesia; 3: comprehensiveness and collaboration test; 4: space sense and time orientation; 5: Bender test; 6: dysleptic syndrome; 7: sick feeling and vomit; 8: subjective status; 9: recovery quality; 10: dreams and hallucinations) at 15, 30 and 60 minutes after the administration of the different premedications. General tolerance was evaluated by continuous quantification of vital signs: pulse rate, EKG and systolic, diastolic and mean blood pressures. The effects were analysed with ANOVA one-way, Newman-Keuls and t-paired tests. Premedication with 7.5 mg\/kg of tiapride significantly reduced the incidence of dreaming, provided the necessary sedation and appropiate postoperative analgesia and rapid recovery of psychomotor coordination with no obvious alterations in haemodynamic parameters attributable to the selective blocking action of the dopaminergic receptors. The association tiapride-ketamine may be useful in anesthesia for day-case surgery.\n",

Induction of anesthesia was obtained with a bolus dose of propofol (1-2 mg\/kg), maintenance was achieved with a propofol infusion according to hemodynamics and nitrous oxide\/oxygen (FIO(2), 0.50). Muscle relaxation was achieved with rocuronium. The remifentanil group received 1 microg\/kg of remifentanil as a single dose during the induction of anesthesia and 0.5 microg\/kg per minute as an infusion throughout the procedure. The fentanyl group received 2 microg\/kg of fentanyl as a single dose during the induction of anesthesia.\nMEASUREMENTS: Intraoperative hemodynamic adverse events were recorded. All patients were also evaluated with regard to their recovery and the restoration of their cognitive function, recording the immediate recovery times and using the Aldrete score 15 and 60 minutes after surgery and the Hasegawa scale 6 hours after surgery. For evaluation of postoperative pain, the Numeric Pain Scale (0-10) was used.\nMAIN RESULTS: Patients receiving remifentanil had significantly (P < .05) fewer episodes of intraoperative hypertension and needed nitroglycerine administration less frequently (P < .05) than those receiving fentanyl. Immediate recovery was significantly earlier (P < .05) with remifentanil (eye opening, 5.1 +\/- 1.3 [remifentanil] and 7.2 +\/- 3.7 [fentanyl] minutes; extubation time, 5.4 +\/- 1.9 [remifentanil] and 7.8 +\/- 4.1 [fentanyl] minutes). The Hasegawa Dementia Scale scores 6 hours after surgery and Aldrete scores 15 and 60 minutes after surgery did not differ significantly between the 2 groups. Pain levels were also similar for patients taking remifentanil and fentanyl.\nCONCLUSIONS: Although intraoperative hemodynamics were better preserved and immediate recovery was more rapid with remifentanil, overall postoperative recovery and restoration of cognitive functions as well as postoperative pain intensity seem to be similar for patients receiving remifentanil and for those receiving fentanyl combined with propofol for carotid endarterectomy operations.\n",

Twenty-two children, aged 24 to 178 months, were enrolled and 18 (81.8%) completed the double-blind, crossover trial. Each child received intravenous premedication with either meperidine 2 mg\/kg and midazolam 0.1 mg\/kg (MM) or atropine 0.01 mg\/kg, midazolam 0.05 mg\/kg, and ketamine 1.5 mg\/kg (KM) on one occasion followed by the alternative regimen on a second occasion. The initial premedication regimen was chosen by random assignment.\nRESULTS: Efficacy was assessed by a trained observer using the Observational Scale of Behavioral Distress-Revised (OSBD-R). Operator, nurse, parent, and patient opinions of efficacy were recorded on a visual analog scale (VAS). Side effects were monitored by pulse oximetry, nasal end-tidal capnography, and serial blood pressure measurements. Use of KM resulted in significantly less procedural distress than MM (1.37 +\/- 2.20 v 7.04 +\/- 8.06 OSBD-R units; P < .05). Both operators and nurses rated KM more effective than MM. KM use was associated with earlier readiness for the procedure (19.2 v 24.0 minutes) and more rapid recovery (39.3 v 74.6 minutes for removal of monitoring devices and 58.5 v 87.1 minutes for discharge). Procedures undertaken after ketamine sedation were associated with fewer side effects than observed with MM sedation (hypoxia, 17.7% v 82.4%; hypotension, 16.6% v 55.6%; reduced respiratory rate, 0% v 38.9%). The incidence of emergence reactions or behavioral abnormalities within 24 hours postprocedure was similar in both treatment groups. At 7 days postprocedure, no child had persistent behavioral abnormalities and all children had amnesia for the procedure. Parents and children expressed a preference for KM over MM in 12 of 18 cases (P < .05).\nCONCLUSION: A premedication regimen of KM produced superior sedation with a faster onset and recovery and fewer side effects than a MM combination.\n",

        "Abstract":"BACKGROUND AND AIM: Therapeutic use of nonopioid analgesic such as paracetamol (PCM) is an alternative to opioids, so to avoid the established side effects associated with opioids, PCM is commonly used due to its analgesic and antipyretic effects. Recently, dexmedetomidine has also emerged on the anesthesia front with a potential role of providing postoperative analgesia. The present study was conducted to compare and assess the quality and duration of analgesia with PCM and dexmedetomidine using visual analog scale (VAS).\nMETHODS: One hundred patients between the age of 18 and 60 years of the American Society of Anesthesiologists grade I and II undergoing laparoscopic cholecystectomy surgery were randomly allocated into two groups (n = 50). Each patient received either 1 g intravenous PCM, in 100 ml solution before incision (Group I), or i.v. dexmedetomidine 1 mug\/kg as bolus over 10 min followed by infusion of 0.5 mug\/kg\/h (Group II). Postoperatively, the following parameters were observed: quality and duration of analgesia, hemodynamic parameters, time to the first dose of rescue analgesia, sedation, and any postoperative complication or side effects. Statistical analysis was carried out using an unpaired t-test for quantitative parameters and nonparametric data using Wilcoxon signed-rank test and Mann-Whitney U-test. Qualitative data were analyzed using Chi-square or Fishers' exact test.\nRESULTS: Postoperative analgesic requirement significantly decreased (P = 0.001), with a lower score on VAS, better patient satisfaction scores, and Ramsay Sedation Score ranges from 3 to 5 (62%) in Group I. The incidence of nausea and vomiting, hypotension, and bradycardia was comparable in both the groups except shivering, which was found significantly less in Group II.\nCONCLUSION: Incorporation of dexmedetomidine as a part of multimodal analgesia provides better hemodynamic profile, analgesic, sedative, and amnesic properties along with negligible serious adverse effects.\n",

Levels of sedation and analgesia were semi-quantitatively scored using visual analog scales, and amnesia profiles were qualitatively evaluated.\nRESULTS: Combining midazolam with either fentanyl or propofol resulted in acceptable sedative and analgesic effects compared to treatment with midazolam alone (P < 0.001), with the combination with propofol giving more favorable results. More patients receiving the propofol combination became amnestic to the procedure than patients receiving the fentanyl combination. However, midazolam combined with propofol disturbed the pulse rate (P < 0.05) and blood pressure (P < 0.001) more significantly than a combination with fentanyl, or midazolam alone.\nCONCLUSION: The combination of midazolam with either fentanyl or propofol allowed patients to undergo colonoscopy under comparable sedative and analgesic conditions.

        "Abstract":"Total intravenous anaesthesia with midazolam and alfentanil, reversed with the benzodiazepine antagonist flumazenil, was studied in patients admitted for outpatient gynaecological dilatation and curettage. One hundred patients were randomly allocated to four groups with different anaesthetic techniques: I: alfentanil and thiopentone induction, 66% N2O maintenance; II: alfentanil and midazolam sedation prior to isoflurane and N2O induction and maintenance; III: midazolam and alfentanil induction; oxygen\/air, placebo reversal; IV: midazolam and alfentanil induction, oxygen\/air, flumazenil reversal. All methods of anaesthesia proved satisfactory with no serious side-effects or complications. Induction was faster in Group I (26 s) compared with Group III and IV (37-38 s) and Group I (62 s). Respiration was less depressed in Group II compared with the other groups. Recovery function was better in Group IV during the first 30 postoperative min and worse in Group III during the first 120 postoperative min compared with the other groups. Reduced performances in P-deletion and 4-choice reaction-time tests in the midazolam patients were not reversed by 0.5 mg flumazenil, suggesting that flumazenil did not antagonize all benzodiazepine effects in our patients. Postoperative amnesia was most pronounced in Group III. There was no significant difference in patient function 7 h postoperatively, at home in the evening or during the next days. We conclude that total intravenous anaesthesia with alfentanil and midazolam with flumazenil reversal is a promising technique for short outpatient anaesthetic procedures.\n",

Forty-three ASA I or II patients between 17 and 50 years of age undergoing major abdominal or orthopedic procedures were studied. The propofol group received alfentanil 50 mg\/kg followed by propofol 1 mg\/kg for anesthesia induction. Continuous propofol infusion was initiated at induction using 170 mg\/kg\/min for 10 minutes, followed by 130 mg\/kg\/min for 10 minutes, then maintained at 100 mg\/kg\/min until 10 minutes before the end of surgery. Ventilation was supported with an air-oxygen mixture. The group receiving balanced anesthesia received alfentanil 1 mg\/kg, and anesthesia was induced with sodium thiopental 4 mg\/kg. A 1% isoflurane inhalation with air-oxygen was initiated immediately upon induction. Both groups received a continuous infusion of alfentanil titrated to maintain heart rate within 10% of preinduction levels. Recovery from anesthesia was measured using a subjective pain assessment, a verbal fluency test, and a short-term memory test. No differences were detected in the rate of recovery at 30 minutes or 60 minutes postextubation. Hemodynamic stability during induction and intubation was slightly better in the propofol group than in the isoflurane group. One episode each of intraoperative awareness and delayed eye opening occurred in the propofol group. Total intravenous anesthesia using propofol and alfentanil is just as effective as a balanced inhalation anesthetic and provides equally rapid recovery. However, practitioners are cautioned to include an amnestic adjuvant when using propofol as the sole anesthetic agent.\n",

        "Title":"Interactions between midazolam and remifentanil during monitored anesthesia care",
        "Abstract":"BACKGROUND: Remifentanil, an ultra-short-acting opioid analgesic, may be useful as an intravenous adjuvant to local anesthesia for treating patient discomfort and pain during monitored anesthesia care (MAC). However, the remifentanil dose requirements, interactions with other commonly used sedative drugs (such as midazolam), and recovery characteristics after ambulatory procedures have not been determined. Therefore, this study was designed to evaluate the safety and efficacy of remifentanil alone and in combination with different doses of midazolam during MAC.\nMETHODS: Eighty-one healthy consenting women scheduled for elective breast biopsy procedures were randomly assigned to one of four treatment groups according to an institutional review board-approved, double-blind, placebo-controlled protocol. The study medication (containing either saline or 2 mg, 4 mg, or 8 mg of midazolam) was administered intravenously 5 min before starting an infusion of remifentanil at 0.1 microgram.kg-1.min-1. The remifentanil infusion was subsequently adjusted in 0.025- and 0.05-microgram.kg-1.min-1 increments to maintain patient comfort and adequate ventilation during the operation. The level of sedation was assessed at 1- to 10-min intervals during the procedure using the inverted observer's assessment of alertness\/sedation (OAA\/S) scale, with a score of 1 = awake, alert to 5 = asleep, unarousable. Discomfort and pain were assessed using numerical rating scales. Hemoglobin oxygen saturation, respiratory rate, blood pressure (systolic, diastolic, mean), and heart rate were monitored at 1- to 5-min intervals. Intraoperative amnesia was assessed by asking patients to recall a picture shown 5 min after the study medication was administered. Recovery was evaluated using the Aldrete score and the times to \"home readiness\" and actual discharge. Side effects and patient satisfaction were assessed in a follow-up telephone interview on the first postoperative day.\nRESULTS: Midazolam produced dose-dependent increases in the median level of sedation. Remifentanil produced a greater reduction in respiratory rate in the 4-mg and 8-mg midazolam groups. However, there were no significant differences in the hemodynamic variables or discharge times. Patients with OAA\/S scores of 1 to 3 (\"light\" sedation) 5 min after the study medication experienced a greater incidence of intraoperative pruritus and postoperative nausea and vomiting (PONV) compared with those with OAA\/S scores of 4 to 5 (\"deep\" sedation). Discharge times were prolonged for patients in the light sedation group in whom PONV developed.\nCONCLUSIONS: Use of remifentanil alone for MAC did not provide optimal sedation during local anesthesia. However, 0.05 to 0.1 microgram.kg-1.min-1 remifentanil in combination with 2 mg midazolam given intravenously, provided effective sedation and analgesia during MAC in healthy patients classified as American Society of Anesthesiologists status 1 to 2. Midazolam also produced dose-dependent potentiation of remifentanil's depressant effect on respiratory rate. In outpatients receiving a combination of midazolam and remifentanil during local anesthesia, the level of sedation appears to influence the incidence of both intraoperative pruritus and PONV.\n",

        "Abstract":"In 340 male and 450 female patients of various age the depth of anaesthesia acquired during induction with nitrous oxide (75%) and oxygen (25%) was investigated by means of clinical methods. Premedication consisted of atropine (0,1 mg\/1o kg body weight) in 26% and atropine plus pethidine (or morphine) in 74% of the patients, respectively of the total, 2.4% of the patients failed to enter the analgesic-amnestic level, determined as I-3, while 97.6% occupied and more than 50% of the patients surpassed it. Thus the MAC of nitrous oxide in man seems to be 75 volume per cent or less. The depth of anaesthesia varied significantly with duration of inhalation (p smaller than 0.001). Up to five minutes of inhalation 5% of the patients failed to arrive at I-3, while 95% reached this plane and 46% surpassed it. After more than five minutes of inhalation the corresponding values were 1%, 99% and 56%, respectively. Significantly deeper levels of anaesthesia were acquired by females than by males (p smaller than 0.001) during the initial 10 minutes of inhalation. After that time sexual differences disappeared. Patients of good physical condition reached deeper planes of anaesthesia than bad risk cases (p smaller than 0.001). The use of analgesics as premedicants reduced the effectiveness of nitrous oxide, as compared to premedicated patients with atropine alone (p smaller than 0.01 in men and p smaller than 0.05 in women). Adults below 30 years of age entered the stages II and III-1 significantly less frequently than older patients (p smaller than 0.01), whereas children (up to 14 years of age) reached those stages significantly more frequently than adult patients in general (p smaller than 0.01).\n",

Awake blind nasotracheal intubation requires sufficient patient co operation and comfort. Presently available short-acting analgesics and amnesics are excellent choices for this exercise.\nSTUDY DESIGN: This prospective randomized double blind study was designed to determine an appropriate dosage of fentanyl for awake blind nasotracheal intubation. We compared two different dosage of fentanyl. Eighty patients were randomly assigned to receive midazolam 0.05 mg\/kg and fentanyl 2mug\/kg in bolus (group I), or midazolam 0.05 mg\/kg, fentanyl 3mug\/kg in bolus (group II).\nRESULTS: Both dosage regimen ensured patient comfort and sedation. Patients in group II were more calm and sedated as compared to group I. Hemodynamics was also more stable in group II.\nCONCLUSION: For awake blind nasotracheal intubation, we therefore recommend midazolam 0.05mg\/kg plus fentanyl 3mug\/kg in bolus.\n",

        "Abstract":"Endogenous opioid and non-opioid mechanisms (for example, dopamine (DA), endocannabinoids (eCB)) have been implicated in the formation of placebo analgesic effects, with initial reports dating back three decades. Besides the perspective that placebo effects confound randomized clinical trials, the information so far acquired points to neurobiological systems that when activated by positive expectations and maintained through conditioning and reward learning are capable of inducing physiological changes that lead to the experience of analgesia and improvements in emotional state. Molecular neuroimaging techniques with positron emission tomography and the selective mu-opioid and D2\/3 radiotracers [(11)C]carfentanil and [(11)C]raclopride have significantly contributed to our understanding of the neurobiological systems involved in the formation of placebo effects. This line of research has described neural and neurotransmitter networks implicated in placebo responses and provided the technical tools to examine inter-individual differences in the function of placebo-responsive mechanisms, and potential surrogates (biomarkers). As a consequence, the formation of biological placebo effects is now being linked to the concept of resiliency mechanisms, partially determined by genetic factors, and uncovered by the cognitive emotional integration of the expectations created by the therapeutic environment and its maintenance through learning mechanisms. Further work needs to extend this research into clinical conditions where the rates of placebo responses are high and its neurobiological mechanisms have been largely unexplored (for example, mood and anxiety disorders, persistent pain syndromes or even Parkinson disease and multiple sclerosis). The delineation of these processes within and across diseases would point to biological targets that have not been contemplated in traditional drug development.\n",

Two hundred and ninety-nine patients undergoing physical check-up were randomized to receive intramuscular meperidine 50 mg and Hyoscine-N-Butylbromide (buscopan) 20 mg (Group IM-MB, n = 57) or intravenous midazolam 0.05 mg\/kg, meperidine 1 mg\/kg and buscopan 20 mg (Group IV-MMB, n = 242) before colonoscopy. All patients were closely observed and arterial oxygen saturations (SaO2) were monitored with pulse oximeter in Group IV-MMB. The demographic data of both groups were similar. There were significantly more severe pain responses (grimacing, moaning, shouting for pain, abdominal rigidity and body moving during colonoscopy) in Group IM-MB (51%) than in Group IV-MMB (13%) (p < 0.01). In immediate procedure recall after recovery from medications, 39% of Group IM-MB remembered severe pain during colonoscopy and only 3% of Group IV-MMB did (p < 0.01). 92% of Group IV-MMB who felt satisfactory with the medications were significantly higher than 21% in Group IM-MB (p < 0.01). Both groups significantly increased in heart rate after the injection of medications (p < 0.01). Group IM-MB increased 15 +\/- 18% and Group IV-MMB 61 +\/- 28% with significant difference between groups (p < 0.01).

        "Abstract":"Gynaecologic oncology day surgery deals primarily with the diagnosis of endometrial, cervical, vulvar and vaginal tumors. Conscious sedation is an important technique used in gynaecologic oncology day surgery. It is often associated with regional anaesthesia. The goals of conscious sedation are to provide effective pain control with complete safety, reduction of the recovery time, of the infection risk and cost. Since the consequences of the immunosuppressive effects of the opiates and the surgical stress could lead to an increased susceptibility to post-operative infections and a possible lack of immunological defence in the cancer patients, we investigated the possibility of eliminating the administration of opiates during minor operations in gynaecologic oncology day surgery. In this study, 400 patients, aged between 35 and 77 years, underwent surgery using sedation at the day hospital annexed to the Gynaecology and Obstetrics Department of the 2nd University of Naples, Italy. The patients were randomized into two equal study groups, according to a computer-generated randomised list. All patients were seen by the consultant anaesthetist three days before surgery. In all cases, during surgery, we monitored the main vital parameters such as ECG, HR and RR, BT, BP and SO. The drugs commonly used were: opioids, hypnotics and benzodiazepines, associated or not, with local anaesthetics. By using these drugs, pain and anxiety were reduced, sedation and amnesia were accomplished. In our experience, conscious sedation seems to be the best choice in gynaecologic oncology day surgery because it presents low toxicity, is short acting and readily reversible, has a low cost and, finally, because it is more comfortable for the patients. Moreover, it is possible to eliminate the administration of opiates during conscious sedation for less invasive surgical procedures.\n",

Patients tolerated cystoscopy better with intravenous sedation. Premedication with 25 to 50 mg. meperidine does not add significant analgesia or sedation to intravenous diazepam or midazolam, nor does it substitute for intravenous sedation.

If we could show that patients in American practice settings satisfactorily tolerate EGD with midazolam alone, as is commonly done in Europe, it would provide impetus for American gastroenterologists to change practice habits.\nMETHODS: We performed a randomized, double-blind trial to determine whether meperidine, used in addition to midazolam, improved patient tolerance to EGD compared with the use of midazolam alone in our academic practice setting. Safety parameters were also examined. One hundred twenty adult patients undergoing diagnostic EGD were randomized to receive either 50 mg of meperidine (group I) or 1 mg of midazolam (group II). Patients were then given additional midazolam in incremental doses at the discretion of the attending gastroenterologist to induce a state of conscious sedation.\nRESULTS: Including the study drug, patients in group I received an average of 1.8 mg less of midazolam compared with group II (mean total midazolam dose, 3.8 mg vs 5.6 mg; p = 0.037). Patients in group I showed improved tolerance for EGD compared with those in group II in terms of a physician rating of \"poor\" for the overall adequacy of sedation (7 vs 20%, p = 0.033), the need for supplemental narcotics or droperidol during the procedure (7 vs 20%, p = 0.033), the need for additional medication during intubation of the esophagus (12 vs 25%, p = 0.06), the need for a faculty member to accomplish esophageal intubation (7 vs 20%, p = 0.051), the presence of retching, which interfered with the procedure (21 vs 39%, p = 0.046), and premature termination of the exam (0 vs 7%, p = 0.055). No difference was seen in the degree of amnesia, in the willingness of patients to undergo another EGD in the future, or in cardiorespiratory parameters.\nCONCLUSIONS: In our academic practice setting, 50 mg of meperidine given i.v. at the start of the procedure improved the ability of our patients to tolerate EGD from the endoscopists' standpoint. We found no difference in cardiorespiratory parameters between the groups.\n",

The drugs were given immediately before the skin incision as a booster to the induction agent thiopentone. The response to the incision, the quality of anaesthesia and the need for supplementary medication during maintenance were monitored. A standard post-anaesthesia interview was performed to evaluate the amnesic action and patient acceptability. The skin incision caused only slight increase in arterial pressure and heart rate in both groups. Only six patients of the diazepam group reacted to the incision with defensive movements. The overall quality of anaesthesia was better (P less than 0.05) and the need for supplementary doses of pethidine lower (P less than 0.01) in the flunitrazepam group. Recovery was equally good and the duration of sleep after operation was the same in both groups. The frequency of nausea after operation was low. The post-anaesthesia interview revealed that flunitrazepam possesses a more specific anterograde amnesic action than diazepam. Acceptability of the anaesthesia to the patient was equally good in both groups.\n",

The control group received usual treatment and care.\nMAIN OUTCOME MEASURES: Primary outcome measure was agitation (scores on Cohen-Mansfield agitation inventory). Secondary outcome measures were aggression (scores on neuropsychiatric inventory-nursing home version), pain (scores on mobilisation-observation-behaviour-intensity-dementia-2), activities of daily living, and cognition (mini-mental state examination).\nRESULTS: Agitation was significantly reduced in the intervention group compared with control group after eight weeks (repeated measures analysis of covariance adjusting for baseline score, P < 0.001): the average reduction in scores for agitation was 17% (treatment effect estimate -7.0, 95% confidence interval -3.7 to -10.3). Treatment of pain was also significantly beneficial for the overall severity of neuropsychiatric symptoms (-9.0, -5.5 to -12.6) and pain (-1.3, -0.8 to -1.7), but the groups did not differ significantly for activities of daily living or cognition.\nCONCLUSION: A systematic approach to the management of pain significantly reduced agitation in residents of nursing homes with moderate to severe dementia. Effective management of pain can play an important part in the treatment of agitation and could reduce the number of unnecessary prescriptions for psychotropic drugs in this population.

        "Abstract":"Placebos have long been considered a nuisance in clinical research, for they have always been used as comparators for the validation of new treatments. By contrast, today they represent an active field of research, and, due to the involvement of many mechanisms, the study of the placebo effect can actually be viewed as a melting pot of concepts and ideas for neuroscience. There is not a single placebo effect, but many, with different mechanisms across different medical conditions and therapeutic interventions. Expectation, anxiety, and reward are all involved, as well as a variety of learning phenomena and genetic variants. The most productive models to better understand the neurobiology of the placebo effect are pain and Parkinson's disease. In these medical conditions, several neurotransmitters have been identified, such as endogenous opioids, cholecystokinin, dopamine, as well as lipidic mediators, for example, endocannabinoids and prostaglandins. Since the placebo effect is basically a psychosocial context effect, these data indicate that different social stimuli, such as words and therapeutic rituals, may change the chemistry of the patient's brain, and these effects are similar to those induced by drugs.

We aimed to compare the efficacy of midazolam with that of midazolam+meperidine, which provided comfort for the patient during ERCP.\nMATERIALS AND METHODS: The patients were randomized to sedation with midazolam only (2.87+\/-0.67 mg) (n=48, median age 55.54+\/-14.66, 21 women, 27 men) or midazolam (1.82+\/-0.71 mg) with meperidine (42.81+\/-14.61 mg) (n= 48, median age 55.48+\/-2.57, 20 women, 28 men). Procedure-related parameters and the efficacy of sedation as assessed by the endoscopist and the patients were compared.\nRESULTS: Prior endoscopic history, preprocedure anxiety scores, age, sex, baseline vital signs and type of interventions were similar in both groups. Sedation level, duration of procedure and recovery time were comparable in both groups. Sedation quality assessment scale was significantly higher in the midazolam with meperidine group. Degree of pain sensed during the procedure was significantly lower in the midazolam with meperidine group. Midazolam with meperidine group had better patient satisfaction. Twenty-four hours after the procedure, the degree of amnesia between both sedation groups was similar. The number of patients unwilling to repeat the procedure was distinctly higher in midazolam group. Development of hypoxia and arrythmia in the midazolam and midazolam with meperidine groups were comparable. Two patients in the midazolam group developed paradoxical agitation.\nCONCLUSIONS: Conscious sedation for ERCP can be successfully and safely achieved by using either only midazolam or a low dose of midazolam with meperidine. Adding of meperidine to midazolam resulted in better patient and endoscopist comfort.\n",

This work investigates the impacts of different types of exercise on learning and memory in morphine-dependent rats.\nMAIN METHODS: Forty morphine-dependent rats were randomly divided into five groups: sedentary-dependent (Sed-D), endurance exercise-dependent (En-D), strength exercise-dependent (St-D), and combined (concurrent) exercise-dependent (Co-D). Healthy rats were used as controls (Con). After 10weeks of regular exercise (endurance, strength, and concurrent; each five days per week), spatial and aversive learning and memory were assessed using the Morris water maze and shuttle box tests.\nKEY FINDINGS: The results showed that morphine addiction contributes to deficits in spatial learning and memory. Furthermore, each form of exercise training restored spatial learning and memory performance in morphine-dependent rats to levels similar to those of healthy controls. Aversive learning and memory during the acquisition phase were not affected by morphine addiction or exercise, but were significantly decreased by morphine dependence. Only concurrent training returned the time spent in the dark compartment in the shuttle box test to control levels.\nSIGNIFICANCE: These findings show that different types of exercise exert similar effects on spatial learning and memory, but show distinct effects on aversive learning and memory. Further, morphine dependence-induced deficits in cognitive function were blocked by exercise. Therefore, different exercise regimens may represent practical treatment methods for cognitive and behavioral impairments associated with morphine-related disease. Copyright © 2016 Elsevier Inc.

Despite effective therapy, ECT-induced seizure could cause several adverse effects including cognitive disorders and memory impairment. Drugs such as thiopental, which have been prescribed for anesthesia required for ECT, are known as drugs with cognitive effects. This pilot randomized clinical trial tried to assess the feasibility of using a lower dose of thiopental in combination with remifentanil instead of a higher challenging dose of a single drug with cognitive side effects such as thiopental. We evaluated post-ECT cognitive impairment in patients who received remifentanil-thiopental compared with thiopental-placebo group.\nPATIENTS AND METHODS: One hundred twenty patients with psychiatric disorders between the ages of 18 and 60 years were enrolled. The patients were randomized into 2 groups who received either thiopental sodium (4 mg\/kg) and remifentanil (1 mug\/kg) or thiopental sodium (3 mg\/kg, placebo). The psychiatric patients were examined using mini-mental state examination in terms of the cognitive deficits before ECT as well as 5 and 24 hours after ECT. Statistical analyses were done using Statistical Package for the Social Sciences version 16. Unpaired t test, chi2 test, and analysis of variance were used to determine the association of variables.\nRESULTS: All the patients completed the trial. There were no reports of adverse effects. In terms of depth of anesthesia measured by bispectral index, no significant difference was observed. Regarding mini-mental state examination scores, the difference was not statistically significant.\nCONCLUSIONS: Depth of anesthesia was similar between the groups.\n",

        "Abstract":"In 136 patients, who underwent induced abortion by the vacuum curettage method under local anaesthesia (paracervical block), the effect of 10 mg diazepam intravenously as preoperative sedative was investigated for its ability to abolish the subjective experience of pain. The trial was carried out as a paired sample, random, allocation, double-blind, fixed dose trial, and the statistical method was sequential analysis. Thirty-six pairs showed no difference and were excluded. After 32 pairs (24 A preferences and 8 O preferences), diazepam showed a significant superiority to placebo (p less than 0.05) (Fig. 1.) Amnesia for the procedure was reported by about one-quarter of the diazepam-treated patients, and in practically all cases the sedative effect had subsided 1-3 hours after the operation.\n",

        "Abstract":"Placebo (PL) treatment is a method utilized as a control condition in clinical trials. A positive placebo response is seen in up to 50% of patients with Parkinson disease (PD), pain syndromes, and depression. The response is more pronounced with invasive procedures or advanced disease. Physiologic and biochemical changes have been studied in an effort to understand the mechanisms underlying placebo-related clinical improvement. In PD, objective clinical improvements in parkinsonism correlate with dopaminergic activation of the striatum, documented by PET and with changes in cell firings of the subthalamic nucleus documented by single cell recordings. Dopaminergic pathways mediating reward may underlie PL-mediated improvement in PD. In pain syndromes, endogenous opioid release triggered by cortical activation, especially the rostral anterior cingulated cortex, is associated with PL-related analgesia and can be reversed by opioid antagonists. Covert treatment of an analgesic is less effective than overt treatment, suggesting an expectation component to clinical response. In depression, PL partially imitates selective serotonin reuptake inhibitor-mediated brain activation. Diseases lacking major \"top-down\" or cortically based regulation may be less prone to PL-related improvement. [References: 61]\n",

        "Abstract":"The use of complementary medicines, such as plant extracts, in dementia therapy varies according to the different cultural traditions. In orthodox Western medicine, contrasting with that in China and the Far East for example, pharmacological properties of traditional cognitive- or memory-enhancing plants have not been widely investigated in the context of current models of Alzheimer's disease. An exception is Gingko biloba in which the gingkolides have antioxidant, neuroprotective and cholinergic activities relevant to Alzheimer's disease mechanisms. The therapeutic efficacy of Ginkgo extracts in Alzheimer's disease in placebo controlled clinical trials is reportedly similar to currently prescribed drugs such as tacrine or donepezil and, importantly, undesirable side effects of Gingko are minimal. Old European reference books, such as those on medicinal herbs, document a variety of other plants such as Salvia officinalis (sage) and Melissa officinalis (balm) with memory-improving properties, and cholinergic activities have recently been identified in extracts of these plants. Precedents for modern discovery of clinically relevant pharmacological activity in plants with long-established medicinal use include, for example, the interaction of alkaloid opioids in Papaver somniferum (opium poppy) with endogenous opiate receptors in the brain. With recent major advances in understanding the neurobiology of Alzheimer's disease, and as yet limited efficacy of so-called rationally designed therapies, it may be timely to re-explore historical archives for new directions in drug development. This article considers not only the value of an integrative traditional and modern scientific approach to developing new treatments for dementia, but also in the understanding of disease mechanisms. Long before the current biologically-based hypothesis of cholinergic derangement in Alzheimer' s disease emerged, plants now known to contain cholinergic antagonists were recorded for their amnesia- and dementia-inducing properties.\n",

        "Abstract":"Neuroimaging studies have provided a major contribution to our understanding of the mechanisms of the placebo effect in neurological and psychiatric disorders. Expectation of symptom improvement has long been believed to play a critical role in the placebo effect, and is associated with increased endogenous striatal dopamine release in Parkinson's disease and increased endogenous opioid transmission in placebo analgesia. Evidence from positron emission tomography and functional magnetic resonance imaging studies suggests that expectations of symptom improvement are driven by frontal cortical areas, particularly the dorsolateral prefrontal, orbitofrontal, and anterior cingulate cortices. The ventral striatum is involved in the expectation of rewarding stimuli and, together with the prefrontal cortex, has also been shown to play an important role in the placebo-induced expectation of therapeutic benefit. Understanding the mechanisms of the placebo effect has important implications for treatment of several medical conditions, including depression, pain, and Parkinson's disease. [References: 111]\n",

The aim of the study was to compare the effectiveness of propofol and midazolam in providing procedural amnesia and controlling behaviour in children undergoing diagnostic EGD. Children (9-16 years), classified to the first or second class of the American Society of Anaesthesiologists' physical status classification referred for EGD, were randomly assigned to receive propofol with alfentanyl or midazolam with alfentanyl for sedation during the procedure. Within 120 min after the procedure, patients were repeatedly investigated for memory of the procedure and for memory of pain intensity during EGD with the use of the visual analogue scale. Activity and cooperation of the patient during the procedure was assessed with the relative adequacy scale. Of the 51 children, 48 completed the study. Propofol was significantly better than midazolam in inducing amnesia of procedural pain (mean difference 11.53 mm; 95 % confidence interval [CI] 0.96 to 22.10), loss of memory of the procedure (relative risk 0.4; 95 % CI 0.21 to 0.59) and controlling behaviour (relative risk 2.12; 95 % CI 1.33 to 3.36).\nCONCLUSION: In children sedated for EGD, propofol is significantly better than midazolam at providing procedural amnesia and controlling behaviour during the procedure.\n",

        "Abstract":"A great variety of medical conditions are subject to the placebo effect. Although there is mounting evidence to suggest that the placebo effect is related to the expectation of clinical benefit, little is still known about the biochemical bases underlying placebo responses. Positron emission tomography studies have recently shown that the placebo effect in Parkinson's disease, pain, and depression is related to the activation of the limbic circuitry. The observation that placebo administration induces the release of dopamine in the ventral striatum of patients with Parkinson's disease suggests a link between the placebo effect and reward mechanisms. In addition to Parkinson's disease, the placebo-reward model may also apply to other disorders. However, the relative contribution of the different neurotransmitters and neuropeptides that are known to be involved in modulating the activity of the limbic system may be disease-specific. Thus, while the placebo-induced clinical benefit observed in Parkinson's disease would mostly reflect the release of dopamine in the dorsal striatum, the activation of opioid and serotonin pathways could be particularly implicated in mediating placebo responses encountered in pain and depression, respectively.

In this study remifentanil is compared with propofol for sedation during successful regional anaesthetic blocks.\nMETHODS: After informed consent was given, 125 patients undergoing surgery under spinal or brachial plexus anaesthesia were randomized to receive, either propofol: bolus 500 microg\/kg plus initial infusion 50 microgkg\/min or remifentanil: bolus 0.5 microg\/kg plus initial infusion 0.1 microgkg\/min. Study drug infusion rate was titrated throughout the procedure according to level of sedation and side-effects. Pain, discomfort, sedation level and side-effects were recorded at regular intervals until discharge from the post operative care unit (PACU).\nRESULTS: Two patients in the remifentanil group versus ten in the propofol group were treated for discomfort or pain during surgery (P<0.02). Due to a significantly higher rate of respiratory depression (46% vs. 19% with propofol, P<0.01) the mean remifentanil infusion rate was decreased to 0.078 +\/- 0.028 microgkg\/min, whereas it was kept stable with propofol. Propofol patients had significantly higher (P<0.05) sedation levels and experienced more frequent amnesia of the procedure. Eleven propofol patients experienced pain at injection site, versus two remifentanil patients (P<0.02). Nausea and vomiting were more frequent in the remifentanil patients during infusion (27% vs. 2% in the propofol group, P<0.001) but similar postoperatively. Time to discharge from PACU was similar in the two groups.\nCONCLUSION: Propofol results in less respiratory depression and nausea when sedation is needed during a case with a successful regional block. Remifentanil may be considered as an alternative if pain during the procedure is a major concern or if amnesia is contraindicated.\n",

General anesthesia was induced and maintained with a continuous infusion of propofol. We recorded the calculated sinoatrial conduction time (CSACT), corrected sinus node recovery time (CSNRT), and AH interval when the patients were in a stable anesthetic state and compared the values before and during remifentanil administration at a moderate dose (0.2 mug . kg(-1) . min(-1)) or a high dose (0.4 mug . kg(-1) . min(-1)). Data are expressed as mean (95% confidence interval).\nRESULTS: At the moderate dose, remifentanil prolonged CSNRT (from 177 [117-237] milliseconds to 245 [167-322] milliseconds after administration; P=0.016), but had no effect on either CSACT (P=0.59) or AH interval (P=0.11). However, high-dose remifentanil prolonged both CSNRT (from 201 [144-260] milliseconds to 307 [232-382] milliseconds after administration; P=0.019) and CSACT (from 48 [31-65] milliseconds to 78 [59-96] milliseconds after administration; P=0.038), but had no effect on the AH interval (P=0.058). The interaction in CSNRT between remifentanil administration and its dose was not different (P=0.44).\nCONCLUSION: Remifentanil may inhibit both intraatrial conduction and sinus node automaticity, but it has no effect on conduction through the atrioventricular node.

Since low-dose midazolam also acts synergistically with short-acting propofol, we compared this synergistic sedation with a standard combination of midazolam and the opioid nalbuphine for colonoscopies.\nPATIENTS AND METHODS: A total of 79 patients presenting for colonoscopies were randomly assigned to the following protocols. Patients in group I (n = 32) received a median dose of 9 mg midazolam (interquartile range [IQR] 6 to 12); 20 patients (59%) needed additional nalbuphine (median 20 mg, IQR 10 to 20). Patients in group II (n = 47) received 2 mg midazolam and repeated injections of propofol (median 100 mg, IQR 53 to 145) with a maximal bolus of 50 mg.\nRESULTS: Patients treated with the synergistic sedation (group II) recovered remarkably sooner after the procedure compared with those in group I, with a median time to discharge of 17 minutes vs. 93 minutes (P<0.001). Of the patients treated with analgosedation (group I), 28 % were unable to take part in a reaction time measurement and attention awareness test 1 hour after the procedure. All patients treated with the synergistic sedation were able to participate (P=0.002), and performed better. Despite a lower proportion of complete amnesia, patients treated with synergistic sedation more often rated the procedure as comfortable (81% vs. 50 %). Quality of sedation from the point of view of the endoscopist, and cardiorespiratory parameters, were similar in both groups.\nCONCLUSIONS: Low-dose midazolam combined with propofol is an effective and economic alternative to benzodiazepine-based analgosedation. It is associated with a high degree of patient comfort and rapid recovery times, and has a potential cost benefit concerning nursing care and bed facilities.\n",

        "Abstract":"BACKGROUND: Sedative-hypnotic drugs not only increase sedation, but also impair memory as serum concentration increases. These drugs also produce profound changes in the auditory event-related potential (ERP). The ability of various ERP components to predict changes in sedation and memory produced by various drugs was tested.\nMETHODS: Sixty-five healthy volunteers randomly received intravenous placebo, midazolam, propofol, thiopental, fentanyl with ondansetron, or ondansetron alone at five different stable target concentrations (three increasing, two decreasing) using a computer-controlled infusion pump to produce varying degrees of sedation without loss of consciousness. ERPs were recorded while volunteer participants detected a deviant auditory stimulus and made a button-press response to a target tone (standard oddball paradigm, 80:20 ratio, to elicit a P3 response). At each target concentration, volunteers learned a list of 16 words. The predictive probabilities (Pk) of various ERP components were determined for word recognition at the end of the day (memory) and log reaction time to the deviant stimulus (sedation).\nRESULTS: The N2 latency of the ERP consistently predicted log reaction time in all groups (Pk +\/- SE from 0.58 +\/- 0.04 to 0.71 +\/- 0.04). The N2P3 amplitude of the ERP was the best predictor of memory performance for midazolam (Pk, 0.63 +\/- 0.04), propofol (Pk, 0.62 +\/- 0.05), and thiopental (Pk, 0.66 +\/- 0.04). There was a differential ability to predict memory performance from sedation for midazolam and propofol.\nCONCLUSIONS: Midazolam and propofol affect memory differentially from their sedative effects, and these are indexed by specific components of the auditory ERP. These components of the ERP are associated with specific, but not necessarily unique, neuroanatomic structures. Thus, these drugs act by additional mechanisms beyond general central nervous system depression to produce the effects of sedation and memory impairment.\n",

Forty ASA I-II class patients undergoing microlaryngeal surgeries and referring routinely for postoperative visits were randomly recruited into two groups. For all the patients, 0.5 mg\/Kg of propofol was used as bolus and then, 50 mcg\/Kg\/min of the drug was infused intravenously. For one group, 0.03 mg\/Kg bolus of midazolam and for the other group, 2 mcg\/Kg bolus of fentanyl was administered in combination with propofol. Ramsay system was used in order to evaluate the effect of the two drugs in inducing sedation. The need for additional dose, blood pressure, heart rate, arterial blood oxygen saturation, and also recovery time and adverse effects such as nausea\/vomiting and recalling intra-operative memories, were assessed. The patients in the two groups were not statistically different regarding the number of patients, age, sex, preoperative vital signs, the need for additional doses of propofol, systolic blood pressure and mean systolic blood pressure during laryngoscopy. However, mean systolic blood pressure 1 min after removal of laryngoscope returned faster to the baseline in midazolam group (p < 0.01). Mean heart rate returned sooner to the baseline in fentanyl group following removal of stimulation. Besides, heart rate showed a more reduction following administration of fentanyl (p < 0.02). Mean arterial blood oxygen saturation during laryngoscopy significantly decreased in fentanyl group (p < 0.05) compared to the other group. The time it took to achieve a full consciousness was shorter in midazolam group (p < 0.01). Nausea\/vomiting was significantly more prevalent in fentanyl group while the patients in midazolam group apparently experienced more of amnesia, comparatively (p < 0.01). Inducing laryngeal block and local anesthesia using propofol-midazolam regimen is not only associated with a more rapid recovery and less recalling of unpleasant memories, but also better in preventing reduction of arterial oxygen saturation during laryngoscopy compared with propofol-fentanyl regimen.\n",

        "Abstract":"BACKGROUND: Mild cognitive deficits are experienced by 18% of community-dwelling older adults, many of whom do not progress to dementia. The effect of commonly used medication on subtle impairments in cognitive function may be under-recognized.\nOBJECTIVE: The aim of the review was to examine the evidence attributing amnestic or non-amnestic cognitive impairment to the use of medication with anticholinergic, antihistamine, GABAergic or opioid effects.\nMETHODS: MEDLINE and EMBASE were searched for randomized, double-blind, placebo-controlled trials of adults without underlying central nervous system disorders who underwent detailed neuropsychological testing prior to and after oral administration of drugs affecting cholinergic, histaminergic, GABAergic or opioid receptor pathways. Seventy-eight studies were identified, reporting 162 trials testing medication from the four targeted drug classes. Two investigators independently appraised study quality and extracted relevant data on the occurrence of amnestic, non-amnestic or combined cognitive deficits induced by each drug class. Only trials using validated neuropsychological tests were included. Quality of the evidence for each drug class was assessed based on consistency of results across trials and the presence of a dose-response gradient.\nRESULTS: In studies of short-, intermediate- and long-acting benzodiazepine drugs (n = 68 trials), these drugs consistently induced both amnestic and non-amnestic cognitive impairments, with evidence of a dose-response relationship. H(1)-antihistamine agents (n = 12) and tricyclic antidepressants (n = 15) induced non-amnestic deficits in attention and information processing. Non-benzodiazepine derivatives (n = 29) also produced combined deficits, but less consistently than benzodiazepine drugs. The evidence was inconclusive for the type of cognitive impairment induced by different bladder relaxant antimuscarinics (n = 9) as well as for narcotic agents (n = 5) and antipsychotics (n = 5). Among healthy volunteers >60 years of age, low doses of commonly used medications such as lorazepam 0.5 mg, oxybutynin immediate release 5 mg and oxycodone 10 mg produced combined deficits.\nCONCLUSION: Non-amnestic mild cognitive deficits are consistently induced by first-generation antihistamines and tricyclic antidepressants, while benzodiazepines provoke combined amnestic and non-amnestic impairments. Risk-benefit considerations should be discussed with patients in order to enable an informed choice about drug discontinuation or substitution to potentially reverse cognitive adverse effects.\n",

        "Abstract":"BACKGROUND: Colonoscopy is generally performed with the patient sedated and receiving analgesics. However, the benefit of the most often used combination of intravenous midazolam and pethidine on patient tolerance and pain and its cardiorespiratory risk have not been fully defined.\nMETHODS: In this double-blind prospective study, 150 outpatients undergoing routine colonoscopy were randomly assigned to receive either (1) low-dose midazolam (35 micrograms\/kg) and pethidine (700 micrograms\/kg in 48 patients, 500 micrograms\/kg in 102 patients), (2) midazolam and placebo pethidine, or (3) pethidine and placebo midazolam.\nRESULTS: Tolerance (visual analog scale, 0 to 100 points: 0 = excellent; 100 = unbearable) did not improve significantly more in group 1 compared with group 2 (7 points; 95% confidence interval [-2-17]) and group 3 (2 points; 95% confidence interval [-7-12]). Similarly, pain was not significantly improved in group 1 as compared with the other groups. Male gender (p < 0.001) and shorter duration of the procedure (p = 0.004), but not amnesia, were associated with better patient tolerance and less pain. Patient satisfaction was similar in all groups. Oxygen desaturation and hypotension occurred in 33% and 11%, respectively, with a similar frequency in all three groups.\nCONCLUSIONS: In this study, the combination of low-dose midazolam and pethidine does not improve patient tolerance and lessen pain during colonoscopy as compared with either drug given alone. When applying low-dose midazolam, oxygen desaturation and hypotension do not occur more often after combined use of both drugs. For the individual patient, sedation and analgesia should be based on the endoscopist's clinical judgement.\n",

        "Abstract":"Anesthesia providers are unable to objectively evaluate the amnesic status of an anesthetized patient. One purpose of the study was to evaluate the anesthetized patient's ability to process auditory information while receiving an inhalational or intravenous anesthetic regimen. The other purpose was to examine the relationship of the Pa latency of the auditory middle latency response (AMLR) with the stem-word completion test as an intraoperative indicator of implicit memory formation during general anesthesia. One hundred one adults were randomly assigned in a single-blinded design to either a midazolam or sevoflurane anesthetic regimen. Midazolam was administered at 0.540 microgram\/kg per minute with fentanyl and 50% nitrous oxide. The other anesthetic regimen was 1.4% end-tidal concentration of sevoflurane with fentanyl and 50% nitrous oxide. A list of 10 words was repeated 16 times. AMLRs were recorded intraoperatively. The difference between the midazolam groups borderlined statistical significance (P = .07) in illustrating that one may potentially process auditory information while anesthetized. Dissimilar findings were found between the sevoflurane groups (P = .77). An inverse correlation was demonstrated between the midazolam group and Pa latency of the AMLR (r = -0.40, P = .047). Multiple regression of the midazolam group demonstrated that the employment status (r2 = .297, P = .005) and the Pa latency (r2 = .238, P = .003) were the best predictors of the postoperative stem-word completion test (F = 12.61, P = .001). In contrast, no correlation was noted in the sevoflurane group (r = 0.43, P = .07). Thus, the continued evaluation of the AMLR as an intraoperative indicator of implicit memory formation is warranted. With the establishment of the AMLR as an indicator of implicit memory formation during general anesthesia, anesthesia providers could then address the occurrences of traumatic neurosis in the postoperative surgical patient and strive to avoid the medicolegal concerns that may face the healthcare team.\n",

Thus, while placebo analgesia is related to the release of endogenous opioids, placebo-induced dopamine release leads to motor improvement in Parkinson's disease. A theory proposes that the placebo effect is mediated by the activation of the reward circuitry. These biochemical findings indicate that the placebo effect is real, and suggest that many ethical arguments and controversies regarding the use of placebos should perhaps be reconsidered. While it may be advisable to minimize the placebo effect in clinical trials in order to estimate the pure effect of the active treatment, acting in the patient's best interest may require maximizing the placebo effect in the usual clinical setting.\n",

        "Abstract":"BACKGROUND: Postoperative delirium is a common sequel of cardiopulmonary bypass that is hard to diagnose correctly, difficult to predict and almost impossible to prevent and to treat. The aim of this study is to evaluate the frequency of postoperative cognitive disorders and cerebral hypoperfusion in patients receiving either high dose fentanyl or thiopentone anesthesia in cardiac surgery.\nMETHODS: 50 unpremedicated patients, Class IIb-NYHA (25 patients in each group suffering from single critical LAD disease) undergoing elective coronary artery bypass grafting surgery were randomly allocated into two groups either to receive fentanyl 50 microg\/kg with diazepam 0.1 mg\/kg (Group 1) or thiopentone 7 mg\/kg (Group 2) for the induction of anesthesia. Anesthesia was maintained with fentanyl 2 microg\/kg\/hr and diazepam 0.05 mg\/kg\/hr infusion in Group 1 throughout the procedure. In Group 2, it was maintained with enflurane 0.7-1.5% before and after cardiopulmonary bypass (CPB) and with thiopentone 3 mg\/kg\/hr infusion during CPB. Neuropsychiatric evaluation (STAI-T, min mental state examination-MMSE and Zung tests), EEG and SPECT rCBF (Single Photon Emission Computed Tomography Regional Cerebral Blood Flow) studies were performed preoperatively, early and late postoperatively. The patients that were diagnosed to have postoperative cerebral hypoperfusion also underwent computed tomography scanning postoperatively.\nRESULTS: Eleven patients (9 from fentanyl and 2 from thiopentone group) were diagnosed to have cerebral hypoperfusion with respect to SPECT rCBF studies. Seven of these patients (5 from fentanyl and 2 from thiopentone) were diagnosed to be in a state of delirium clinically with MMSE tests.\nCONCLUSION: High dose fentanyl anesthesia causes significant predisposition to postoperative cerebral hypoperfusion when compared with barbiturate anesthesia in cardiac surgery. Hypoperfusion as demonstrated by SPECT rCBF studies may play an important role in the pathophysiology of mental disorders, i.e., postoperative delirium.\n",

Anesthesia in 19 was based on alfentanil, up to 0.025 mg\/kg and in 17, fentanyl, 0.0025 mg\/kg. There were no significant differences between groups with regard to age, weight, duration of procedure and pregnancy rate. There were no complications aside from nausea and vomiting. Amnesia for the puncture and analgesia were always perfect. Induction was significantly shorter for alfentanil, 1.3 +\/- 0.7 min, than for fentanyl, 3.4 +\/- 2.2 (p less than 0.01). All who received fentanyl were drowsy at the end of the procedure, while those in the alfentanil group were fully awake and able to move from operating table to stretcher with minimal help.

        "Abstract":"OBJECTIVE: Impulse control disorders (ICDs) in Parkinson disease (PD) are common and can be difficult to manage. The objective of this study was to determine the efficacy and tolerability of naltrexone, an opioid antagonist, for the treatment of ICDs in PD.\nMETHODS: Patients with PD (n = 50) and an ICD were enrolled in an 8-week, randomized (1:1), double-blind, placebo-controlled study of naltrexone 50-100 mg\/d (flexible dosing). The primary outcome measure was response based on the Clinical Global Impression-Change score, and the secondary outcome measure was change in symptom severity using the Questionnaire for Impulsive-Compulsive Disorders in Parkinson's Disease-Rating Scale (QUIP-RS) ICD score.\nRESULTS: Forty-five patients (90%) completed the study. The Clinical Global Impression-Change response rate difference favoring naltrexone in completers was 19.8% (95% confidence interval [CI] -8.7% to 44.2%). While this difference was not significant (odds ratio=1.6, 95% CI 0.5-5.2, Wald chi2 [df]=0.5 [1], p=0.5), naltrexone treatment led to a significantly greater decrease in QUIP-RS ICD score over time compared with placebo (regression coefficient for interaction term in linear mixed-effects model=-7.37, F[df]=4.3 [1, 49], p=0.04). The estimated changes in QUIP-RS ICD scores from baseline to week 8 were 14.9 points (95% CI 9.9-19.9) for naltrexone and 7.5 points (95% CI 2.5-12.6) for placebo.\nCONCLUSIONS: Naltrexone treatment was not efficacious for the treatment of ICDs in PD using a global assessment of response, but findings using a PD-specific ICD rating scale support further evaluation of opioid antagonists for the treatment of ICD symptoms in PD.\nCLASSIFICATION OF EVIDENCE: This study provides Class I evidence that in patients with PD and an ICD, naltrexone does not significantly increase the probability of achieving response. However, the study lacked the precision to exclude an important difference in response rates. Copyright © 2014 American Academy of Neurology.\n",

It is a frequently disabling and overlooked feature, which can significantly reduce health-related quality of life. Unfortunately, there are no universally recommended treatments for this condition.\nAREAS COVERED: Evidence about the efficacy and safety of available analgesic treatments is summarized in this review. Potential targets for upcoming therapies are then discussed in light of what is currently known about the physiopathology of pain in PD. Protocols for efficacy and safety assessment of novel analgesic therapies are discussed. Finally, critical aspects of study protocol design such as patient selection or outcomes to be evaluated are discussed.\nEXPERT OPINION: Preliminary results indicate that duloxetine, cranial electrotherapy stimulation, rotigotine, subthalamic or pallidum nuclei stimulation or lesion or levodopa could be effective for treating pain in PD. Similarly, some case reports indicate that repetitive transcranial magnetic stimulation (rTMS) or apomorphine could be effective for relieving painful off-period dystonia. Clinical trials with rTMS or oxycodone\/naloxone prolonged-release tablets for neuropathic pain or botulinum toxin for off-period dystonia are underway. Success of clinical trials about analgesic strategies in PD will depend on the selection of the right PD population to be treated, according to the type of pain, and the proper selection of study outcomes and follow-up of international recommendations.\n",

        "Abstract":"The purpose of this study was to investigate whether thoracic epidural anesthesia (TEA) provides better postoperative pain relief and recovery than general anesthesia (GA) for modified radical mastectomy (MRM) surgery. Sixty-four patients rated as American Society of Anesthesiologists (ASA) 1 to 3 who underwent MRM surgery were included in the study. In TEA group patients, 2% lidocaine (15-20 ml) was administered via the epidural route as primary anesthesia, in conjunction with midazolam (5-10 mg) and fentanyl (<250 microg) for amnesia. The GA patients were maintained with isoflurane and 50% nitrous oxide in oxygen. After operation the patients were given pethidine (1 mg\/kg IM) as required for pain relief. The time to first pethidine requirement, total pethidine consumption, worst pain score, bed rest time, satisfaction score, and anesthesia-related side effects were recorded for 2 days after surgery. The results show that TEA provided a more prolonged analgesic effect than GA after operation. A longer time to first pethidine requirement (19.2 +\/- 1.5 vs. 7.6 +\/- 2.5 hours) (p < 0. 001) and decreased pethidine consumption (17.2 +\/- 7.0 vs. 76.3 +\/- 17.4 mg) (p < 0.001) were observed in the TEA group than in the GA group, respectively. A worse visual analog scale (VAS) pain score was observed in the GA group (5.7 +\/- 0.6) than in TEA patients (4.3 +\/- 0.4) (p < 0.01). The average bed rest time was significantly shorter in the TEA group (16.9 +\/- 0.9 hours) (p < 0.01) than in the GA group (27.1 +\/- 4.1 hours). Overall satisfaction scores were significantly higher in the TEA group (4.4 +\/- 0.1) (p < 0.01) than in the GA group (3.5 +\/- 0.2). Side effects were observed at a higher frequency in the GA group (16\/32) (p < 0.0001) than in the TEA group (3\/32). The frequency of pethidine injection for pain relief was significantly lower in the TEA group (8\/32) (p < 0.0001) than in the GA group (24\/32). The total hospital cost (NT 64,392 +\/- 3,523 vs. NT 53,806 +\/- 2,817) (p = 0.0342) and anesthesia cost (NT 7,968 +\/- 246 vs. NT 5,268 +\/- 262) (p < 0.0001) are also significantly lower in the TEA group than the GA group. In conclusion, TEA provided better postoperative pain relief and recovery and lower cost than GA for MRM surgery.\n",

        "Abstract":"BACKGROUND: Orthopedic reductions are commonly performed procedures requiring sedation in the pediatric emergency department (PED). Ketamine is a widely used agent for pediatric procedural sedation, but its use may present difficulties in select populations, such as those with psychiatric diagnoses. In such a case, alternative agents that are safe and effective are needed. Etomidate is a commonly used induction agent for rapid-sequence intubation in the PED. Several retrospective and few prospective studies support etomidate's safety and efficacy in pediatric procedural sedation.\nOBJECTIVE: The objective was to compare etomidate\/fentanyl (E\/F) with ketamine\/midazolam (K\/M) for procedural sedation during orthopedic reductions in the PED.\nMETHODS: Prospective, partially blinded, randomized controlled study comparing intravenously administered K\/M with intravenously administered E\/F. A convenience sample of patients, aged 5 to 18 years, presenting to an urban PED with fracture requiring reduction was enrolled. Outcome measures included guardian and staff completion of visual analog scale and Likert scales for observed pain and satisfaction, blinded OSBD-r (Observational Scale of Behavioral Distress-Revised) scoring of digital recordings of reductions, and sedation and recovery times. Descriptive tracking of adverse effects, adverse events, and interventions were recorded at the sedation.\nRESULTS: Twenty-three patients were enrolled, 11 in the K\/M group and 12 in the E\/F group. The K\/M group had significantly lower mean OSBD-r scores compared with the E\/F group (0.08 vs 0.89, P = 0.001). Parents rated lower visual analog scale scores with K\/M than with E\/F (13.7 vs 50.5, P = 0.003) and favored K\/M on a 5-point satisfaction scale (P = 0.004). The E\/F group had significantly shorter total sedation times (49.6 vs 77.6 minutes, P = 0.003) and recovery times (24.7 vs 61.4 minutes, P = 0.000). There were no significant differences with respect to procedural amnesia and orthopedic practitioner satisfaction. Adverse effects noted in the K\/M group included dysphoric emergence reaction and vomiting. Vomiting, injection-site pain, myoclonus, airway readjustment, and supplemental oxygen use were observed in the E\/F group.\nCONCLUSIONS: This is a small study that strongly suggests that, for pediatric orthopedic reductions, K\/M is more effective at reducing observed distress than E\/F, although both provide equal procedural amnesia. With its significantly shorter sedation and recovery times, E\/F may be more applicable for procedural sedation for shorter, simpler procedures in the PED.\n",

        "Abstract":"The management of pain and anxiety in pediatric patients with burns includes the challenge of striking a balance between inadequate versus excessive medication. Ketamine provides effective sedative, analgesic, and amnestic properties for children and has been used intravenously with good results. With its recent availability as an elixir, we speculated that ketamine given orally may provide effective analgesia and sedation during wound care procedures with a wide safety margin. To test this hypothesis, 19 pediatric patients with burns undergoing a wound care procedure were randomized to receive either ketamine oral suspension or 300 mg acetaminophen with codeine phosphate and diphenhydramine, our prior standard for analgesia and sedation. Intensity of pain was determined with use of a color slide algometer and demonstrated more than 400% reduction in pain with the use of ketamine (p < 0.05). The Ramsey scale was used to quantitate sedation and demonstrated that ketamine improved sedation by 360% (p < 0.05). These results substantiate improved analgesia and sedation with oral ketamine as compared to a commonly used narcotic and sedative in facilitating wound care procedures in pediatric patients with burns. These findings suggest that expanded use of ketamine oral suspension may be.\n",

We designed a double-blind study to evaluate the effects of flumazenil on patient outcome when flumazenil was used to reverse large or small doses of midazolam as part of standardized monitored anesthesia care.\nMETHODS: Ninety-nine healthy consenting women undergoing breast biopsy procedures with local anesthesia were randomly assigned to one of four treatment groups: group 1, propofol-placebo (control); group 2, propofol-flumazenil; group 3, midazolam-placebo; or group 4, midazolam-flumazenil. All patients received intravenous midazolam 2 mg and intravenous fentanyl 50 micrograms, followed by an infusion of either propofol 25-150 micrograms.kg-1.min-1 or midazolam 0.5-4 micrograms.kg-1.min-1. At the end of the operation, patients were intravenously administered either 10 ml saline (groups 1 and 3) or flumazenil 1 mg in 10 ml saline (groups 2 and 4). Amnesia was assessed by determining recall of pictures shown before and after the procedure. Subjective feelings of sedation, anxiety, clumsiness, and fatigue were evaluated using 100-mm visual analogue scales preoperatively and at 30-min intervals in the recovery room. Cognitive function was assessed using the digit-symbol substitution test at similar intervals. Early recovery was evaluated by the ability of the patients to be transferred directly from the operating room to the step-down unit, as well as by times to ambulation and discharge. A standardized questionnaire and telephone interview were used to assess \"resedation\" and other postdischarge side effects.\nRESULTS: Flumazenil (1 mg) enhanced early recovery and picture recall after high-dose (group 4) but not low-dose (group 2) midazolam. Only 32% of patients in group 3 were transferred directly to the step-down unit compared with 85% in group 4 (P < 0.05). Flumazenil significantly improved visual analogue scale and digit-symbol substitution test scores at the 30- and 60-min testing intervals (P < 0.05). At the 90-min interval, there were no significant differences between groups 3 and 4. Compared with group 3 (84 +\/- 22 min), patients in groups 1, 2, and 4 were ready for discharge significantly earlier (60 +\/- 23, 65 +\/- 21, and 67 +\/- 27 min, respectively) (P < 0.05). However, 33% of the patients in group 4 reported resedation after discharge (vs. 0-8% in the other three study groups) (P < 0.05).\nCONCLUSIONS: Early recovery after breast biopsy procedures with midazolam sedation and flumazenil reversal is similar to recovery after propofol sedation. However, the beneficial effects of flumazenil were apparent only during the first 60 min after the procedure and resedation after discharge is an important consideration in the outpatient setting.\n",

An association between pain and depressive symptoms has been reported, but the impact of pain management on depression and other mood symptoms has not been investigated.\nOBJECTIVE: Secondary analyses of a cluster randomized clinical trial examine the response of dementia-related mood symptoms to a Stepwise Protocol of Treating Pain.\nMETHOD: Three-hundred fifty-two patients with moderate and severe dementia and significant behavioural disturbances, related to 60 clusters (i.e. clusters defined as single independent NH units) in 18 NHs of Western Norway, were included. All patients in the intervention group received individual daily pain treatment with paracetamol, extended release morphine, buprenorphine transdermal patch or pregabaline for 8 weeks, with additional follow-up assessment 4 weeks after completion of the intervention. Clusters randomized to control received usual treatment. A mood cluster consisting of depression, anxiety, sleep disorders, apathy and appetite items from the Neuropsychiatric Inventory-Nursing Home (NPI-NH) was the primary outcome.\nRESULTS: Analysed by Mann-Whitney U-tests, Stepwise Protocol of Treating Pain conferred significant benefit in treatment of the NPI-NH mood cluster (F = 13.4, df = 1;299, p < 0.001) and depression (F = 2.0, df = 1;301, p = 0.025). Further analyses highlighted improvements in apathy (F = 5.3, df = 1;300, p = 0.017), night-time behaviours (F = 3.1, df = 1;301, p = 0.050), and appetite items (F = 11.6, df = 1;301, p = 0.005), but not irritability (p = 0.092) and anxiety (p = 0.125).\nCONCLUSION: Mood symptoms including depression significantly improved with pain treatment, emphasizing the importance of more rigorous treatment of pain in agitated people with dementia. Findings have potentially immediate clinical relevance. Copyright © 2013 The Authors. International Journal of Geriatric Psychiatry published by John Wiley & Sons Ltd.\n",

        "Abstract":"The main criteria for assessing conscious sedation (perhaps now more correctly termed \"moderate sedation\/analgesia\") continue to be patient satisfaction and comfort, short duration, amnesia, and above all, patient safety. The problems reviewed last year - including the increasing pressure on endoscopy units to perform yet more procedures, reduce costs, and achieve shorter patient turn-around times - certainly have not gone away. Studies reviewed this year suggest that although many endoscopic procedures, such as oesophagogastroduodenoscopy (OGD), colonoscopy, and endoscopic ultrasonography (EUS) can indeed be performed without intravenous sedation, many patients still prefer to be sedated. Further papers on the possible role of ultrathin endoscopes in unsedated OGD are reviewed here. A study in Italy comparing virtual computed-tomographic (CT) colonography and conventional colonoscopy suggests that unsedated colonoscopy is unlikely to meet with wide acceptance. Audits of colonoscopy in both the United States and the United Kingdom suggest that there is still a long way to go before caecal intubation rates of more than 90 % are regularly attained. The evidence suggests that some endoscopists are using larger doses of a midazolam and pethidine combination than are generally recommended (particularly in elderly patients), and sedation-related deaths are still occurring. Impressively large clinical studies, particularly those from Switzerland, on the use of propofol administered by nonanaesthetists are leading to reconsideration of the earlier view that propofol should only be used by anaesthetists. If propofol is to be used more widely and become an agent administered by endoscopists (or nursing staff), then considerable improvements in the standard of airways management will be needed. Several new studies relating to bowel-cleansing agents and the use of a carbohydrate\/electrolyte \"cholera mixture\" to prevent the associated intravascular volume contraction have been published. Warm water is a cheap and effective way of reducing colonic spasm during colonoscopy, and intraluminal peppermint oil is a good antispasmodic in the stomach as well as the colon. Sedation should still be regarded as one part of an overall \"endoscopy package\". Finally, more attention needs to be given to patients' complaints regarding what are often considered by endoscopists to be \"trivial complications\" if the patients are to have a positive experience of their examination that will lead to them being prepared to come back a second time.

        "Abstract":"Cough is the most common complaint for which outpatients in the United States seek medical attention, and yet available therapeutic options for cough lack proven efficacy and are further limited by safety and abuse liabilities. Thus, safe and effective cough suppressants are needed. Recent preclinical studies described the antitussive effects of memantine, an N-methyl-d-aspartate receptor channel blocker used in the treatment of Alzheimer's disease. The goals of the present study were to compare the antitussive effects of memantine, dextromethorphan, and codeine in guinea pigs; to relate the dose-dependent actions of memantine in these studies to peak plasma concentrations achieved following oral administration; and to provide the first ever evaluation of the antitussive effect of memantine in humans. In guinea pigs, memantine and codeine were comparable in efficacy and potency but both were superior to dextromethorphan in the citric acid cough challenge model. The pharmacokinetic analyses suggest that memantine was active in guinea pigs at micromolar plasma concentrations. Subsequently, 14 healthy volunteers as well as 14 otherwise healthy adults with acute viral upper respiratory tract infection (URI) underwent capsaicin cough challenges 6 hours after ingestion of 20 mg memantine and matched placebo in a randomized, double-blind, crossover fashion. In healthy volunteers, memantine significantly inhibited cough reflex sensitivity (P = 0.034). In subjects with URI, responsiveness to capsaicin was markedly increased, and in these patients, the inhibition of cough reflex sensitivity by memantine relative to placebo did not reach statistical significance (P = 0.088). These data support further research to investigate the potential of memantine as a clinically useful antitussive.

        "Abstract":"OBJECTIVES: Behavioral disturbances and pain are common in nursing home (NH) patients with dementia. An association between pain and increased agitation has been suggested, and recently a significant reduction of agitation has been demonstrated by pain treatment in patients with moderate to severe dementia. We now examined which specific agitated behaviors respond to individualized pain treatment.\nDESIGN: Cluster randomized clinical trial.\nSETTING: 60 clusters (i.e., clusters defined as single independent NH units) in 18 NHs within five municipalities of Western Norway.\nPARTICIPANTS: 352 patients with moderate to severe dementia and clinically significant behavioral disturbances.\nINTERVENTION: The control group received usual treatment and care. According to a predefined scheme for 8 weeks, all patients in the intervention group received individual daily pain treatment with acetaminophen, extended release morphine, buprenorphine transdermal patch, and\/or pregabaline.\nMEASUREMENTS: Cohen-Mansfield Agitation Inventory subscales and items.\nRESULTS: Analyses demonstrated that Factor 3 (Verbally agitated behaviors) showed the largest significant difference (DF = 1204.0, t = -4.308, p <0.001), followed by Factor 2 (Physically non-aggressive behaviors) (DF = 1198.0, t = -2.672, p = 0.008), and Factor 1 (Aggressive behaviors) (DF = 1196.0, t = -2.093, p = 0.037) after 8 weeks, by a linear random intercept mixed model in two-way repeated-measures configuration with adjustment for heteroscedasticity.\nCONCLUSION: We found that verbal agitation behaviors such as complaining, negativism, repetitious sentences and questions, constant request for attention, and cursing or verbal aggression responded to pain treatment. In addition, restlessness and pacing were sensible to analgesics. Such behaviors should therefore lead to an assessment of pain, and pain treatment. Further studies comparing how pain treatment should be balanced against other strategies including psychotropic drugs are needed. Copyright © 2014 American Association for Geriatric Psychiatry.

Patients were divided into Group One (received sedative\/amnesic diazepam), and Group Two, (received amnesic\/sedative, midazolam and analgesic fentanyl).\nRESULTS: All enteroclyses were successfully completed; there were no hospital admissions due to complications. In Group One (n=106), mean dose of diazepam was 12.7 mg. 25% had oxygen desaturation (n=25), and post-procedure vomiting without aspiration (n=1). 56% of outpatients completed phone surveys, and 68% recalled procedural discomfort. In Group Two (n=45), mean doses were 3.9 mg midazolam and 108 mcg fentanyl. 31% had desaturation (n=13), and post-procedure vomiting without aspiration (n=1). 87% had only a vague recall of the procedure or of any discomfort.\nCONCLUSION: A combination of amnesic and fentanyl prevented the recall of discomfort of nasoenteric intubation and infusion in most patients who had enteroclysis compared to diazepam.

        "Abstract":"PURPOSE: In oral and maxillofacial outpatient surgery, sedation techniques are an important component in patient management for a wide variety of surgical procedures. Fentanyl and midazolam are commonly used sedatives with different mechanisms of action and specific analgesic or amnestic properties. This study examined whether the order of their administration would affect a patient's pain perception or procedural vital signs.\nMATERIALS AND METHODS: After institutional review board approval and written informed consent, a prospective, randomized, parallel-group clinical trial was conducted in patients who planned to undergo removal of at least 2 third molars under intravenous moderate sedation. Patients were randomly assigned to 1 of 2 groups. The fentanyl-first group received fentanyl and then midazolam; the midazolam-first group received midazolam and then fentanyl. Recollection of the intraoperative pain score was assessed 24 hours after surgery using the Wong-Baker FACES pain scale. The Mann-Whitney U test was used to assess for the presence of a statistically significant difference between the 2 groups. Statistically significant differences in procedural vital sign fluctuations were examined using the t test. Patients' satisfaction with the procedure was assessed and intergroup comparisons were made.\nRESULTS: Sixty-six patients were enrolled, 1 of whom did not complete the study. Recollected procedural pain scores at 24 hours after surgery were not statistically different between groups. Median scores on the Wong-Baker FACES pain scale for the 2 groups were 2.0 (interquartile range, 3.1) for the fentanyl-first group and 1.5 (interquartile range, 2.5) for the midazolam-first group (P = .333). There was no statistical difference in the change in vital signs from baseline to 2 surgical end points in the 2 groups. In addition, patient satisfaction with the procedure did not statistically differ between the 2 groups.\nCONCLUSIONS: In this study, selective sequencing of midazolam or fentanyl during an intravenous moderate-sedation procedure did not result in a measurable difference of recollected procedural pain scores at 24 hours after third molar extraction. The choice of the sedation agents and the order of their administration should be tailored to the patient's needs, type of surgical procedure, and surgeon preference.

        "Abstract":"The side-effects of two opioid agonist-antagonists, nalbuphine and pentazocine, were assessed when used for patient-controlled postoperative analgesia. Forty ASA I or II patients scheduled for upper abdominal surgery were randomly allocated to two equal groups. The anaesthetic technique was the same for all the patients: premedication with atropine and diazepam, induction with thiopentone and suxamethonium and maintenance with fentanyl, pancuronium, nitrous oxide and halothane. Patient-controlled computer assisted analgesia (On-Demand Analgesia Computer) was started in the recovery room at least 2 h after the last administration of fentanyl. The parameters used were: a routine hourly dose (the half of that received during the previous hour), with on demand delivery of nalbuphine (15 micrograms.kg-1) or pentazocine (45 micrograms.kg-1) aliquots respectively, with a refractory period between two demands of 4 min and a total hourly maximum dose of 16 mg and 48 mg respectively. The following parameters were measured before the start of self-administration, and every hour afterwards for 24 h: systolic (Pasys) and diastolic blood pressures, heart rate, pressure-rate product (PRP), respiratory rate, end-tidal CO2 and pain (by way of a three point scale). Analgesia was assessed on a four-point scale every 6 h. The total doses of nalbuphine and pentazocine administered were 94 +\/- 43 mg and 251 +\/- 150 mg respectively. The only parameters significantly different between the two groups were Pasys and PRP, being higher in the pentazocine group. There were no significant differences in the side-effects (drowsiness, nausea, vomiting, headache, amnesia, logorrhoea and urine retention). All patients in both groups were satisfied with this technique.(ABSTRACT TRUNCATED AT 250 WORDS)\n",

        "Abstract":"The potential of placebo treatments to alleviate a variety of medical conditions has long been recognised. Although the placebo effect is widely known, the physiological mechanisms underlying this phenomenon are not well understood. This review focuses on the existing evidence for placebo responses in different neurological conditions, including pain, Parkinson's disease, depression, sleep and immune-mediated disorders. Special attention is paid to the neural changes associated with placebo treatments, as revealed by in vivo neurophysiological and functional neuroimaging studies. Converging evidence suggests that placebo analgesia is linked to the activation of the endogenous opioid analgesia network, whilst dopaminergic pathways seem to play a central role in the placebo effect in movement disorders and neuroimmunomodulation. Further research on the placebo response is needed, both to improve the efficacy of its application in clinical practice and to shed more light on the complexity of mind-body interactions.

        "Abstract":"The differential effects of drugs used for intravenous pre-medication are reviewed using the results of controlled clinical trials in dental outpatients. The evaluation of clinical success requires experimental control of factors which can confound both the therapeutic and evaluation processes. The evaluation of drugs which are given primarily to alleviate anxiety requires that this effect be assessed by the patient's self-report rather than by the clinician's estimate of drug effect based on external manifestations. The results of the studies reviewed suggest that intravenous diazepam accomplishes the therapeutic objectives of anxiety relief, decreased pain perception, and amnesia. The addition of a narcotic, while reducing the diazepam dose, does not result in any greater effect, but does improve patient cooperation. It is concluded that diazepam, administered to clinical end-point, accomplishes most of the goals of intravenous pre-medication with minimal potential for adverse effects. The use of additional agents may improve patient cooperation, but this possible advantage must be weighed against the potential for increased systemic effects.\n",

        "Abstract":"Postoperative performance following total intravenous anaesthesia (TIVA) using midazolam and alfentanil was studied with and without the administration of a single dose of a benzodiazepine antagonist, flumazenil (Ro 15-1788). Performance was compared with a reference group anaesthetized with thiopentone, alfentanil and nitrous oxide. All patients were assessed by use of a rating scale which took into account the degree of sedation, amnesia, comprehension and cooperation as well as temporal and spatial orientation. There was a slow recovery following TIVA with somnolence and amnesia lasting several hours. Administration of flumazenil 1.0 mg i.v. at extubation caused a significant reduction of sedation (P less than 0.001) during the first postoperative hour, with patients fully awake or only lightly sedated, but was later followed by resedation. The patients of the reference group were moderately sedated during the observation period. Five and six hours postoperatively there was no difference between the groups. Amnesia was more profound in the groups that received midazolam; the effect of the antagonist could only be seen for 15 min after its administration. Comprehension and cooperation, as well as orientation, were equally good in the antagonist and in the reference group during the immediate postoperative period, whereas in the TIVA group a gradual improvement over the first hours was seen. In the antagonist group there was no increase in the number of analgesic requirements, no anxiety attacks or other adverse effects. It is concluded that flumazenil offers an improvement in postoperative performance following TIVA induced by midazolam and alfentanil, but the effects are of short duration.\n",

At the present time there are limited pharmacological options for relieving agitation and little is known about the safety and efficacy of opioid drugs in this setting.\nOBJECTIVES: To determine the clinical efficacy and safety of opioids for agitation in people with dementia.\nSEARCH METHODS: We searched ALOIS, the Cochrane Dementia and Cognitive Improvement Group Specialized Register, on 13 June 2014 using the terms: narcotic OR opioid OR opium OR morphine OR buprenorphine OR codeine OR dextromoramide OR diphenoxylate OR dipipanone OR dextropropoxyphene OR propoxyphene OR diamorphine OR dihydrocodeine OR alfentanil OR fentanyl OR remifentanil OR meptazinol OR methadone OR nalbuphine OR oxycodone OR papaveretum OR pentazocine OR meperidine OR pethidine OR phenazocine OR hydrocodone OR hydromorphone OR levorphanol OR oxymorphone OR butorphanol OR dezocine OR sufentanil OR ketobemidone.ALOIS contains records of clinical trials identified from monthly searches of a number of major healthcare databases such as MEDLINE, EMBASE and PscyINFO, as well as numerous trial registries and grey literature sources.\nSELECTION CRITERIA: Randomised, controlled trials of opioids compared to placebo for agitation in people with dementia.\nDATA COLLECTION AND ANALYSIS: Two authors independently assessed the studies identified by the search against the inclusion criteria.\nMAIN RESULTS: There are currently no completed randomised, placebo controlled trials of opioids for agitation in dementia.

To avoid the side-effects of opioids a drug that can replace opioids is most welcome. Midazolam not only has no side-effects but also has the advantages of sedation and amnesia. In a prospective randomised clinical study ASA class 1 or 2 patients undergoing upper abdominal surgeries were studied to compare the analgesic and sedative effect of continuous thoracic epidural infusion of bupivacaine versus continuous thoracic epidural administration of bupivacaine with midazolam postoperatively. They were divided into 2 groups. Via thoracic epidural route patients in group A (n = 24) were given 60 ml of 0.25% bupivacaine while those in group B (n = 25) were given 58 ml of 0.25% bupivacaine + midazolam 2 ml (10 mg). Each patient was infused using a syringe pump at the rate of 5 ml\/hour. Variables studied postoperatively were pulse, BP, RR, SpO2, analgesia score and sedation score. Statistically significant differences in pulse, BP, RR and SpO2 were not seen. Better sedation, analgesia scores and amnesia were noted in patients belonging to group B as compared to patients of group A. This combination may thus replace routinely used combinations of opioids and local anaesthetics.\n",

        "Abstract":"BACKGROUND: The procedure of placing a catheter for continuous regional anaesthesia is often associated with fear and pain in the patient. Thus, we evaluated the use of midazolam and fentanyl to improve patient's comfort and cooperation.\nMETHODS: After an oral dose of 20 mg clorazepate, 174 patients receiving peripheral nerve catheters for regional anaesthesia where randomized into 3 groups to receive either intravenous placebo, 3 mg midazolam or 0.1 mg fentanyl immediately before catheter placement in a double-blind manner. Stepwise regression analysis was used to identify factors associated with patient's assessment of subjective discomfort (measured using a VAS 0-10) during the procedure. Amnesia was evaluated 24 h later. The anaesthetist rated patient's cooperation during catheter placement.\nRESULTS: Female sex and longer duration of catheter placement had significant negative impact on patient's comfort, whereas fentanyl showed an improvement. Age, body mass index, midazolam and the type of catheter had no influence. The following day 27% of the midazolam group, 6% of the placebo group and 9% of the fentanyl patients did not remember catheter placement. Patient's cooperation was poor in 26% of the midazolam patients but only in 9% of the placebo and 3% of the patients receiving fentanyl. Of the placebo patients 18.4% had to be supplemented with fentanyl because they found the procedure of catheter placement unbearable. No side effects occurred in either group.\nCONCLUSION: As patient's comfort and cooperation were significantly improved by fentanyl, we recommend fentanyl to facilitate catheter placement for regional anaesthesia.\n",

        "Title":"Does propofol have advantages over midazolam and isoflurane? Comparative study of 2 total intravenous anesthesia techniques using midazolam and propofol, versus balanced anesthesia with isoflurane",
        "Abstract":"OBJECTIVES: To compare two techniques for total intravenous anesthesia (TIVA): midazolam-alfentanil-flumazenil and propofol-alfentanil, contrasting them with combined anesthesia (thiopental-isoflurane-alfentanil) and assessing the efficacy of flumazenil in continuous perfusion for preventing resedation in TIVA with midazolam.\nPATIENTS AND METHODS: The efficacy and clinical tolerance of the 3 anesthetic techniques with propofol, midazolam or isoflurane were studied in 63 patients undergoing elective breast, lumbar or gynecological surgery. Anesthetic induction was achieved with midazolam 0.3 mg\/kg-1 (group M), propofol 2.5 mg\/kg-1 (group P) or thiopental 3 mg\/kg-1 (group I); all patients also received 50 micrograms\/kg-1 alfentanil and vecuronium bromide 0.12 mg\/kg-1\/h-1. Maintenance was achieved with midazolam in perfusion at 0.12 mg\/kg-1\/h-1 (group M); propofol in perfusion at 7 mg\/kg-1\/h-1 and a pre-incision dose of 1.5 mg\/kg-1 (group P); and isoflurane at 1.15% (group I). The 3 groups also received one pre-incision dose of alfentanil 25 micrograms\/kg-1 and post-incision perfusion at 60 micrograms\/kg-1\/h-1. The infusion of alfentanil was changed by amounts of 20 micrograms\/kg-1\/h-1 in accordance with the patient's response to surgery. After surgery patients in group M received flumazenil 0.5 mg i.v. over 30 sec and a perfusion of flumazenil 0.5 mg over 60 min. Parameters indicating efficacy were: 1) total dose and timing of alfentanil; 2) number of instances of inadequate anesthesia; 3) peri-operative amnesia; 4) times of awakening and extubation after surgery, and 5) the number of patients in each group who required naloxone. Parameters indicating tolerance were: 1) hemodynamic variables; 2) the number of postoperative desaturations; 3) level of sedation, comprehension and motor coordination and orientation; 4) the \"G\/g detection\" test and the memory recall test; 5) adverse side effects; 6) need for postoperative analgesia, and 7) evaluation of the anesthetic technique.\nRESULTS: The 3 techniques afforded effective control of hemodynamic response to intubation and surgical incision. Anesthetic maintenance was easy and safe with isoflurane and propofol. Higher doses of alfentanil, however, were needed with midazolam and we found a higher incidence of signs of superficial anesthesia. Reversion of midazolam with flumazenil 0.5 mg i.v. produced earlier awakening, although this was followed later by relapse into hypno-sedation that could not be prevented with a perfusion of flumazenil. Although recovery from anesthesia was slower with propofol than with isoflurane, we observed no differences in level of sedation, motor coordination and postoperative comprehension. Maintenance with isoflurane produced a higher incidence of adverse side effects such as tremors and nausea after surgery.\nCONCLUSIONS: None of the TIVA techniques proved superior in all the parameters studied during anesthetic maintenance when compared with balanced isoflurane-alfentanil, although the propofol-alfentanil combination was found to be superior to that of midazolam-alfentanil. After anesthesia, however, recovery was better with the association of propofol-alfentanil and adverse side effects were fewer. Flumazenil at the doses used was ineffective for preventing resedation due to midazolam.\n",

        "Title":"Emerging options with coxib therapy",
        "Abstract":"Future clinical applications of cyclooxygenase (COX)-2-selective inhibitors (coxibs) are likely to extend beyond their current use as oral analgesics in high-risk arthritis patients. The clinical utility of coxibs for the treatment of Alzheimer's disease (AD) is under investigation. Epidemiological surveys, preclinical studies, and preliminary clinical trials with nonsteroidal anti-inflammatory drugs (NSAIDs) have suggested that inflammatory mechanisms play a role in the neurodegeneration of AD. Clinical trials are currently being conducted to determine the effect of coxibs on the rate of AD progression. The use of coxibs as chemopreventive agents in colorectal cancer (CRC) is also under investigation. The chemopreventive benefits of coxibs to promote cell death (apoptosis) and inhibit angiogenesis in CRC have been shown in tumor cell lines and in animal and human models. In addition, palliative care clinicians and oncologists are increasingly including coxibs in their management of cancer pain. Coxibs are utilized for their opioid-sparing effect in the management of cancer pain, without impairing wound healing, or promoting bleeding diathesis (antiplatelet effects) or adverse gastrointestinal effects in patients receiving chemotherapy or radiation treatment.
