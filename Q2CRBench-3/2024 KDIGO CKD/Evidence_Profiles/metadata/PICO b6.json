    "Question": "What are the effects of non–vitamin K antagonist oral anticoagulants (NOACs) (also known as direct-acting oral anticoagulants [DOACs]) with or without warfarin compared with placebo or warfarin alone among people with CKD and atrial fibrillation in terms of stroke and bleeding risks?",

    "Explanations": {
        "a": "The total number of events among the 6083 participants of the 4 trials was estimated to be less than the number needed to reach the optimal information size (i.e., 300). One study did not report the number of events (Hori 2013).",
        "b": "Only some of the 7 studies reported on outcome.",
        "c": "The total number of events among the participants of the 5 trials was estimated to be less than the number needed to reach the optimal information size (i.e., 300). The number of events and the number of participants were not always reported."
