        "Published":"2016 Jan",
        "Abstract":"OBJECTIVE: Biological disease-modifying antirheumatic drugs (DMARDs) that inhibit aberrant immune reactions in rheumatoid arthritis (RA) cannot induce complete remission in all patients. Combination therapies using two biological DMARDs have failed to exert additive effects and increased serious infections. We have found that cell cycle inhibition of synovial fibroblasts with cyclin-dependent kinase (CDK) inhibitors ameliorated the disease in animal models of RA without attenuating acquired immunity. The objective of this study was to determine whether a clinically well-tolerated selective CDK 4\/6 inhibitor (CDKI), palbociclib, is effective and whether combination with cytokine blockers acts additively without enhancing immune suppression. METHODS: The effects of CDKI on haematopoiesis and physical and behavioural findings in mice were evaluated. Mice with collagen-induced arthritis (CIA) were treated with CDKI, etanercept or anti-interleukin (IL)-6 receptor antibody (MR16-1) alone or with a combination of CDKI with etanercept or MR16-1. Their clinical, histological and radiographic scores, serum anti-(type II collagen (CII)) antibody levels and proliferative responses of lymph node cells to CII were determined. RESULTS: Although CDKI induced marginal myelosuppression, it was well tolerated and ameliorated CIA dose-dependently. The combinations of low-dose CDKI and either tumour necrosis factor-alpha or IL-6 blocker enhanced the antiarthritic effects additively. The addition of CDKI to either cytokine blocker did not affect the levels of anti-CII antibodies and proliferative responses of lymphocytes to CII. CONCLUSIONS: A clinically well-tolerated CDK4\/6 inhibitor exerted antiarthritic effects in this mouse model. By combining therapeutic agents targeting immune reaction and synovial proliferation, we have demonstrated for the first time that two molecular targeting treatments act additively and may not increase immune suppression.

        "Abstract":"Granulomatous autoinflammatory diseases are monogenic syndromes caused by mutations in the region encoding for the nucleotide-binding domain region of the NOD2\/CARD15 gene with subsequent dysregulation of the inflammatory response and formation of noncaseous granulomas. They include Blau syndrome (BS) and early-onset sarcoidosis (EOS); both are clinically and genetically indistinguishable between them and they are the familial (autosomal dominantly inherited) and sporadic forms of the same disease, respectively. We describe a case of EOS, misdiagnosed for 30 years such as \"juvenile rheumatoid arthritis\" before and \"classic sarcoidosis\" later. In our patient, we found a new de novo mutation (E383G) in NOD2 that has been reported only in a family of Japanese patients with BS. After long-term follow-up (42 months), infliximab maintained good efficacy and safety without any sign of disease relapse and side effects.",

        "Published":"2017 Mar",
        "Abstract":"OBJECTIVES: This prospective study aimed to compare synovial ultrasound scores to conventional measures (DAS28, CRP levels) in predicting radiographic progression in patients with rheumatoid arthritis under TNF antagonist therapy. METHODS: Patients with RA who received TNF antagonist therapy were enrolled, all of whom underwent clinical, laboratory, and ultrasonographic assessments with grayscale and power Doppler assessments of bilateral elbows (anterior and posterior recess), wrists (dorsal, palmar, and ulnar aspects), second and third MCP joints (dorsal and palmar recess), and PIP II and III (dorsal and palmar) at baseline and at 1, 3 months. Hand radiographic damage was evaluated using van der Heijde modified Total Sharp Score (TSS) at baseline and 12 months. RESULTS: Thirty-two patients (384 joints, 832 synovial sites) continued the same treatment regimen for 12 months and completed the study, 41.6% of whom showed radiographic progression during the study period. Baseline DAS28 (P = 0.123), CRP level (P = 0.177), grayscale synovitis (P = 0.092), and power Doppler synovitis (P = 0.120) could not predict radiological damage in the TNF antagonist therapy group. However, DELTATSS was significantly related to changes in grayscale synovitis between baseline and 1 month (P = 0.011), but not at 3 months (P = 0.591), and was not related to changes in the power Doppler score at 1 (P = 0.634) and 3 months (P = 0.298). CONCLUSIONS: Our data confirm that delayed improvement in grayscale synovitis between baseline and 1 month more accurately reflects 1-year radiological damage than conventional measures such as DAS28 score and CRP level. Therefore, we recommend serial ultrasound follow-up of patients with RA receiving TNF antagonist therapy.",

        "Abstract":"OBJECTIVE: To determine the relationship between hydroxychloroquine concentration and effect in patients with rheumatoid arthritis (RA). METHODS: Using a cross sectional study design, drug concentration and effect were measured at one time. Forty-three patients with RA, receiving hydroxychloroquine therapy for at least 6 months and not receiving glucocorticosteroids, gold or penicillamine therapy were enrolled. The main outcome measures were hydroxychloroquine concentration and disease activity measured as degree of synovitis, pain, duration and intensity of morning stiffness, impairment of activities of daily living, patients' and physicians' subjective assessment of disease, erythrocyte sedimentation rate, and rheumatoid factor (RF). Hemoglobin and albumin concentrations were also recorded. RESULTS: Patients with none or mild intensity of morning stiffness, those with stiffness lasting less than 0.5 h and those with negative RF had significantly higher hydroxychloroquine blood concentrations than those in whom these measures indicated a more active disease (Mann-Whitney U test, p < 0.05). Similar trends were recorded for 3 other disease activity measures (p = 0.12-0.24). Analysis of all 9 individual disease activity measures indicated that the groups with less active disease had higher mean blood concentrations of hydroxychloroquine than those with measures indicating more active disease (p < 0.01). CONCLUSION: Our data provide the first evidence of a concentration-response relationship for hydroxychloroquine in RA for individual disease activity measures. However, an unweighted summed score of disease activity did not correlate significantly with drug blood concentrations. A prospective study is necessary to confirm the relationship and to determine a therapeutic concentration range.",

        "Published":"2018 12",
        "Abstract":"BACKGROUND AND PURPOSE: In patients with rheumatoid arthritis (RA), the serum C-reactive protein (CRP) level is associated with ischaemic cerebrovascular disease (iCVD). Acute iCVD patients with RA were investigated, assessing changes of clinical characteristics and CRP with progress in RA treatment. METHODS: Patients hospitalized for acute iCVD from August 2002 to February 2018 were divided into two groups at February 2010. Patients with RA were retrospectively identified. The incidence of RA, the occurrence of acute exacerbation of inflammation due to causes other than synovitis preceding iCVD (non-synovitis AEI) and serum CRP were compared. RESULTS: In the first and second periods, 23\/1203 patients (1.9%) and 22\/1094 patients (2.0%) respectively had acute iCVD with RA. Non-synovitis AEI was significantly less frequent in the second period (5%, n = 1) than in the first period (35%, n = 8) (P < 0.05). CRP was significantly lower at iCVD onset in the second period [median and interquartile range 2.72 (0.89-4.5) mg\/dl vs. 0.34 (0.12-1.19) mg\/dl, P < 0.01]. Excluding nine patients with non-synovitis AEI, CRP was still lower in the second period [1.21 (0.47-2.72) mg\/dl vs. 0.33 (0.11-0.98) mg\/dl, P < 0.01]. CRP levels before both iCVD and non-synovitis AEI tended to be lower in the second period [1.53 (0.3-2.78) mg\/dl vs. 0.69 (0.06-1.28) mg\/dl, P = 0.059]. Two patients using tocilizumab developed iCVD despite persistently low CRP levels. CONCLUSIONS: With progress in treatment, RA-related inflammation was better suppressed and CRP decreased, but the prevalence of RA amongst acute iCVD patients was unchanged. Strategies for tighter control of inflammation are needed, and a new biomarker may be required in patients using tocilizumab. Copyright © 2018 EAN.",

        "Abstract":"The aim of the study was to investigate the predictive value of different reduced joint ultrasound (US) assessments of synovitis and tenosynovitis in relation to unstable remission in a cohort of rheumatoid arthritis (RA) patients on methotrexate therapy. Forty-seven RA patients (38 women, 9 men), being treated with methotrexate (MTX), in clinical remission as judged by their consultant rheumatologist were evaluated for disease activity according to the Disease Activity Score (DAS) 28 at baseline and 6 months. Sustained remission and unstable remission were defined according to the baseline and 6-month DAS28 and changes in RA therapy during the follow-up. Each patient underwent at baseline a B-mode and power Doppler (PD) assessment of 44 joints and 20 tendons\/tendon compartments by a rheumatologist blinded to the clinical and laboratory data. B-mode synovial hypertrophy (SH), synovial PD signal, B-mode tenosynovitis, and Doppler tenosynovitis were scored 0-3. The presence and index of synovial PD signal in 44 joints [odds ratio (OR) 8.21 (p = 0.016) and OR 2.20 (p = 0.049), respectively] and in 12 joints [OR 5.82 (p = 0.041) and OR 4.19 (p = 0.020), respectively], the presence of SH in wrist and MCP joints [OR 4.79 (p = 0.045)], and the presence of synovial PD signal in wrist-MCP-ankle-MTP joints [OR 4.62 (p = 0.046)] were predictors of unstable remission. The 12-joint or wrist-hand-ankle-MTP US assessments can predict unstable remission in RA patients in apparent clinical remission being treated with MTX.",

        "Published":"2004 Jun 19",
        "Abstract":"BACKGROUND: Rheumatoid arthritis is characterised by inflammatory synovitis, articular destruction, and accelerated atherogenesis. HMG-CoA (3-hydroxy-3-methylglutarylcoenzyme A) reductase inhibitors (statins) mediate clinically significant vascular risk reduction in patients without inflammatory disease and might have immunomodulatory function. We postulated that statins might reduce inflammatory factors in rheumatoid arthritis and modify surrogates for vascular risk. METHODS: 116 patients with rheumatoid arthritis were randomised in a double-blind placebo-controlled trial to receive 40 mg atorvastatin or placebo as an adjunct to existing disease-modifying antirheumatic drug therapy. Patients were followed up over 6 months and disease activity variables and circulating vascular risk factors were measured. Coprimary outcomes were change in disease activity score (DAS28) and proportion meeting EULAR (European League Against Rheumatism) response criteria. Analysis was by intention to treat. FINDINGS: At 6 months, DAS28 improved significantly on atorvastatin (-0.5, 95% CI -0.75 to -0.25) compared with placebo (0.03, -0.23 to 0.28; difference between groups -0.52, 95% CI -0.87 to -0.17, p=0.004). DAS28 EULAR response was achieved in 18 of 58 (31%) patients allocated atorvastatin compared with six of 58 (10%) allocated placebo (odds ratio 3.9, 95% CI 1.42-10.72, p=0.006). C-reactive protein and erythrocyte sedimentation rate declined by 50% and 28%, respectively, relative to placebo (p<0.0001, p=0.005, respectively). Swollen joint count also fell (-2.69 vs -0.53; mean difference -2.16, 95% CI -3.67 to -0.64, p=0.0058). Adverse events occurred with similar frequency in patients allocated atorvastatin and placebo. INTERPRETATION: These data show that statins can mediate modest but clinically apparent anti-inflammatory effects with modification of vascular risk factors in the context of high-grade autoimmune inflammation.",

        "Abstract":"AIM: To monitor joint inflammation and destruction in rheumatoid arthritis (RA) patients receiving adalimumab\/methotrexate combination therapy using MRI and ultrasonography. To assess the predictive value of MRI and ultrasonography for erosive progression on CT and compare MRI\/ultrasonography\/radiography for erosion detection\/monitoring. METHODS: Fifty-two erosive biological-naive RA patients were followed with repeated MRI\/ultrasonography\/radiography (0\/6\/12 months) and clinical\/biochemical assessments during adalimumab\/methotrexate combination therapy. RESULTS: No overall erosion progression or repair was observed at 6 or 12 months (Wilcoxon; p > 0.05), but erosion progressors and regressors were observed using the smallest detectable change cut-off. Scores of MRI synovitis, grey-scale synovitis (GSS) and power Doppler ultrasonography decreased after 6 and 12 months (p < 0.05), as did DAS28, HAQ and tender and swollen joint counts (p < 0.001). Patients with progression on CT had higher baseline MRI bone oedema scores. The RR for CT progression in bones with versus without baseline MRI bone oedema was 3.8 (95% CI 1.5 to 9.3) and time-integrated MRI bone oedema, power Doppler and GSS scores were higher in bones\/joints with CT progression (Mann-Whitney; p < 0.05). With CT as the reference method, sensitivities\/specificities for erosion in metacarpophalangeal joints were 68%\/92%, 44%\/95% and 26%\/98% for MRI, ultrasonography and radiography, respectively. Median intraobserver correlation coefficient was 0.95 (range 0.44-0.99). CONCLUSION: During adalimumab\/methotrexate combination therapy, no overall erosive progression or repair occurred, whereas repair of individual erosions was documented on MRI, and MRI and ultrasonography synovitis decreased. Inflammation on MRI and ultrasonography, especially MRI bone oedema, was predictive for erosive progression on CT, at bone\/joint level and MRI bone oedema also at patient level.",

        "Abstract":"BACKGROUND: In the present study, we explored the effects of immediate induction therapy with the anti-tumour necrosis factor (TNF)alpha antibody infliximab (IFX) plus methotrexate (MTX) compared with MTX alone and with placebo (PL) in patients with very early inflammatory arthritis. METHODS: In an investigator-initiated, double-blind, randomised, placebo-controlled, multi-centre trial (ISRCTN21272423, http:\/\/www.isrctn.com\/ISRCTN21272423 ), patients with synovitis of 12 weeks duration in at least two joints underwent 1 year of treatment with IFX in combination with MTX, MTX monotherapy, or PL randomised in a 2:2:1 ratio. The primary endpoint was clinical remission after 1 year (sustained for at least two consecutive visits 8 weeks apart) with remission defined as no swollen joints, 0-2 tender joints, and an acute-phase reactant within the normal range. RESULTS: Ninety patients participated in the present study. At week 54 (primary endpoint), 32% of the patients in the IFX + MTX group achieved sustained remission compared with 14% on MTX alone and 0% on PL. This difference (p < 0.05 over all three groups) was statistically significant for IFX + MTX vs PL (p < 0.05), but not for IFX + MTX vs MTX (p = 0.10), nor for MTX vs PL (p = 0.31). Remission was maintained during the second year on no therapy in 75% of the IFX + MTX patients compared with 20% of the MTX-only patients. CONCLUSIONS: These results indicate that patients with early arthritis can benefit from induction therapy with anti-TNF plus MTX compared with MTX alone, suggesting that intensive treatment can alter the disease evolution.

        "Abstract":"OBJECTIVE: To investigate the role of matrix metalloproteinases (MMPs) and tissue inhibitors of matrix metalloproteinases (TIMPs) in spondylarthropathy (SpA) synovitis. METHODS: Paired samples of synovial biopsy tissue as well as serum and synovial fluid (SF) from 41 patients with SpA and 20 patients with rheumatoid arthritis (RA) and serum samples from 20 healthy controls were analyzed by immunohistochemistry and enzyme-linked immunosorbent assay for the presence of MMPs 1, 2, 3, and 9 and TIMPs 1 and 2. In addition, sera from 16 patients with ankylosing spondylitis (AS) and peripheral synovitis and 17 patients with AS and exclusively axial involvement were analyzed. An additional cohort of SpA patients was analyzed at baseline and after 12 weeks of infliximab treatment. RESULTS: Staining for MMPs and TIMPs showed a cellular and interstitial pattern in the synovial lining and sublining layers that was similar between the RA and SpA patients. Involvement of MMPs and TIMPs in SpA synovitis was suggested by the correlation with cellular infiltration, vascularization, and cartilage degradation. Higher serum levels of MMPs 3 and 9 were revealed in SpA and RA patients as compared with healthy controls. Production of MMP-3, but not MMP-9, in the serum reflected the presence of peripheral synovitis, as indicated by 1) the correlation between serum levels, SF levels (which were 1,000-fold higher than the serum levels), and synovial expression of MMP-3, 2) the increased levels of MMP-3 in AS patients with peripheral disease and not exclusively axial involvement, and 3) the correlation of serum and SF MMP-3 with parameters of synovial, but not systemic, inflammation. The modulation of the MMP\/TIMP system by tumor necrosis factor alpha (TNFalpha) blockade was confirmed by the down-regulation of all MMPs and TIMPs in the synovium and a pronounced and rapid decrease of serum MMP-3. CONCLUSION: MMPs and TIMPs are highly expressed in SpA synovitis and mirror both the inflammatory and tissue-remodeling aspects of the local disease process. Serum MMP-3, originating from the inflamed joint, represents a valuable biomarker for peripheral synovitis. Modulation of the MMP\/TIMP system by infliximab could contribute to the antiinflammatory and tissue-remodeling effects of TNFalpha blockade in SpA.",

        "Abstract":"To evaluate the clinical remission by means of power Doppler ultrasonographic (PDUS) monitoring in a group of patients with rheumatoid arthritis (RA) in clinical remission (DAS28 < 2.6). The study included 54 patients with RA in therapy with DMARDS, anti-TNF, or no therapy in clinical remission according to ACR criteria and DAS 28 < 2.6 for at least 6 months. All patients had active wrist or hand inflammation in the past. US examination evaluated the presence of active synovitis, power Doppler signal, and synovial hypertrophy on the following bilateral joints: metacarpophalangeal-proximal interphalangeal joints-flexor tendons (on 2degree-3degree fingers) and wrist (radiocarpal and midcarpal joints). In 19 patients, there was an agreement between clinical and US parameters. However, 35 patients with clinical remission showed a positive ultrasonographic assessment and at least an active parameter. No statistic correlation was found between US examination and antibody assessment (anti-CCP and\/or RF). Patients in therapy with anti-TNF or other therapies showed similar US assessment without significant statistical differences. Among eleven patients that presented swollen and tender joints at the latest physical examination, which preceded US exam, just 5 patients had an US confirmation too. In the other patients, the PDUS did not confirm the presence of inflammation in the corresponding swollen and tender joints or showed a positive ultrasonographic assessment in other locations. The remission state is a great therapy target and not only through the biological therapy. Synovial inflammation could persist independently from type of therapy or autoantibody status.",

Eighty-two RA patients were recruited and followed up for 22 weeks. The clinical, laboratory, and X-ray assessments, along with grayscale US (GSUS) and power Doppler US (PDUS) examinations were performed at baseline, 6, 14, and 22 weeks after infliximab treatment. GSUS for synovitis and PDUS for synovitis and paratendinitis\/tenosynovitis were assessed by a semi-quantitative (0 to 3) score, while GSUS for paratendinitis\/tenosynovitis and bone erosion was qualitatively assessed as absent or present (0 or 1). US scores in both 7-joint (US7) and 12-joint (US12) systems were evaluated.

When DAS28 was used as a reference, the US7 cutoff for disease remission was less than 35 for GS + PD and also less than 29 for GS and 1 for PD, respectively. Additionally, the positive percent agreement, negative percent agreement, and overall percent agreement for GS + PD were 77.78, 76.19, and 76.67 %, respectively, which were all higher than that of GS or PD. US7 may be a feasible tool to assess the therapeutic response in RA patients.",

        "Abstract":"PURPOSE: To evaluate by using B-mode and power Doppler ultrasonography (US) and clinical assessment the response of hand joint synovitis in patients with active rheumatoid arthritis (RA) to treatment with the anti-tumor necrosis factor-alpha agent infliximab. MATERIALS AND METHODS: Wrists, metacarpophalangeal (MCP) joints, and proximal interphalangeal (PIP) joints in 11 patients with active RA were assessed before and 6 weeks after three infliximab infusions. US assessment was performed at a single site in the MCP and PIP joints and at two sites (radiocarpal and intercarpal) in the wrists. Twenty measurements were performed in the wrists; 110 measurements, in the MCP joints; and 103 measurements, in the PIP joints. Two wrists and seven PIP joints were excluded owing to complete joint destruction. US parameters (synovial thickness, number of US-positive joints [ie, with synovial thickness > or = 1 mm], cumulative synovial thickness index, and presence of Doppler signal) and clinical parameters (swollen joint count) were independently assessed and compared with baseline values by using the McNemar chi2 and paired Student t tests. RESULTS: After infliximab treatment, there was a significant decrease in the mean numbers of swollen and US-positive joints and in the cumulative synovial thickness (P <.05). The mean synovial thickness decreased in all joints swollen at baseline and in the MCP and PIP joints not swollen at baseline (P <.01). Change from baseline cumulative synovial thickness correlated significantly with change in disease activity score (r = 0.69, P <.05). The number of positive Doppler US signals decreased significantly (in 13 US-positive joints at baseline, in five after treatment; P <.05). CONCLUSION: US is a feasible imaging modality for measurement of the response of RA small-joint synovitis to therapy. Copyright RSNA, 2003",

        "Published":"2016 Apr",
        "Abstract":"OBJECTIVE: In this study we aimed to evaluate the effect of lowering the cut point of the 2010 criteria to identify more patients with RA among early inflammatory arthritis patients. METHODS: We included early arthritis patients from the Rotterdam Early Arthritis Cohort with at least one joint with clinical synovitis and symptoms for <1 year, with no other explanation for their symptoms. The demographic and clinical characteristics of each patient were recorded at baseline. Patients were classified as case or non-case at the 1-year follow-up by the definition used in the development of the 2010 criteria (MTX initiation). To assess the diagnostic performance of the 2010 criteria, the sensitivity and specificity at each cut point were determined. RESULTS: We included 557 patients in our analysis. At the 1-year follow-up, 253 patients (45%) were classified as case (MTX use). In the group of patients who scored 0-5 points (n = 328), 98 patients (30%) were classified as case (MTX use). The sensitivity and specificity of the 2010 criteria using the cut point of 6 were 61% and 76%, respectively. With the cut point of 5, the sensitivity would increase to 76% and the specificity would decrease to 68%. CONCLUSION: By lowering the cut point of the 2010 criteria from 6 to 5 points, we were able to identify 15% more RA patients at the cost of 8% more false-positive patients.

Joint pain and skin ulcers were poorly controlled; therefore, mizoribine (MZ; 150 mg\/day) was administered once daily from March 2011. In early July 2011, the patient was hospitalized because of acute kidney injury (AKI) and acute pancreatitis. We reasoned that AKI resulted from hyperuricemia during MZ administration because serum concentrations of uric acid (31.6 mg\/dL) and MZ (trough level, 5.14 microg\/mL) were markedly elevated on admission.

        "Published":"2005 Apr",
        "Abstract":"BACKGROUND: Tumour necrosis alpha (TNF alpha) blocking agents lead to pronounced clinical effects and reduced synovial infiltrate in rheumatoid arthritis. Laboratory and clinical studies suggest that TNF alpha independent pathways play a role in the disease. OBJECTIVES: To evaluate the immunopathological effects of combination therapy on rheumatoid synovial tissue in order to identify TNF alpha independent mechanisms. METHODS: 12 rheumatoid patients, including four DMARD (disease modifying antirheumatic drug) naive patients with early disease, were studied for the effect of combination therapy with infliximab and methotrexate on the synovial infiltrate. Biopsies and clinical assessments (DAS28) were carried out before the first and after the third infusion of infliximab. Synovial inflammation was scored semiquantitatively. Co-expression of CD38(+) cells was studied by an immunofluorescent double labelling technique. RESULTS: Marked clinical responses were associated with a global reduction in the synovial infiltrate and expression of cytokines, notably interleukin 18 and TNF alpha, but low grade disease activity persisted. There was no effect on the expression of CXC chemokine ligand (CXCL12), and germinal centre-like structures were still detectable in synovial tissue in two patients after treatment. CD38(+) activated T cells were more resistant to treatment than CD38(+) plasma cells. No differences in clinical response or effects on synovial infiltrate were observed between DMARD refractory and DMARD naive patients. CONCLUSIONS: Persistent expression of CXCL12 and incomplete resolution of lymphocytic infiltrates after infliximab plus methotrexate indicates that TNF alpha independent mechanisms are operative in rheumatoid arthritis. This may contribute to low grade disease activity, even in DMARD naive patients with early disease.",

        "Abstract":"BACKGROUND: Emerging research on the mechanisms of disease chronicity in experimental arthritis has included a new focus on the draining lymph node (LN). Here, we combined clinical-serological analyses and power Doppler ultrasound (PDUS) imaging to delineate noninvasively the reciprocal relationship in vivo between the joint and the draining LN in patients with rheumatoid arthritis (RA). METHODS: Forty consecutive patients refractory to conventional synthetic disease-modifying anti-rheumatic drugs were examined through parallel PDUS of the hand-wrist joints and axillary LNs and compared with 20 healthy subjects. A semiquantitative score for LN gray-scale (GS) parameters (nodal hypertrophy and cortical structure) and LN PD signal was developed. A 6-month follow-up study with serial sonographic assessments was then performed on initiation of tumor necrosis factor (TNF) inhibitors. RESULTS: PDUS analysis of RA axillary LNs revealed the existence of marked inter-individual heterogeneity and of quantitative differences compared with healthy individuals in both GS and PD characteristics. RA LN changes were plastic, responsive to anti-TNF treatment, and displayed a degree of concordance with synovitis activity in peripheral joints. However, low LN PD signal at baseline despite active arthritis was strongly associated with a poor clinical response to TNF blockade. CONCLUSIONS: PDUS analysis of the draining LN in RA allows capture of measurable inter-individual differences and dynamic changes linked to the underlying pathologic process. LN and joint sonographic assessments are nonredundant approaches that may provide independent perspectives on peripheral disease and its evolution over time.",

        "Abstract":"The proposed disease controlling antirheumatic therapy (DC-ART) definition requires that the therapy change the course of rheumatoid arthritis (RA) for at least 1 year, evidenced by (1) sustained improvement in physical function, (2) decreased inflammatory synovitis, and (3) slowing or prevention of structural joint damage. Selected studies are reviewed. All studies were at least 1 year in duration, but most did not include all 3 of the DC-ART requirements. In these studies, patients treated with placebo generally had no improvement in inflammatory synovitis and progressive structural joint damage, judged by serial joint radiographs. A minority of studies significantly favored one or another of the available agents (gold injections, D-penicillamine, auranofin, antimalarials, azathioprine, sulfasalazine, methotrexate), but the evidence for any one agent is not convincing. For future DC-ART clinical trials patients with early RA should be studied. A hybrid study design may be useful, combining an initial double blind randomized controlled clinical trial with continuing longterm observation of all withdrawals using specified clinical, radiographic, and self report assessments at regular intervals, and an intent-to-treat analysis comparing longterm response rates of the original control and experimental therapy groups. Responsive subgroups should be sought, their characteristics identified, and their responsiveness confirmed in additional trials limited to the identified subgroup. [References: 64]",

OBJECTIVE: The aim of this study was to review the efficacy and safety of infliximab in the treatment of dermatological diseases. METHODS: A MEDLINE search (1966-January 2003), using the keyword \"infliximab\" was performed to find relevant articles pertaining to the use of infliximab in dermatology. RESULTS: Infliximab has been used in the following dermatological diseases: psoriasis, Behcet's disease, graft versus host disease, hidradenitis suppurativa, panniculitis, pyoderma gangrenosum, SAPHO (synovitis, acne, pustulosis, hyperostosis and osteitis) syndrome, sarcoidosis, subcorneal pustular dermatosis, Sweet's syndrome, toxic epidermal necrolysis, and Wegener's granulomatosis. There is a generally good safety profile for infliximab, which is similar to that when it is used to treat Crohn's disease and rheumatoid arthritis. CONCLUSION: Although not approved for use in dermatological diseases, there have been numerous reports of the efficacy of infliximab in cutaneous inflammatory diseases. The most promise lies in those diseases that have increased amounts of TNF-alpha in the cutaneous lesions, such as psoriasis. [References: 127]",

Abundant amounts of reactive oxygen species have been detected in the synovial fluid of inflamed rheumatoid joints. It is reported that drugs that block tumor necrosis factor-alpha reduce the oxidative stress marker levels in patients with rheumatoid arthritis. In this study, we measured reactive oxygen species using a free radical analytical system in patients with rheumatoid arthritis treated with disease-modifying antirheumatic drugs, tumor necrosis factor-alpha-blocking drugs (infliximab, etanercept), and an interleukin-6-blocking drug (tocilizumab). The serum level of oxidative stress was drastically low in patients with rheumatoid arthritis treated with tocilizumab, suggesting that interleukin-6 blocking therapy reduces not only joint damage, but also vascular degeneration in patients with rheumatoid arthritis. We believe that such a drastic effect would reduce the incidence of cardiovascular events and mortality in patients with rheumatoid arthritis.",

Prolonged liver inflammation can cause scarring, leading to cirrhosis. The most common first clinical manifestations are pruritus, asthenia or jaundice, but most patients remain asymptomatic. PBC can be associated by itself with arthralgia, but polyarthritis and synovitis are exceptional. PBC is often associated with other non-hepatic autoimmune diseases, especially primary Sjogren's syndrome, which may favour articular involvement. PBC and rheumatoid arthritis (RA) have been suggested to coexist in 1.8 to 5.6% of patients with PBC, but data supporting this association are scarce. We report two cases of such an association.

        "Published":"2010 Mar",
        "Abstract":"Rheumatoid arthritis (RA) is a chronic systemic inflammatory disease that affects about 1% of the adult population. RA sufferers not only have a high chronic disease burden, but may also experience increased cardiovascular disease (CVD) and mortality as the prevalence of myocardial infarction (MI) is 4 times higher in RA patients than in general population, and there is ample evidence showing that coagulation processes are active in RA. Fibrin accumulation in the synovium is one of the most striking pathological features of rheumatoid synovitis and characteristic RA antibodies such as anti-citrullinated protein antibodies (ACPA) can cross-react with epitopes exposed on fibrin and fibrinogen molecules, and thus impair fibrinolysis. The inflammation, coagulation and fibrinolytic systems are modulated by a common mechanism that includes the involvement of proinflammatory cytokines, such as tumour necrosis factor-alpha (TNF-alpha) and interleukin 6 (IL-6). It has long been recognised that extensive cross-talk takes place between the coagulation pathway and the inflammatory process at various levels, and there is growing evidence that this interaction may be relevant to arthritis. Large-scale, long-term studies have shown that anti-TNF-alpha treatment improves the clinical and laboratory measures of disease activity, and reduces local and systemic inflammation. TNF-alpha blockade may therefore also reduce the impaired coagulation and cardiovascular risk associated with RA. This review provides an overview of the pathophysiological role of TNF-alpha in thrombotic mechanisms and the evidence so far available indicating that anti-TNF-alpha treatment can modify cardiovascular risk in RA.

        "Abstract":"INTRODUCTION: Greater body mass index (BMI) has been associated with less radiographic progression in rheumatoid arthritis (RA). We evaluated the association between BMI and joint damage progression as measured by X-ray and MRI. METHODS: 1068 subjects with RA from two clinical trials of golimumab (GO-BEFORE and GO-FORWARD) had radiographs performed at weeks 0, 52 and 104 and evaluated using the van der Heijde-Sharp (vdHS) scoring system. Contrast-enhanced MRIs of the dominant wrist and hand were obtained at weeks 0, 12, 24, 52 and 104. Multivariable logistic regression evaluated the risk of radiographic progression for each BMI category (<25, 25-30, >30 kg\/m(2)). Within GO-BEFORE, piecewise, robust generalised estimating equations marginal models assessed the probability of MRI erosion progression for each BMI category. Multivariable linear regression models assessed baseline associations between BMI and bone oedema (a precursor of bone erosion). RESULTS: Higher BMI category was associated with a lower probability of progression in vdHS score at weeks 52 and 104 independent of potential confounders. Higher BMI was also independently associated with a lower probability of progression in MRI erosion score over 2 years. Subjects with greater BMI demonstrated less bone oedema independent of differences in other disease severity measures, including MRI synovitis in the same joints. CONCLUSIONS: Greater BMI is associated with a lower risk of progression on X-ray and MRI over 2 years. Subjects with greater BMI also demonstrate less bone oedema at baseline. Greater BMI may indicate a less aggressive RA phenotype and aid in risk stratification. Copyright Published by the BMJ Publishing Group Limited.

        "Abstract":"OBJECTIVE: We determined the amount of fatigue experienced by patients with RA, and its relationship to synovitis, pain and other common clinical features. We also examined to what extent RA fatigue is improved by disease-modifying antirheumatic drugs (DMARDs) and anti-tumour necrosis factor (TNF) therapy. METHODS: We studied two cohorts of 238 and 274 RA patients cross-sectionally and examined treatment responses in 30 RA patients starting anti-TNF and 54 starting DMARDs followed for 3 and 6 months. We measured fatigue using visual analogue scores (VAS) and Medical Outcomes Study Short Form 36 (SF-36) vitality scores. We recorded the disease activity score for 28 joints and its components (tender\/swollen joint counts, patient global assessment, ESR), morning stiffness, health assessment questionnaire, physician global assessment, erosive disease, nodules, rheumatoid factor, concomitant medications and illnesses, and the SF-36 questionnaire. RESULTS: Fatigue was common in RA patients; over 80% had clinically relevant fatigue (VAS > or =20 mm), over 50% had high levels (VAS > or =50 mm). It was associated with pain and changes in mental health, particularly depression. In each of the two cross-sectional cohorts, this relationship was similar whichever measures of fatigue and mental health were used. Fatigue fell with DMARDs and anti-TNF: before treatment, 87% of patients had high fatigue, after treatment this fell to 50%. These treatment effects were mainly linked to improvements in pain. CONCLUSIONS: High fatigue levels characterize RA and are mainly linked to pain and depression. The association with disease activity is secondary. Fatigue falls with DMARD and anti-TNF therapy. The balance of evidence suggests that fatigue is centrally mediated in established RA.",

        "Abstract":"OBJECTIVES: To determine the repeatability and response to therapy of dynamic contrast-enhanced (DCE) MRI biomarkers of synovitis in the hand and wrist of rheumatoid arthritis (RA) patients, and in particular the performance of the transfer constant K trans , in a multicentre trial setting. METHODS: DCE-MRI and RA MRI scoring (RAMRIS) were performed with meticulous standardisation at baseline and 6 and 24 weeks in a substudy of fostamatinib monotherapy in reducing synovitis compared with placebo or adalimumab. Analysis employed statistical shape modelling to avoid biased regions-of-interest, kinetic modelling and heuristic analyses. Repeatability was also evaluated. RESULTS: At early study termination, DCE-MRI data had been acquired from 58 patients in 19 imaging centres. K trans intra-subject coefficient of variation (N = 14) was 30%. K trans change demonstrated inferiority of fostamatinib (N = 11) relative to adalimumab (N = 10) after 6 weeks (treatment ratio = 1.92, p = 0.003), and failed to distinguish fostamatinib from placebo (N = 10, p = 0.79). RAMRIS showed superiority of fostamatinib relative to placebo at 6 weeks (p = 0.023), and did not distinguish fostamatinib from adalimumab at either 6 (p = 0.175) or 24 (p = 0.230) weeks. CONCLUSION: This demonstrated repeatability of K trans and its ability to distinguish treatment groups show that DCE-MRI biomarkers are suitable for use in multicentre RA trials. KEY POINTS: * DCE-MRI biomarkers are feasible in large multicentre studies of joint inflammation. * DCE-MRI K trans showed fostamatinib inferior to adalimumab after 6 weeks. * K trans repeatability coefficient of variation was 30% multicentre.",

        "Abstract":"OBJECTIVE: To define the frequency of the exon 6 tumor necrosis factor-alpha (TNF-alpha) receptor II (TNFRII) gene polymorphism in severe and mild-moderate rheumatoid arthritis (RA) and its possible influence on anti-TNF-alpha treatment responsiveness. METHODS: Two cohorts of patients with RA, the first (n = 97) defined as methotrexate responders (MTX-R) with mild-moderate synovitis, and the second (n = 78) defined as nonresponders to combination therapy and receiving anti-TNF-alpha treatment because of their severe and aggressive disease (TNF-T), were studied retrospectively and compared to age, sex, and ethnically matched controls (n = 84). In the prospective study, 66 patients with severe RA were followed over the first 6 months of anti-TNF-alpha therapy and their response was examined according to genotype. RESULTS: We observed a trend towards an increased frequency of the GG genotype in patients with severe RA (6.4%) in comparison with patients with mild-moderate disease (3.1%) and controls (1.2%). When looking at the response to anti-TNF-alpha therapy, we observed that after 12 weeks of treatment, 37.8% of the TT versus 10.7% of the TG\/GG patients passed from high to medium-low disease activity (p = 0.03). CONCLUSION: In our cohorts of patients selected by response to the conventional therapy and by disease severity, our preliminary study results showed a trend towards a higher prevalence of the GG genotype for the exon 6 TNFRII polymorphism in the less responsive patients with more aggressive disease. We also found a lower degree of response to anti-TNF-alpha treatments in patients carrying the G allele.",

        "Published":"2015 May",
        "Abstract":"OBJECTIVE: To investigate whether a strategy combining clinical and ultrasound (US) assessment can select individuals with rheumatoid arthritis (RA) for sustained dose reduction of anti-tumor necrosis factor (anti-TNF) therapies. METHODS: As part of a real-world approach, patients with RA receiving anti-TNF therapies were reviewed in a dedicated biologic therapy clinic. Patients not taking oral corticosteroids with both Disease Activity Score in 28 joints (DAS28) remission (<=2.6) and absent synovitis on power Doppler US (PDUS 0) for >6 months were invited to reduce their anti-TNF therapy dose by one-third. RESULTS: Between January 2012 and February 2014, a total of 70 patients underwent anti-TNF dose reduction. Combined DAS28 and PDUS remission was maintained by 96% of patients at 3 months followup, 63% at 6 months, 37% at 9 months, and 34% at 18 months followup. However, 88% of patients maintained at least low disease activity (LDA) with DAS28 <3.2 and PDUS <=1 at 6 months. The addition of PDUS identified 8 patients (25% of those that flared) in DAS28 remission, with subclinically active disease. Those who maintained dose reduction were more likely to be rheumatoid factor (RF) negative (46% versus 17%; P = 0.03) and have lower DAS28 scores at biologic therapy initiation (5.58 versus 5.96; P = 0.038). CONCLUSION: Combined clinical and US assessment identifies individuals in remission who may be suitable for anti-TNF dose reduction and enhances safe monitoring for subclinical disease flares. Despite longstanding severe RA, a subset of our cohort sustained prolonged DAS28 and PDUS remission. LDA at biologic therapy initiation and RF status appeared predictive of sustained remission.

        "Published":"2010 Dec",
        "Abstract":"OBJECTIVES: To assess the relationship between joint tenderness, swelling and joint damage progression in individual joints and to evaluate the influence of treatment on these relationships. METHODS: First-year data of the Behandel Strategieen (BeSt) study were used, in which patients recently diagnosed as having rheumatoid arthritis (RA) were randomly assigned into four different treatment strategies. Baseline and 1-year x-rays of the hands and feet were assessed using the Sharp-van der Heijde score (SHS). With generalised estimating equations, 3-monthly assessments of tender and swollen joints of year 1 were related to erosion progression, joint space narrowing (JSN) progression and total SHS progression at the individual joint level (definition > 0.5 SHS units) in year 1, corrected for potential confounders and within-patient correlation for multiple joints per patient. RESULTS: During year 1, 59% of all 13 959 joints analysed were ever tender and 45% ever swollen, 2.1% showed erosion progression, 1.9% JSN progression and 3.6% SHS progression. Swelling and tenderness were both independently associated with erosion and JSN progression with comparable OR, although with higher OR in the hands than in the feet. Local swelling and tenderness were not associated with local damage progression in patients initially treated with infliximab. CONCLUSION: Clinical signs of synovitis are associated with erosion and JSN progression in individual joints after 1 year in RA. A disconnect between synovitis and joint damage progression was observed at joint level in patients who were treated with methotrexate and infliximab as initial treatment, confirming the disconnect between synovitis and the development of joint damage in tumour necrosis factor blockers seen at patient level.",

She presented in July 2000 with optic neuropathy and arthritis refractory to nonsteroidal anti-inflammatory drugs. After starting prednisone and cyclophosphamide, she became leukopenic (1.8x10 cells\/microL), a condition that resolved with decreasing of the cyclophosphamide dose. In June 2002, the patient continued to have synovitis despite treatment with prednisone, cyclophosphamide, gabapentin, and celecoxib; blood counts were normal and infliximab was started. Her symptoms improved, but leukocyte counts declined (nadir of 1.5x10 cells\/microL) despite discontinuing cyclophosphamide. She developed molluscum contagiosum after 8 months on infliximab (CD4 count, 492; HIV enzyme-linked immunosorbent assay and Western blot negative). Her symptoms flared after 10 months on infliximab; after the dose of infliximab was increased, her CD4 count fell to 114. Infliximab was discontinued and her leukocyte and CD4 count increased.

        "Abstract":"The effects of intra-articular methotrexate (I\/A MTX) in knee synovitis in rheumatoid arthritis have been previously evaluated. I\/A MTX has not been studied in other joints. Ultrasonography (US) has been little studied in monitoring the effect of I\/A MTX. The aim of the study is to test the efficacy of I\/A MTX in suppression of persistent synovitis in medium-sized joints (ankle, wrist, and elbow) in rheumatoid arthritis patients. Patients were divided into two groups: group 1 (methotrexate group): 56 patients in which 84 joints (32 ankles, 28 wrists, and 24 elbows) were injected intra-articularly by 10 mg of methotrexate in the targeted joint on a weekly basis for 8 weeks and group 2 (steroid group): 44 patients in which 70 joints (26 ankles, 24 wrists, and 20 elbows) were injected once by Triamcinolone acetonide 40 mg. Clinical, ultrasonographic, and power Doppler US (PDUS) evaluation was done before the first injection (W0), after 2 months (W8), and after 5 months (W20). Synovial thickness and the intra-articular power Doppler signal were graded on a semiquantitative scale from 0 to 3 during the US examination. Clinical parameters improved significantly in both groups between baselines and 2 months. In both groups, gray-scale US and power Doppler US showed that synovial thickness and intra-articular power signals were reduced significantly between W0 and W8. The improvement of clinical parameters continued in the methotrexate group up to W20, but in the corticosteroid group, clinical parameters at W20 were similar to clinical parameters at W0. In the methotrexate group, there was an insignificant increase in synovial thickness between W8 and W20 while there was a significant increase in power Doppler signals between W8 and W20, p < 0.05. In the corticosteroid group, there was a significant increase in both synovial thickening and power Doppler signals between W8 and W20, p < 0.001. In the MTX group, all patients at week 0 showed that the Doppler signal in grades 2 and 3 is 100%; at 8 weeks, most of the patients showed that the power Doppler in grade 0 is 76%; and at week 20, most of the patients showed that the power Doppler signal in grade 0 is 28% and in grade 1 is 47%, while in grades 2 and 3 is 23.6%, so there is an improvement compared to the baseline of treatment. Repeated I\/A MTX resulted in a decrease in the degree of synovitis of medium-sized joints in RA patients both clinically and by power Doppler US.",

        "Abstract":"OBJECTIVES: The expanding spectrum of targeted therapies for rheumatoid arthritis (RA) implies a need for development of precision tools for disease assessment reflecting pathobiologic processes. Type IV collagen is an abundant protein of basement membranes, but is also present in the intercellular matrix of the synovial lining layer. We aimed to investigate the association of type IV collagen turnover with RA disease activity, response to IL-6 inhibition and radiographic progression. METHODS: C4M, a serologic marker of type IV collagen metabolism, was measured at baseline and at follow-up in serum samples of RA patients participating in the phase III studies LITHE (n=687) and RADIATE (n=217). Both were double-blinded, placebo-controlled clinical trials testing the safety and efficacy of 4 and 8 mg\/kg tocilizumab (TCZ) in combination with methotrexate (MTX) vs. MTX plus placebo. Associations with disease activity, radiographic severity and ACR response were investigated. RESULTS: Baseline C4M correlated significantly with clinical disease parameters in both study populations, including DAS28, HAQ score and VASpain (all p<0.00001). C4M at baseline correlated significantly with change in JSN (p=0.001) and Sharp score (p=0.00002) at 52 weeks. TCZ lowered C4M by 11-40% in a dose dependent manner. The likelihood of achieving an ACR20 response by week 16 was associated with C4M suppression exceeding the median decrease at week 4 (p<0.0001). CONCLUSIONS: Type IV collagen remodelling was associated with disease activity and radiographic progression in RA and was persistently and dose-dependently suppressed by TCZ. These findings indicate that C4M may serve as a plausible biologic marker of destructive synovitis growth in RA.",

        "Published":"2016 Oct",
        "Abstract":"OBJECTIVES: To study the responsiveness of a combined power Doppler and greyscale ultrasound (PDUS) score for assessing synovitis in biologic-naive patients with rheumatoid arthritis (RA) starting abatacept plus methotrexate (MTX). METHODS: In this open-label, multicentre, single-arm study, patients with RA (MTX inadequate responders) received intravenous abatacept (~10 mg\/kg) plus MTX for 24 weeks. A composite PDUS synovitis score, developed by the Outcome Measures in Rheumatology-European League Against Rheumatism (OMERACT-EULAR)-Ultrasound Task Force, was used to evaluate individual joints. The maximal score of each joint was added into a Global OMERACT-EULAR Synovitis Score (GLOESS) for bilateral metacarpophalangeal joints (MCPs) 2-5 (primary objective). The value of GLOESS containing other joint sets was explored, along with clinical efficacy. RESULTS: Eighty-nine patients completed the 24-week treatment period. The earliest PDUS sign of improvement in synovitis was at week 1 (mean change in GLOESS (MCPs 2-5): -0.7 (95% CIs -1.2 to -0.1)), with continuous improvement to week 24. Early improvement was observed in the component scores (power Doppler signal at week 1, synovial hyperplasia at week 2, joint effusion at week 4). Comparable changes were observed for 22 paired joints and minimal joint subsets. Mean Disease Activity Score 28 (C reactive protein) was significantly reduced from weeks 1 to 24, reaching clinical meaningful improvement (change >=1.2) at week 8. CONCLUSIONS: In this first international prospective study, the composite PDUS score is responsive to abatacept. GLOESS demonstrated the rapid onset of action of abatacept, regardless of the number of joints examined. Ultrasound is an objective tool to monitor patients with RA under treatment.

        "Published":"2010 Mar",
        "Abstract":"BACKGROUND: Several agents provide treatment for established rheumatoid arthritis (RA), but a crucial therapeutic goal is to delay\/prevent progression of undifferentiated arthritis (UA) or very early RA. OBJECTIVE: To determine the impact of T-cell costimulation modulation in patients with UA or very early RA. METHODS: In this double-blind, phase II, placebocontrolled, 2-year study, anti-cyclic citrullinated peptide (CCP)2-positive patients with UA (not fulfilling the ACR criteria for RA) and clinical synovitis of two or more joints were randomised to abatacept ( approximately 10 mg\/kg) or placebo for 6 months; the study drug was then terminated. The primary end point was development of RA (by ACR criteria) at year 1. Patients were monitored by radiography, MRI, CCP2, rheumatoid factor and 28 joint count Disease Activity Score (DAS28) over 2 years. RESULTS: At year 1, 12\/26 (46%) abatacept-treated versus 16\/24 (67%) placebo-treated patients developed RA (difference (95% CI) -20.5% (-47.4% to 7.8%)). Adjusted mean changes from baseline to year 1 in Genant-modified Sharp radiographic scores for abatacepttreated versus placebo-treated patients, respectively, were 0 versus 1.1 for total score, and 0 versus 0.9 for erosion score. Mean changes from baseline to year 1 in MRI erosion, osteitis and synovitis scores were 0, 0.2 and 0.2, respectively, versus 5.0, 6.7 and 2.3 in the abatacept versus placebo groups. Safety was comparable between groups; serious adverse events occurred in one patient (3.6%) in each group. CONCLUSION: Abatacept delayed progression of UA\/very early RA in some patients. An impact on radiographic and MRI inhibition was seen, which was maintained for 6 months after treatment stopped. This suggests that it is possible to alter the progression of RA by modulating T-cell responses at a very early stage of disease. Trial registration number NCT00124449.",

        "Abstract":"OBJECTIVES: This randomised, double-blind, placebo-controlled phase IIIb study evaluated the impact of abatacept on MRI pathology as a primary outcome in methotrexate (MTX)-refractory patients with rheumatoid arthritis. METHODS: Patients received intravenous abatacept (~10 mg\/kg) or placebo, on background MTX, for 4 months, followed by an 8-month open-label extension (OLE; all patients received abatacept plus MTX). Patients had 1.5T MRI with intravenous contrast at baseline, Months 4 and 12; wrist synovitis (three locations assessed), and wrist and hand (15 and eight locations assessed, respectively) osteitis and erosion were scored using OMERACT-RAMRIS. RESULTS: 26\/27 abatacept- and 23\/23 placebo-randomised patients completed Month 4 and entered the OLE; 26 and 21 completed Month 12. The primary endpoint was not achieved; mean change (SD) from baseline in synovitis was -0.44 (1.47) for abatacept versus 0.52 (1.38) for placebo (p=0.103) at Month 4. For mean change in synovitis adjusted for baseline score (sensitivity analysis), the difference between groups was -0.69, p=0.078. Adjusted mean changes (SE) in osteitis and erosion were -1.94 (0.86) and 0.45 (0.43) for abatacept, and 1.54 (0.90) and 0.95 (0.45) for placebo. Further MRI improvements were observed up to Month 12 for abatacept and from Months 4 to 12 for placebo-treated patients switched to abatacept at Month 4. Clinical efficacy was shown with abatacept and sustained to Month 12. CONCLUSIONS: Despite small patient numbers, MRI detected structural and synovial benefit, sustained to Month 12 in abatacept+MTX-treated patients, and improvements in structural and inflammatory outcomes for placebo+MTX-treated patients following addition of abatacept.

        "Abstract":"OBJECTIVE: To investigate whether expression of the four members of the neurotrophin (NT) family and their four corresponding receptors is related to synovial inflammation in patients with spondyloarthritis (SpA). MATERIAL AND METHODS: Synovial fluid (SF) and serum NTs and their receptors were measured by ELISA. Immunohistochemistry was used for synovial tissue biopsy specimens from patients with SpA, rheumatoid arthritis, and osteoarthritis (OA). In SpA synovium, immunoreactivity of the receptors trkA and NGFRp75 was also assessed before and after 12 weeks of treatment with the monoclonal anti-tumour necrosis factor alpha antibody, infliximab. RESULTS: mRNA transcripts of all NTs and receptors were expressed in the inflamed synovium. At the protein level, brain derived neurotrophic factor and NT-3 were significantly higher in the SF of patients with SpA than in those with OA. In contrast, ELISA of serum samples showed that the highest member in SpA was NT-4. Immunohistochemistry demonstrated that the NT receptors trkA and NGFRp75 were highly expressed in the inflamed synovium of patients with SpA, correlating with vascularity and lymphoid aggregates, respectively. Additionally, immunoreactivity of both receptors was significantly decreased after infliximab treatment. CONCLUSIONS: NTs and their receptors are expressed in inflamed peripheral joints of patients with SpA. Their expression is not constitutive but related to inflammation and they may be involved in the local disease processes.",

        "Abstract":"AIM: To examine the efficacy of abatacept in patients with rheumatoid arthritis (RA) using magnetic resonance imaging (MRI) of bilateral hands. METHOD: This prospective study included 35 RA patients. MRI of bilateral hands was performed at baseline and after 12 months of treatment with intravenous abatacept. MRI images were scored for synovitis, osteitis, erosion and joint space narrowing (JSN) according to the RA MRI Scoring System (RAMRIS). The primary endpoint was the change in RAMRIS score from baseline. Repair of erosion was defined as a negative change in the erosion score that was greater than the smallest detectable changes (SDCs). RESULTS: Thirty-one patients completed the study. Median synovitis and osteitis scores showed statistically significant reductions at Month 12 when compared to baseline (synovitis score, -5.5 [P < 0.0001]; osteitis score, -0.5 [P = 0.03]). However, median erosion and JSN scores did not significantly change. At Month 12, 83% of patients showed no progression of erosion scores and repair of erosion was observed in 11% of patients. All patients with repair of erosion achieved functional remission (Health Assessment Questionnaire-Disability Index <= 0.5). The Simplified Disease Activity Index response rate at Month 1 was identified as an independent factor predicting changes in the erosion scores at Month 12. CONCLUSION: Abatacept treatment reduced synovitis and osteitis scores and did not worsen erosion and JSN scores at Month 12. Over 10% of patients experienced repair of erosion.

        "Published":"2011 Aug",
        "Abstract":"There have been numerous reports of granulomatous diseases developing in patients receiving anti-tumour necrosis factor (TNF) therapy. Herein, we report a patient who developed sarcoidosis 6 months after discontinuation of etanercept. To date, all reported cases have occurred in patients undergoing ongoing treatment with TNF blockers with resolution on its discontinuation. A 47-year-old man was diagnosed with seropositive rheumatoid arthritis (RA) in 2003. He was initially treated with methotrexate and corticosteroids. In 2005, adalimumab was added due to ongoing disease activity. However, he had persistent low-grade synovitis of bilateral wrist joints and remained oral glucocorticoids dependent. In October 2008, adalimumab was switched to etanercept with marginal benefit; however, etanercept was continued until March 2009. Rituximab was discontinued due to an immediate allergic reaction. In September 2009, he developed bilateral ankle synovitis with erythema nodosum. Further investigations (chest X-ray and CT scan of thorax) revealed new development of bilateral hilar lymphadenopathy and interstitial nodular changes typical of sarcoidosis. His baseline therapy of methotrexate was continued. His recent repeat chest X-ray and CT scan of thorax (March 2010) has shown significant spontaneous resolution of his mediastinal lymphadenopathy and pulmonary nodules. Apart from the initial brief course of NSAIDs, his sarcoidosis resolved spontaneously without requiring any further therapy. For his rheumatoid arthritis, he has been recently commenced on abatacept and his baseline therapy of methotrexate has been continued. It remains speculative as to whether the concurrence of RA and sarcoidosis is purely serendipitous, or is related to an immunodysregulatory state attributable to TNF blockade.",

        "Published":"2015 Mar 19",
        "Abstract":"BACKGROUND: Rheumatoid arthritis is a systemic inflammatory disease characterized by synovitis and the destruction of articular structures in multiple joints. Methotrexate is recommended as an anchor drug for rheumatoid arthritis treatment to achieve the therapeutic goal of reducing damage to joints and improving clinical score. However, several studies have shown that methotrexate has been associated with the development of lymphoproliferative disorders, namely methotrexate-associated lymphoproliferative disorders. On the other hand, primary central nervous system lymphoma is an aggressive disease with poor prognosis. Both methotrexate-associated lymphoproliferative disorders and primary central nervous system lymphoma are reported to be associated with Epstein-Barr virus. CASE PRESENTATION: A Japanese female patient of between 60 and 70 years of age with rheumatoid arthritis was admitted to our hospital because of sudden convulsion and impaired consciousness. Just before admission, she was treated with adalimumab and methotrexate. Contrast-enhanced computed tomography scan showed a densely stained mass with surrounding edema in both frontal lobes and the left nucleus basalis, and enlarged lymph nodes in the right supraclavicular fossa. We performed a biopsy of the right cervical lymph node, but could not establish a histopathological diagnosis. In situ hybridization showed the presence of Epstein Barr virus, therefore we diagnosed this case as methotrexate-associated lymphoproliferative disorders mediated by Epstein Barr virus after considering the drug history of the patient. After we discontinued methotrexate, patient symptoms gradually improved. The masses at both frontal lobes and the left nucleus basalis were gradually regressed. CONCLUSION: Since the frequency of methotrexate use and the maximum dosage has been increasing, particular attention should be paid to the development of methotrexate-associated lymphoproliferative disorders in rheumatoid arthritis patients who are treated with methotrexate.",

        "Published":"2012 Apr",
        "Abstract":"BACKGROUND: To examine the association between mitochondrial mutagenesis and the proinflammatory microenvironment in patients with inflammatory arthritis. METHODS: Fifty patients with inflammatory arthritis underwent arthroscopy and synovial tissue biopsies, synovial fluid and clinical assessment were obtained. Fifteen patients pre\/post-TNFi therapy were also recruited. Normal synovial biopsies were obtained from 10 subjects undergoing interventional arthroscopy. Macroscopic synovitis\/vascularity was measured by visual analogue scale. Cell-specific markers CD3 (T cells) and CD68 (macrophages) were quantified by immunohistology. TNFalpha, IL-6, IFNgamma and IL-1beta were measured in synovial fluids by MSD multiplex assays. Synovial tissue mitochondrial mutagenesis was quantified using a mitochondrial random mutation capture assay (RMCA). The direct effect of TNFalpha on oxidative stress and mitochondrial function was assessed in primary cultures of rheumatoid arthritis synovial fibroblast cells (RASFCs). Mitochondrial mutagenesis, reactive oxygen species (ROS), mitochondrial membrane potential (MMP) and mitochondrial mass (MM) were quantified using the RMCA and specific cell fluorescent probes. RESULTS: A significant increase in mtDNA mutation frequency was demonstrated in inflamed synovial tissue compared with control (p<0.05), an effect that was independent of age. mtDNA mutations positively correlated with macroscopic synovitis (r=0.52, p<0.016), vascularity (r=0.54, p<0.01) and with synovial fluid cytokine levels of TNFalpha (r=0.74, p<0.024) and IFNgamma (r=0.72, p<0.039). mtDNA mutation frequency post-TNFi therapy was significantly lower in patients with a DAS<3.2 (p<0.05) and associated with clinical and microscopic measures of disease (p<0.05). In vitro TNFalpha significantly induced mtDNA mutations, ROS, MM and MMP in RASFCs (all p<0.05). CONCLUSION: High mitochondrial mutations are strongly associated with synovial inflammation showing a direct link between mitochondrial mutations and key proinflammatory pathways.",

        "Published":"2003 Nov",
        "Abstract":"OBJECTIVE: Inflammatory arthritis of the hands is a frequent clinical presentation with a variable outcome. Patients not satisfying the classification criteria for recognized arthritides are described as having undifferentiated inflammatory arthritis, for which there are no accepted therapeutic algorithms. This study assessed the clinical outcome of patients with undifferentiated arthritis of the hands after use of a treatment algorithm, and evaluated the prognostic features in these patients. METHODS: One hundred consecutive patients with undifferentiated arthritis of the hands were assessed following use of a pragmatic treatment algorithm that was based on clinical presentation and response to treatment. The following standard step-up treatment protocol was used: 1) nonsteroidal antiinflammatory drugs (NSAIDs), 2) a single dose of corticosteroid administered by either intramuscular or intraarticular injection, and 3) disease-modifying antirheumatic drugs (DMARDs). Patients with specific rheumatologic diagnoses were excluded. The primary outcome was persistence of synovitis at 12 months. RESULTS: Seventy-eight percent of patients received NSAIDs, 72% received corticosteroids, and 30% received DMARD therapy. Among patients who had synovitis at 12 months, the prevalence of rheumatoid factor (RF) seropositivity, swollen joints, and synovitis at baseline was greater than in those without persistent synovitis. Logistic regression analysis showed baseline investigations to be poor predictors of subsequent DMARD use, with the best predictor being persistence of synovitis at 12 weeks. Rheumatoid arthritis (RA) developed in 14 patients. Logistic regression analysis showed that significant predictors of RA were RF seropositivity and the painful joint count at baseline. No patient who experienced resolution of synovitis by 12 weeks had persistent synovitis that subsequently required DMARD therapy. Only 13% of patients entered remission. Early resolution of synovitis was associated with an excellent prognosis. CONCLUSION: Undifferentiated arthritis of the hands is not a benign condition, with 30% of patients receiving DMARD therapy by 12 months and low remission rates. Results of the clinical assessment at 12 weeks is the single best predictor of future therapy. This study provides background data for use in determining future therapeutic interventions.",

        "Abstract":"OBJECTIVE: To study the ability of low-cost low-field dedicated extremity magnetic resonance imaging (E-MRI) to assess and predict erosive joint damage in the wrist and metacarpophalangeal (MCP) joints of patients with early rheumatoid arthritis. METHODS: 24 previously untreated patients with rheumatoid arthritis with joint symptoms for <1 year were evaluated at the time of diagnosis and after 6 and 12 months of methotrexate treatment with conventional clinical or biochemical examinations, x rays of both hands and wrists, and E-MRI of the dominant wrist and MCP joints. RESULTS: At baseline, all patients showed magnetic resonance imaging (MRI) synovitis, and MRI erosions were detected in 21 bones (10 patients). 6 (29%) of these, distributed among two patients, were seen on x ray. One x ray erosion was not detected by MRI. At 1 year, MRI and x ray detected 15 and 8 new erosions, respectively, and 19% of MRI erosions at baseline had progressed to x ray erosions. In bones with MRI erosions at baseline, the relative risk of having x ray erosions at the 1-year follow-up was 12.1, compared with bones without baseline MRI erosions (lesion-centred analysis). If bones with baseline x ray erosions were excluded, the relative risk was 5.2. In patients with baseline MRI bone erosion or oedema, the relative risk of having x ray erosions at 1 year was 4.0, compared with patients without these signs at baseline (patient-centred analysis). CONCLUSION: In this group of patients with early rheumatoid arthritis who were treated uniformly, baseline E-MRI erosions in MCP or wrist bones markedly increased the risk of x ray erosions at the 1-year follow-up. Low-cost, low-field dedicated extremity MRI is promising for assessment and prognostication of early rheumatoid arthritis.",

        "Abstract":"PURPOSE: To determine the timing for follow-up study of power Doppler ultrasonography (PDUS) by evaluating the response of finger joint synovitis in patients with rheumatoid arthritis (RA) to treatment including infliximab, an antitumor necrosis factor alpha agent. METHODS AND MATERIALS: Bilateral second\/third metacarpo-phalangeal (MCP) joints and second proximal inter-phalangeal (PIP) joints (total of six joints) in 21 patients (18 women and three men; median age 53 years) with chronic active RA were assessed by PDUS before and after 2 weeks, 6 weeks, 14 weeks, 30 weeks, 38 weeks, 46 weeks, and 54 weeks of infliximab infusion. Pulse Doppler settings were standardized for each patient and optimized for the detection of synovial blood flow by adjustment of color gain, pulse repetition, and flow optimization. Power Doppler signal was graded for each joint [joint grade for power Doppler (JGPD) signals], and the sum of the grades of six joints was defined as the PDUS index [joint index for power Doppler signals (JIPD)] at each visit. PDUS and clinical parameters [28-joint disease activity score (DAS28), health assessment questionnaire, and C-reactive protein (CRP) level] were independently assessed and compared with baseline values. The American College of Rheumatology (ACR) core set responders and non-responders at week 54 were compared for clinical parameters and PDUS index at each visit. RESULTS: Fourteen patients completed the planned treatment for 1 year, while six patients dropped out for various reasons and one died suddenly. PDUS was performed a total of 146 times on 467 joints. DAS28 was assessed 127 times. Both DAS28 and JIPD had decreased at the follow-up. Comparative analysis between DAS28 and PDUS was available 125 times. The transverse correlation between the PDUS index and DAS28 was not significant throughout the follow-up period. When responders and non-responders were discriminated at week 54, a logistic regression model for the binary endpoint of responder vs non-responder, with PDUS index as explanatory variable at time point 0, and follow-up revealed statistical significance from week 38 and on. CONCLUSION: PDUS reflected infliximab's effect on pannus vascular signals; this effect was observed as early as 2 weeks after treatment had begun. Also, the responders to treatment at 54 weeks tended to have fewer JIPD than non-responders in the follow-up period. PDUS may be performed at week 38 or later to foresee the response to the treatment at week 54.",

        "Abstract":"OBJECTIVE: To apply a data-driven approach to investigate, in patients newly presenting with undifferentiated inflammatory synovitis, key variables that discriminate the subset of patients at sufficiently high risk of persistent or erosive disease for the purpose of developing new criteria for rheumatoid arthritis (RA). METHODS: In this first phase of the collaborative effort of the American College of Rheumatology and European League Against Rheumatism to develop new criteria for RA, a pooled analysis of early arthritis cohorts made available by the respective investigators is presented. All the variables associated with the gold standard of treatment with methotrexate during the first year after enrolment were first identified. Principal component analysis was then used to identify among the significant variables those sets that represent similar domains. In a final step, from each domain one representative variable was extracted, all of which were then tested for their independent effects in a multivariate regression model. From the OR in that final model, the relative weight of each variable was estimated. RESULTS: The final domains and variables identified by this process (and their relative weights) were: swelling of a metacarpophalangeal joint (MCP; 1.5), swelling of a proximal interphalangeal joint (PIP; 1.5), swelling of the wrist (1.5), tenderness of the hand (ie, MCP, PIP or wrist (2)), acute phase reaction (ie, C reactive protein or erythrocyte sedimentation rate and weights for moderate or high elevations of either one (1 for moderate, 2 for high elevation)) and serological abnormalities (ie, rheumatoid factors or anti-citrullinated protein antibodies, again with separate weights for moderate or high elevations (2 and 4, respectively)). CONCLUSION: The results of this first phase were subsequently used in the second phase of the project, which is reported in a separate methodological paper, and for derivation of the final set of criteria.",

        "Abstract":"BACKGROUND: It has been suggested that the immunopathology of rheumatoid nodules parallels that of inflamed synovium in rheumatoid arthritis (RA). OBJECTIVE: To analyse the effect of infliximab on the immunopathology of rheumatoid nodules in order to provide new insights into the relationship between synovial inflammation and rheumatoid nodules. MATERIALS AND METHODS: Nodules were present at baseline in six patients with RA and after infliximab treatment in five patients, including paired nodules before and after treatment in three patients. In one patient, the nodule appeared during treatment. Paraffin sections were used for histological analysis. Frozen sections were stained by immunohistochemistry for cellular markers (CD3, CD4, CD8, CD16, CD20, CD68), blood vessels (CD146, vWF, alphavbeta3), and adhesion molecules (E-selectin, VCAM-1, ICAM-1). RESULTS: No manifest immunopathological differences were found between the nodules before and after infliximab treatment. All nodules depicted the classical structure with a central necrotic zone, surrounding the palisade layer, and an outer connective tissue zone. Immunohistochemistry showed the presence of CD68+ and CD16+ macrophages in the palisade and the connective tissue zone, as well as a small number of CD3+, CD4+ T lymphocytes in the perivascular areas. Small vessels were seen in the connective tissue and were sometimes positive for the neovascularisation marker alphavbeta3. They expressed no VCAM-1, E-selectin weakly, but ICAM-1 strongly. ICAM-1 was also strongly expressed on palisade cells. CONCLUSIONS: Despite an improvement of articular symptoms, infliximab treatment had no distinct effect on the histopathology of rheumatoid nodules, suggesting that different pathogenetic mechanisms mediate the two disease manifestations in RA.",

        "Published":"2009",
        "Abstract":"Rheumatoid arthritis (RA) is a chronic multisystem disease. A characteristic feature of RA is persistent inflammatory synovitis, usually involving the peripheral joints in a symmetric distribution. The prevalence of RA is approximately 0.8% of the population (range: 0.3-2.1%); women are affected approximately 3 times more often than men. The current therapeutic approach is to start a disease-modifying agent early in the illness to prevent eventual joint damage. Older disease-modifying anti-rheumatic drugs include methotrexate, sulphasalazine and hydroxychloroquine. Newer ones such as leflunomide and cyclosporin are also used. A recent advance in the management of rheumatoid arthritis is the use of biological agents, which block certain key molecules involved in the pathogenesis of the illness. They include tumour-necrosis-factor-alpha-blocking agents such as infliximab, etanercept and adalimumab, the anti-CD-20 agent, rituximab, and CTLA-4 Ig abatacept. The present study was planned with the aim of evaluating the efficacy of such newer biological therapies in refractory RA at various time points. Databases including Medline, Embase and the Cochrane Library were searched for all relevant studies up to January 2007. A total of 26 studies were included in present meta-analysis. The method of DerSimonian and Laird [Control Clin Trials 1986;7:177-188] was used to calculated a pooled odds ratio (OR) for the American College of Rheumatology (ACR) criteria 20, 50 and 70, at 24, 54 and 96 weeks. The overall pooled OR were found to be significantly more than the placebo at all 3 time points for all 3 criteria (ACR 20, 50 70). In conclusion, biologicals as a group are highly effective in the treatment of RA. Biologicals were efficacious both in treatment naive and methotrexate-refractory patients. [References: 42]",

However, crescentic glomerular nephritis is a rarely described entity among the rheumatoid nephropathies. We report a case of a patient with rheumatoid arthritis presenting with antineutrophil cytoplasmic antibody-negative crescentic glomerular nephritis. CASE PRESENTATION: A 54-year-old Sri Lankan woman who had recently been diagnosed with rheumatoid arthritis was being treated with methotrexate 10 mg weekly and infrequent nonsteroidal anti-inflammatory drugs. She presented to our hospital with worsening generalized body swelling and oliguria of 1 month's duration. Her physical examination revealed that she had bilateral pitting leg edema and periorbital edema. She was not pale or icteric. She had evidence of mild synovitis of the small joints of the hand bilaterally with no deformities. No evidence of systemic vasculitis was seen. Her blood pressure was 170\/100 mmHg, and her jugular venous pressure was elevated to 7 cm with an undisplaced cardiac apex. Her urine full report revealed 2+ proteinuria with active sediment (dysmorphic red blood cells [17%] and granular casts). Her 24-hour urinary protein excretion was 2 g. Her serum creatinine level was 388 mumol\/L. Abdominal ultrasound revealed normal-sized kidneys with acute parenchymal changes and mild ascites. Her renal biopsy showed renal parenchyma containing 20 glomeruli showing diffuse proliferative glomerular nephritis, with 14 of 20 glomeruli showing cellular crescents, and the result of Congo red staining was negative. Her rheumatoid factor was positive with a high titer (120 IU\/ml), but results for antinuclear antibody, double-stranded deoxyribonucleic acid, and antineutrophil cytoplasmic antibody (perinuclear and cytoplasmic) were negative. Antistreptolysin O titer <200 U\/ml and cryoglobulins were not detected. The results of her hepatitis serology, retroviral screening, and malignancy screening were negative. Her erythrocyte sedimentation rate was 110 mm in the first hour, and her C-reactive protein level was 45 mg\/dl. Her liver profile showed hypoalbuminemia of 28 g\/dl.

This review highlights these key advances, particularly the outcomes of genome-wide scans which have provided an increasingly robust appraisal of the complex genetics that underpin RA. Such observations are placed in pathogenetic context, particularly concerning the breach of tolerance that presages synovitis and the mechanisms that subserve chronicity.

        "Abstract":"OBJECTIVE: To determine whether levels of B cell activating factor (BAFF), a member of the tumor necrosis factor family, relate to autoantibody levels, disease activity, and response to treatment in patients with early rheumatoid arthritis (ERA). METHODS: BAFF was measured by ELISA in 48 early RA patients; 21 were examined serially. These data were compared with 49 controls with longstanding RA (LSRA), 48 disease controls (DC), and 50 healthy controls (HC). RESULTS: BAFF levels were higher in ERA, compared with DC and HC [median 4.3 ng\/ml (5th-95th: 0.8-38.8) vs 0.9 ng\/ml (5th-95th: 0.7-4.5) and 2.0 ng\/ml (5th-95th: 0.7-5.68), respectively; p <10(-4 )both comparisons], but not with LSRA controls [median 8.7 ng\/ml (5th-95th: 0.8-46.1); p = nonsignificant]. BAFF correlated with the titers of IgM rheumatoid factor and anti-cyclic citrullinated peptide autoantibody (r = 0.76 and r = 0.49; p < 0.00001, p = 0.0001 for the 2 correlations), and with the number of swollen joints (r = 0.37; p = 0.01). The followup study of 21 methotrexate-treated ERA patients revealed reduced levels of BAFF, with parallel improvement in clinical activity and decrease in autoantibody titers. CONCLUSION: Elevated BAFF in a subset of ERA patients is related to autoantibody levels and synovitis. BAFF level diminished with treatment, along with autoantibody titers, suggesting a rationale to treat ERA patients with BAFF-targeted agents.",

METHODS: Twenty-three patients with RA (19 women, mean age 52.7 +\/- 12.6 yrs, mean disease duration 10.1 +\/- 8.6 yrs) were prospectively enrolled. All patients were beginning therapy with rituximab because of disease activity despite therapy with synthetic disease-modifying antirheumatic drugs and tumor necrosis factor-blocking agents. Patients underwent clinical, laboratory, and volumetric PDUS examination at baseline, 6 months, and 12 months. Ten centers participated in the study. Four centers recruited the patients and performed the volumetric acquisitions of PDUS images, while the remaining 6 centers assessed the PDUS volumes, blinded to the identity of patients and date of the visits. The most symptomatic hand and foot were scored for B-mode synovitis, synovial PD signal, and bone erosions. The repeatability of the volumetric PDUS assessment was investigated. RESULTS: An overall improvement in clinical and PDUS measurements was found at the followup assessments. The mean indexes for synovial PD signal and bone erosions and the number of sites with abnormalities decreased significantly throughout the followup (p < 0.05). The intraacquisition, intrareader reliability was excellent for all PDUS measurements (intraclass correlation coefficients > 0.9).

GSUS and PDUS examinations, 44-joint disease activity score (DAS44) calculations, measurements of erythrocyte sedimentation rate, and C-reactive protein levels were performed in 68 RA patients at baseline and after 1, 3, 6, 9, and 12 months. Metacarpophalangeal joints, wrist, elbow, knee, ankle, metatarsophalangeal joints, and wrist and ankle tendons were examined by GSUS and PDUS. The laboratory and clinical findings began to decrease significantly at 1 month (P < 0.05). Improvement of the ultrasonography (US) variables began at 3 months. After 6 months, all of the joint synovitis scores, except those of the knee, elbow, and ankle joints, showed a statistically significant reduction compared to baseline scores (P < 0.001). DAS44 scores were lower in the very early RA group at 12 months compared to those whose symptom duration was greater than 3 months of RA (respectively, 1.53 +\/- 0.34; 1.80 +\/- 0.38; z = -2501, P = 0.012). The total modified Sharp scores at 12 months correlated with total PDUS synovitis scores at 12 months (r = 0.354, P = 0.003). Regression of US synovitis at large joints such as the knee, elbow, and ankle tended to be delayed compared to that at small joints. PD synovitis that is persistent despite disease-modifying anti-rheumatic drug therapy may cause radiographic bone erosions.",

        "Published":"2015",
        "Abstract":"Rheumatoid Arthritis (RA) is a chronic, inflammatory, autoimmune disease affecting diarthrodial joints and extra-articular tissues; in the absence of an effective treatment, it is characterized by persistent symmetrical and erosive synovitis which leads to structural joint damage and lifelong disability. Several autoantibodies have been associated with RA such as rheumatoid factor (RF) and anti-citrullinated protein antibodies (ACPA). B cells have been shown to play a crucial role in the pathogenesis of RA by producing autoantibodies and promoting synovial inflammation through antigen presentation, T cells activation and cytokines production [1]. Although biologic agents have notably improved disease outcome and patients' quality of life, currently around 30-40% of subjects do not respond to treatment and the mechanisms leading to resistance are still not known [2]. For this reason, new prognostic biomarkers and predictors of response are needed. We and others have postulated that the development of biomarkers for patients' stratification prior therapeutic intervention may be possible through a better understanding of the different histopathological patterns present both in early and established individual RA patient and the related underlying cellular and molecular mechanisms. To date, Tumor Necrosis Factor (TNF)-alpha has been shown to be one of the master elements of inflammation in RA; however, even though therapies aimed at blocking this key cytokine have emerged as a major tool in the treatment of RA, a large proportion of patients (approximately 30-40%) do not achieve a meaningful clinical response assessed by either the American College of Rheumatology (ACR) or the European League Against Rheumatism (EULAR) criteria. The same limitation can be applied to the use of rituximab, a chimeric monoclonal antibody directed against CD20, which is uniquely expressed by all B-lymphocytes during the maturation process from late stage pro-B cells to memory cells. The clinical efficacy of rituximab has been proved by several clinical studies [3] but it is highly variable. Currently, NICE guidelines recommend rituximab in patients with inadequate response to a first-line biologic therapy, including at least one anti-TNFalpha agent independently of their pre-treatment chance to respond. In all cases, whether considering biologics used for several years in RA patients (anti-TNFalpha or rituximab) or relatively newer biologics in clinical use (i.e. tocilizumab, an anti-interleukin (IL) -6 receptor blocking monoclonal antibody or abatacept, a CTLA4 inhibitor fusion protein designed to target the T cell co-stimulatory signal mediated through the CD28-CD80\/86 pathway), no validated biomarkers predictive of clinical response currently exist. Consequently, to date a \"trial-and-error\" approach is used in the prescription of biologics in RA, which has the obvious disadvantage of potentially exposing patients to drugs that they may not respond, with potential unnecessary side-effects, delaying use of an effective treatment and causing a significant economic burden to society. Therefore, identifying pre-treatment predictors of response with a customized stratification approach would be of invaluable importance in RA, also in consideration of the large number of biologics in development targeting novel pathways currently being tested in clinical trials. In this manuscript, we review existing data and provide future perspectives with regard to the role of synovial histopathology as a potential prognostic biomarker for patient stratification in RA, in particular regarding the use of specific biologic therapies.",

        "Abstract":"OBJECTIVE: To evaluate the effect of sustained American College of Rheumatology (ACR)\/European League Against Rheumatism (EULAR) Boolean remission on residual joint inflammation assessed by magnetic resonance imaging (MRI) and to secondarily evaluate other clinical definitions of remission, within an early seropositive rheumatoid arthritis (RA) cohort. METHODS: A subcohort of 118 RA patients was enrolled from patients who completed the 2-year, double-blind randomized Treatment of Early Aggressive Rheumatoid Arthritis (TEAR) trial. Patients received a single contrast-enhanced 1.5T MRI of their most involved wrist. Two readers scored MRIs for synovitis, osteitis, tenosynovitis, and erosions. Clinical assessments were performed every 3 months during the trial and at time of MRI. RESULTS: The subcohort was 92% seropositive with mean age 51 years, duration 4.1 months, and Disease Activity Score in 28 joints using the erythrocyte sedimentation rate 5.8 at TEAR entry. Total MRI inflammatory scores (tenosynovitis + synovitis + osteitis) were lower among patients in clinical remission. Lower MRI scores were correlated with longer duration of Clinical Disease Activity Index (CDAI) remission (rho = 0.22, P = 0.03). At the time of MRI, 89 patients had no wrist pain\/tenderness\/swelling; however, all 118 patients had MRI evidence of residual joint inflammation after 2 years. No statistically significant differences in damage or MRI inflammatory scores were observed across treatment groups. CONCLUSION: This is the first detailed appraisal describing the relationship between clinical remission cut points and MRI inflammatory scores within an RA randomized controlled trial. The most stringent remission criteria (2011 ACR\/EULAR and CDAI) best differentiate the total MRI inflammatory scores. These results document that 2 years of triple therapy or tumor necrosis factor plus methotrexate treatment in early RA does not eliminate MRI evidence of joint inflammation.

The aim of this study was to evaluate if a simple scoring system based on visual assessment of FDG joint uptake correlates with the clinical assessment of patients with RA undergoing antiinflammatory treatment. MATERIALS AND METHODS: Seven patients with active RA underwent whole-body FDG PET and clinical assessment before and after treatment with the antitumor necrosis factor alpha antibody (infliximab). A PET total joint score, ie, the sum of all scores based on FDG uptake intensity between zero and 4 in 28 joints, was correlated with a total joint score based on the clinical disease activity in the same joints using a Spearman rank correlation. RESULTS: The PET based total joint score was similarly high before onset as was the clinical total joint score. The decrease of FDG joint uptake in the follow-up PET scans correlated significantly with the clinical assessment. Additionally, synovial FDG uptake was found in extraarticular sites such as tendon sheaths and bursae. CONCLUSIONS: Visual assessment of FDG uptake shows a significant correlation with clinical evaluation of disease activity in patients with RA undergoing antiinflammatory treatment.",

Intra-articular corticosteroid injections should be considered to preserve joint mobility and muscle strength when medical treatment fails to control synovitis or when marked functional impairment exists. Historically, surgery has been a last resort, but in appropriate patients, it should be considered soon after failure of conservative management.

METHODS: Serial percutaneous synovial biopsies (pretreatment and after 3-4 months) were performed on the knees of 8 patients (7 with RA, 1 with seronegative arthritis) who were beginning oral MTX therapy. Synovial gene expression was determined by quantitative in situ hybridization using computer-assisted image analysis. RESULTS: After therapy, patients had decreased joint counts, morning stiffness, and erythrocyte sedimentation rates. Synovial inflammation in the biopsy tissues was slightly decreased after therapy. In situ hybridization on pretreatment and posttreatment frozen sections was performed to quantify synovial messenger RNA (mRNA) levels. Collagenase gene expression significantly decreased after MTX therapy (P = 0.006) even though cell density in the region was unchanged. TIMP-1 and stromelysin mRNA levels were not changed by MTX therapy. To study the mechanism of MTX action in vitro, MTX-treated and control fibroblast-like synoviocytes were stimulated with interleukin-1 beta (IL-1 beta). MTX did not alter collagenase or TIMP-1 mRNA levels after IL-1 exposure. CONCLUSION: MTX therapy decreases collagenase gene expression but not TIMP-1 or stromelysin gene expression in the synovium. This action is probably an indirect effect due to an alteration in the synovial cytokine milieu, rather than a direct effect on gene expression.",

        "Published":"2013 Mar 02",
        "Abstract":"BACKGROUND: Osteoarthritis (OA) is the most common type of arthritis, causing significant joint pain and disability. It is already a major cause of healthcare expenditure and its incidence will further increase with the ageing population. Current treatments for OA have major limitations and new analgesic treatments are needed. Synovitis is prevalent in OA and is associated with pain. Hydroxychloroquine is used in routine practice for treating synovitis in inflammatory arthritides, such as rheumatoid arthritis. We propose that treating patients with symptomatic hand OA with hydroxychloroquine will be a practical and safe treatment to reduce synovitis and pain. METHODS\/DESIGN: HERO is an investigator-initiated, multicentre, randomized, double-blind, placebo-controlled trial. A total of 252 subjects with symptomatic hand OA will be recruited across primary and secondary care sites in the UK and randomized on a 1:1 basis to active treatment or placebo for 12 months. Daily medication dose will range from 200 to 400 mg according to ideal body weight. The primary endpoint is change in average hand pain during the previous two weeks (measured on a numerical rating scale (NRS)) between baseline and six months. Secondary endpoints include other self-reported pain, function and quality-of-life measures and radiographic structural change at 12 months. A health economics analysis will also be performed. An ultrasound substudy will be conducted to examine baseline levels of synovitis. Linear and logistic regression will be used to compare changes between groups using univariable and multivariable modelling analyses. All analyses will be conducted on an intention-to-treat basis. DISCUSSION: The HERO trial is designed to examine whether hydroxychloroquine is an effective analgesic treatment for OA and whether it provides any long-term structural benefit. The ultrasound substudy will address whether baseline synovitis is a predictor of therapeutic response. This will potentially provide a new treatment for OA, which could be of particular use in the primary care setting. TRIAL REGISTRATION: ISRCTN91859104.",

        "Published":"2003 Jan",
        "Abstract":"OBJECTIVE: To simultaneously image bone and synovium in the individual joints characteristically involved in early rheumatoid arthritis (RA). METHODS: Forty patients with early, untreated RA underwent gadolinium-enhanced magnetic resonance imaging (MRI) of the second through fifth metacarpophalangeal joints of the dominant hand at presentation, 3 months, and 12 months. In the first phase (0-3 months), patients were randomized to receive either methotrexate alone (MTX) or MTX and intraarticular corticosteroids (MTX + IAST) into all joints with clinically active RA. The MTX-alone group received no further corticosteroids until the second phase (3-12 months), when both groups received standard therapy. RESULTS: In the first phase, MTX + IAST reduced synovitis scores more than MTX alone. There were significantly fewer joints with new erosions on MRI in the former group compared with the latter. During the second phase, the synovitis scores were equivalent and a similar number of joints in each group showed new erosions on MRI. In both phases, there was a close correlation between the degree of synovitis and the number of new erosions, with the area under the curve for MRI synovitis the only significant predictor of bone damage progression. In individual joints, there was a threshold effect on new bone damage related to the level of synovitis; no erosions occurred in joints without synovitis. CONCLUSION: In early RA, synovitis appears to be the primary abnormality, and bone damage occurs in proportion to the level of synovitis but not in its absence. In the treatment of patients with RA, outcome measures and therapies should focus on synovitis.",

        "Abstract":"OBJECTIVES: The aim of this study is to assess prospectively the effect of rituximab (RTX) on MRI features of wrist joint disease in patients affected by rheumatoid arthritis (RA). METHODS: Ten patients (6F\/4M, mean age 52.9+\/-15.5 years) diagnosed with IgM rheumatoid factor, anti-CCP positive, RA according to the 1987 ACR criteria were treated with a single course of RTX (2 infusions of 1000 mg, 15 days apart). MRI of the dominant hand was performed with a 0.2T extremity-dedicated machine using pre and post contrast T1 weighted SE, turbo 3D, and STIR sequences at baseline, and after 4 and 24 weeks. MRI was analysed using the OMERACT-RAMRIS score and the dynamic contrast-enhanced (DCE-MRI) technique for wrist synovitis, which calculates the enhancement ratio as both rate of early enhancement (REE) and relative enhancement (RE). The corresponding ME and IRE parameters were calculated also through a computer-aided semi-automated method on the mean of three MRI slices and on a small ROI positioned in the area of maximum enhancement. RESULTS: DAS significantly decreased during the study period (ANOVA for repeated measures, p=0.005). The RAMRIS score did not change along the study, whereas the dynamic MRI values RE, IRE and ME on the small ROI significantly decreased. RE, but not the RAMRIS synovitis score, significantly correlated with DAS at baseline, 1 and 6 months (p=0.005, 0.04, and 0.0007, respectively).

        "Abstract":"OBJECTIVE: To measure the anatomic and physiologic changes in the synovium of patients with active rheumatoid arthritis (RA) before and after the initiation of treatment with low-dose systemic glucocorticoids and methotrexate (MTX). METHODS: Two patients with RA with active synovitis involving the carpus were evaluated by imaging parameters at baseline and again after 14 weeks (of treatment with low-dose prednisone and MTX). Standard clinical parameters, laboratory measurements, and contrast-enhanced magnetic resonance imaging (MRI) (synovial volume estimate) and positron emission tomography (PET) with 18F-fluoro-2-deoxyglucose (18-FDG) (synovial metabolism estimate) were performed. RESULTS: Compared with baseline, standard clinical parameters (i.e., joint count, joint index, morning stiffness, global assessments of arthritis activity, and erythrocyte sedimentation rate) improved dramatically in both patients after treatment with low-dose prednisone and MTX. In concert with this trend, the synovial volume of the affected wrist was reduced by 60%, and 76% and the metabolism of 18-FDG was reduced by 66% and 69% in the 2 patients. CONCLUSION: These preliminary observations indicate that a volumetric estimate of inflamed synovium (using contrast-enhanced MRI) and quantification of synovial deoxyglucose metabolism (using PET) are technically feasible and, in the 2 reported cases, correlate well with standard outcome measures. These imaging modalities may provide new objective parameters to determine RA disease activity and effectiveness of antirheumatic medications; however, the potential clinical utility of these measures remains to be defined.",

        "Abstract":"This study aims to develop a sandwich ELISA system for the measurement of soluble folate receptor beta (sFRbeta) and evaluate whether base line levels of serum sFRbeta are a biomarker for the activity of RA synovitis and the response to anti-TNF agents. Serum sFRbeta from normal controls (41 samples), patients with OA (29 samples), and patients with RA (27 samples) and synovial fluid sFRbeta from patients with RA (17 samples) were measured by sandwich ELISA, using anti-FRalphabeta and anti-FRbeta antibodies as capture and detection antibodies, respectively. Baseline levels of serum sFRbeta before therapy were evaluated in relation with DAS28-CRP or CRP and response to anti-TNF agents at 3-month follow-up. sFRbeta levels in RA synovial fluids were higher than those in RA sera, and sFRbeta levels in RA sera were higher than those in osteoarthritis and normal control sera. A significant relationship was observed between serum sFRbeta levels and the DAS28-CRP scores or CRP values. The area under curve (AUC) values for receiver-operating characteristic curves defined using the serum sFRbeta levels of RA patients before therapy had a higher predictive capacity than DAS28-CRP and CRP for the effective response of anti-TNF agents. The high serum sFRbeta levels with a cutoff value of 8 ng\/mL were 100% specificity for the effective response of anti-TNF agents. The findings support that the serum sFRbeta levels in patients with RA act as a disease activation biomarker and that high serum sFRbeta levels act as a predictive biomarker for the response to anti-TNF agents.",

        "Published":"1999 Jun",
        "Abstract":"OBJECTIVES: CD4+ T cells sustain the chronic synovial inflammatory response in rheumatoid arthritis (RA). SB-210396\/CE 9.1 is an anti-CD4 monoclonal antibody that has documented efficacy in RA when given intravenously. This study aimed to establish the safety and efficacy of the intra-articular administration of SB-210396\/CE 9.1 compared with placebo, examining its mode of action using a combined imaging approach of arthroscopy, magnetic resonance imaging (MRI), and histology. METHODS: Thirteen RA patients with active, resistant knee synovitis, were randomised to intra-articular injection of placebo (n=3), 0.4 mg (n=3) or 40 mg (n=7) of anti-CD4 after sequential dynamic gadolinium enhanced MRI, followed by same day arthroscopy and synovial membrane biopsy. Imaging and arthroscopic synovial membrane sampling were repeated at six weeks. This study used a unique region of interest (ROI) analysis mapping the MRI area analysed to the specific biopsy site identified arthroscopically, thus providing data for all three modalities at the same synovial membrane site. RESULTS: 12 patients completed the study (one placebo treated patient refused further MRI). Arthroscopic improvement was observed in 0 of 2 placebo patients but in 10 of 10 patients receiving active drug (>20% in 6 of 10). Improvement in MRI was consistently observed in all patients of the 40 mg group but not in the other two groups. A reduction in SM CD4+ score was noted in the 40 mg group and in the 0.4 mg group. Strong correlations both before and after treatment, were identified between the three imaging modalities. Intra-articular delivery of SB-210396\/CE 9.1 was well tolerated. CONCLUSIONS: SB-210396\/CE 9.1 is safe when administered by intra-articular injection. A trend toward efficacy was found by coordinated MRI, arthroscopic, and histological imaging, not seen in the placebo group. The value of ROI analysis was demonstrated.",

        "Published":"2014 Apr",
        "Abstract":"Rheumatoid arthritis (RA) is one of the most prevalent autoimmune conditions, affecting approximately 1% of the adult population. It is associated with decreased quality of life and considerable morbidity and mortality. Various inflammatory cells, including macrophages, neutrophils, mast cells, natural killer cells, B and T cells and stromal cells play key pathophysiological roles in joint inflammation and RA progression. Several cytokines, including interleukin (IL)-1alpha and\/or IL-1beta, and tumour necrosis factor (TNF)-alpha, are involved at each stage of RA pathogenesis; namely, by augmenting autoimmunity, sustaining long-term inflammatory synovitis and promoting joint damage. Different cell types are involved in RA pathogenesis through upregulation of several cytokine and soluble pro-inflammatory mediators. As early as the late 1980s, TNF had been identified as a potential target in RA. Five anti-TNF drugs, infliximab, adalimumab, certolizumab pegol, etanercept and golimumab, are now approved for the treatment of RA in various countries. All are bivalent monoclonal antibodies, with the exception of the monovalent certolizumab and etanercept, which is an engineered dimeric receptor. Although all react with and neutralise soluble TNF in vitro, structural differences in the molecules may contribute to differences in their therapeutic effects and the occurrence of side effects. Pegylated certolizumab permits once-monthly dosing. Other mechanisms of action proposed to be important for the efficacy of anti-TNF agents are as follows: induction of apoptosis of both monocytes and T cells; neutralization of membrane TNF; antibody-dependent cell-mediated and complement-dependent cytotoxicity; and reverse signaling via membrane TNF.",

        "Abstract":"OBJECTIVES: To evaluate the ability of tumour necrosis factor (TNF) antagonist therapy to produce remission and prevent progression to rheumatoid arthritis (RA) in patients with poor prognosis undifferentiated inflammatory arthritis (UA). METHODS: Patients with UA of <12 months' duration and having relapsed after a single parenteral corticosteroid injection were recruited into a double-blind, placebo-controlled trial of infliximab or placebo monotherapy administered at weeks 0, 2, 6 and 14. Methotrexate was added at week 14 if no clinical response (raised C-reactive protein (CRP) and clinical synovitis) was achieved. Standard outcomes were collected at baseline, infusion visits and weeks 26 and 52. The primary outcome was clinical remission at week 26. RESULTS: 17 patients were randomised (10 infliximab, 7 placebo) all with poor prognostic features. At week 14, the infliximab group had greater improvements in CRP and Health Assessment Questionnaire (HAQ) but by week 26 there was just a trend favouring infliximab for early morning stiffness, tender joint score, swollen joint score and HAQ; there was no significant difference in 28 joint count Disease Activity Score between the two groups. Furthermore, only three patients were in clinical remission (two infliximab, one placebo). By week 52, 100% patients in the infliximab group and 71% (5\/7) patients in the placebo group had developed RA. CONCLUSIONS: In poor prognosis UA, a short course of TNF antagonist therapy provided modest short-term relief but did not prevent the development of RA. Patients with UA with a poor prognosis relapsing after corticosteroid have a high risk of evolving to RA and are suitable candidates for interventional treatment.",

        "Abstract":"OBJECTIVES: The complement system plays a fundamental role in mediating the activity of rheumatoid arthritis (RA). Biologic therapy can reduce native complement component levels and its activation. We aimed to study the relation of Doppler ultrasound (US) synovitis versus clinical synovitis with changes in native complement component levels in RA patients on biologic therapy. METHODS: This was a cross-sectional study. Ninety-seven consecutive patients with RA on biologic therapy for at least 3 months were recruited. Clinical, laboratory and Doppler US assessments were performed. The Disease Activity Score in 28 joints (DAS28), Simplified Disease Activity Index (SDAI) and a 12-joint US assessment were carried out. Synovitis was semiquantitatively scored in B-mode and power Doppler (PD) mode. RESULTS: A significant decrease in native complement (i.e. C3 and C4) and C-reactive protein (CRP) levels was observed. This was highly significant for C3 decrease (p<0.0005), and C4 decrease (p<0.0005). Synovitis detected by PD US showed significant negative association with C3 change (p<0.008), where patients with higher C3 change were more likely to have PD US inactive status on assessment. CONCLUSIONS: Our results suggested that disease inactive status determined by PD US but not by clinical assessment can be related with decrease in complement in RA patients treated with biologic therapy.",

The clinical improvement noted at the first follow-up (11 months) was sustained throughout this follow-up period (42 months). Three patients (14 percent) have had complete clinical remission and nine others (43 percent) have had an excellent response. Methotrexate was discontinued in four patients between the first and second follow-up because of planned pregnancy (one), gastrointestinal toxicity (two), and fear of toxicity (one). Liver toxicity assessed in these 21 patients and four others receiving long-term methotrexate therapy revealed acute hepatitis in one and elevated transaminase levels in 12 (48 percent). Liver biopsy specimens in 17 patients after a mean of 1,950 mg of methotrexate (range: 915 to 3,125) revealed mild fibrosis in six and no cirrhosis. Methotrexate can continue to suppress rheumatoid synovitis over a prolonged period of time with minimal toxicity in most patients. Hepatic fibrosis and cirrhosis due to methotrexate may be less common in rheumatoid arthritis than has been reported in psoriasis.",

        "Abstract":"The goals of pharmacotherapy in juvenile rheumatoid arthritis (JRA) are to suppress chronic synovitis which causes potential cartilage destruction and deformities, to control the systemic effects of inflammation (including growth retardation and nutritional deficits), relieve pain and limit psychological impact of disease. Currently available methods include nonsteroidal anti-inflammatory drugs (NSAIDs) such as aspirin, salicylates, naproxen, tolmetin, ibuprofen and indomethacin; disease modifying antirheumatic drugs (DMARDs) such as oral and injectable gold salts, hydroxychloroquine, penicillamine, oral and injectable methotrexate, and sulfasalazine; oral (daily or on alternate days), intravenous pulse or intra-articular corticosteroids; immunosuppresants, including cyclophosphamide, chlorambucil, cyclosporin, and azathioprine; and gammaglobulin and other experimental therapies. Over the past 10 years, rheumatologists have adopted more aggressive pharmacological treatment of JRA. As time progresses and the safety of certain drugs such as methotrexate and sulfasalazine becomes clearer, wider and earlier use of these agents can be expected. Still the approach to treatment is a 'step by step' one, starting with the classical NSAIDs and ending with the DMARDs as needed. [References: 70]",

        "Abstract":"The heterogeneity of rheumatoid arthritis (RA) presentation and molecular signature of RA subclasses in patients with early changes of small peripheral joints still remains a challenging problem. In clinical setting, classification of the disease subtypes is not possible and treatment adjustment is based on the continuous Disease Activity Score for disease severity recognition. A new approach in the treatment appears with the novel non biologic targeted synthetic disease-modifying antirheumatic drugs from the group of Janus kinase 1 and 3 (JAKI and JAK3), blocking interleukin (IL)-2, IL-4, IL-7, IL-9, IL-15 and IL-21. We report a case of a 48-year-old patient who had suffered from polyarthritis from his age 40. Initial laboratory tests showed low inflammatory parameters and magnetic resonance imaging of both hands indicated an early stage of RA. Methylprednisolone and methotrexate therapy was initiated. The patient underwent additional tests, but there was not sufficient evidence for a precise diagnosis. According to the European League Against Rheumatism\/American College of Rheumatology score-based algorithm, the patient was classified as seronegative RA based on joint involvement, duration of the disease, and synovitis not better explained by another disease. A partial clinical effect of the administered therapy (steroids as monotherapy and in combination, methotrexate and leflunomide) was noticed with the use of systemic steroids, but dramatic improvement was only achieved with a JAK inhibitor targeted therapy. Although the use of anti TNF-alpha blocker is a proposed procedure and the drug has not yet been registered in Europe, we took the opportunity to apply this new medication option. The patient, a construction worker, was treated for 20 months, which led to complete remission of the disease, without the need of basic or corticosteroid therapy. Full functional capacity necessary in his demanding job was also achieved. This result raised a question of timely introduction of immunomodulators in the polyarthritis treatment steps.",

        "Abstract":"OBJECTIVE: To assess the value of gray-scale (GS) and power Doppler (PD) ultrasound (US) in detecting inflammatory\/destructive changes and for prediction of necessity of re-therapy with rituximab (RTX) in patients with rheumatoid arthritis (RA) over 1 year of followup. METHODS: GSUS and PDUS were performed to assess synovitis, tenosynovitis, and erosions on the clinically dominant hand and forefoot of 20 patients with RA before and after therapy with RTX. US parameters were compared with clinical (Disease Activity Score in 28 joints, tender\/swollen joint counts, and patients' visual analog scale of disease activity) and laboratory parameters (C-reactive protein level and erythrocyte sedimentation rate). Results were compared for patients with and without re-therapy with RTX. RESULTS: Significant decreases in clinical and laboratory parameters were observed after 6 and 12 months. US synovitis scores significantly decreased after 6 and 12 months (P < 0.05 for each). Regarding patients who received re-therapy between 6 and 9 months after the start of therapy (n = 9), a fair therapy response was still detectable before re-therapy. In these patients, PD-positive synovitis was the only parameter that increased up to the 6-month examination. All patients negative for rheumatoid factor and anti-cyclic citrullinated peptide (n = 4) were in the group of patients receiving a second course of treatment. Seropositive patients showed a better response to treatment with less need for re-therapy. CONCLUSION: Response to therapy was measurable by clinical and laboratory parameters as well as by US. Since PDUS was able to detect the onset of disease activity before worsening of clinical symptoms occurred, PDUS is most helpful in evaluating disease activity and making earlier therapy decisions.

        "Published":"2013 May",
        "Abstract":"OBJECTIVE: To assess whether early swelling and tenderness in large joints in patients with rheumatoid arthritis (RA) is predictive of later local damage and whether this leads to functional disability. METHODS: Two-year clinical and 8-year radiological followup data from the BeSt study (trial numbers NTR262 and NTR265), a randomized controlled treat-to-target trial, were used. The association between early local joint swelling and\/or tenderness (at least once, or for >= 2 consecutive visits) and later large-joint damage (Larsen score >= 1) was assessed using generalized estimating equations. The association between large-joint damage and functional ability [by Health Assessment Questionnaire (HAQ)] was assessed using logistic and linear regression analysis. RESULTS: Clinical and 8-year radiological data were available for 290 patients. Concomitant local joint swelling and tenderness at least once in the first 2 years was independently associated with damage of the large joints (OR 2.5, 95% CI 1.7-3.6), as was swelling without tenderness (OR 2.0, 95% CI 1.1-3.6). Stronger effects were seen for persistent swelling and\/or tenderness. Other independent predictors for joint damage were baseline erythrocyte sedimentation rate (OR 1.01, 95% CI 1.01-1.02) and the presence of rheumatoid factor and\/or anticitrullinated protein antibodies (OR 2.5, 95% CI 1.5-4.1; and OR 2.2, 95% CI 1.3-3.8, respectively). Patients with large-joint damage had a higher HAQ score after 8 years than patients without (difference 0.15). CONCLUSION: Early local swelling and tenderness are independent predictors of later joint damage in these joints after 8 years of Disease Activity Score-guided treatment in patients with RA. This suggests that suppression of local inflammation could help prevent local damage and functional disability.",

Eighteen patients affected by RA who were non-responders or partial responders to disease modifying therapy were commenced on Etanercept treatment. Before starting therapy (T0) and at 12 months (T1), the following parameters were evaluated: erythrocyte sedimentation rate (ESR), C-reactive protein (CRP), visual analogue scale (VAS) for pain, number of painful and swollen joints, health assessment questionnaire (HAQ) and disease activity score in 28 joints (DAS 28). Musculoskeletal ultrasound (US) was performed in the following joints: second and fifth metacarpophalangeal, third interphalangeal, wrist and knee joints and a semiquantitative score (0-3) calculated and used to indicate the presence of a localised inflammatory process (synovitis, tenosynovitis, bursitis) and\/or structural damage (bone erosion and cartilaginous change). An overall score was calculated based on the sum of the single scores to obtain a comprehensive score indicative of the global pathological change. The US global scores significantly reduced between T0 and T1 (p < 0.0001). The following laboratory and clinical parameters also significantly reduced: ESR (p < 0.0001), CRP (p < 0.02), VAS (p < 0.001), number of total swollen joints (p < 0.001), number of total painful joints (p < 0.01), HAQ scores (p < 0.05) and DAS 28 (p < 0.0001).

        "Published":"2018 04",
        "Abstract":"BACKGROUND: Synovitis (inflamed joint synovial lining) in rheumatoid arthritis (RA) can be assessed by clinical examination (CE) or ultrasound (US). OBJECTIVE: To investigate the added value of US, compared with CE alone, in RA synovitis in terms of clinical effectiveness and cost-effectiveness. DATA SOURCES: Electronic databases including MEDLINE, EMBASE and the Cochrane databases were searched from inception to October 2015. REVIEW METHODS: A systematic review sought RA studies that compared additional US with CE. Heterogeneity of the studies with regard to interventions, comparators and outcomes precluded meta-analyses. Systematic searches for studies of cost-effectiveness and US and treatment-tapering studies (not necessarily including US) were undertaken. MATHEMATICAL MODEL: A model was constructed that estimated, for patients in whom drug tapering was considered, the reduction in costs of disease-modifying anti-rheumatic drugs (DMARDs) and serious infections at which the addition of US had a cost per quality-adjusted life-year (QALY) gained of 20,000 and 30,000. Furthermore, the reduction in the costs of DMARDs at which US becomes cost neutral was also estimated. For patients in whom dose escalation was being considered, the reduction in number of patients escalating treatment and in serious infections at which the addition of US had a cost per QALY gained of 20,000 and 30,000 was estimated. The reduction in number of patients escalating treatment for US to become cost neutral was also estimated. RESULTS: Fifty-eight studies were included. Two randomised controlled trials compared adding US to a Disease Activity Score (DAS)-based treat-to-target strategy for early RA patients. The addition of power Doppler ultrasound (PDUS) to a Disease Activity Score 28 joints-based treat-to-target strategy in the Targeting Synovitis in Early Rheumatoid Arthritis (TaSER) trial resulted in no significant between-group difference for change in Disease Activity Score 44 joints (DAS44). This study found that significantly more patients in the PDUS group attained DAS44 remission (p = 0.03). The Aiming for Remission in Rheumatoid Arthritis (ARCTIC) trial found that the addition of PDUS and grey-scale ultrasound (GSUS) to a DAS-based strategy did not produce a significant between-group difference in the primary end point: composite DAS of < 1.6, no swollen joints and no progression in van der Heijde-modified total Sharp score (vdHSS). The ARCTIC trial did find that the erosion score of the vdHS had a significant advantage for the US group (p = 0.04). In the TaSER trial there was no significant group difference for erosion. Other studies suggested that PDUS was significantly associated with radiographic progression and that US had added value for wrist and hand joints rather than foot and ankle joints. Heterogeneity between trials made conclusions uncertain. No studies were identified that reported the cost-effectiveness of US in monitoring synovitis. The model estimated that an average reduction of 2.5% in the costs of biological DMARDs would be sufficient to offset the costs of 3-monthly US. The money could not be recouped if oral methotrexate was the only drug used. LIMITATIONS: Heterogeneity of the trials precluded meta-analysis. Therefore, no summary estimates of effect were available. Additional costs and health-related quality of life decrements, relating to a flare following tapering or disease progression, have not been included. The feasibility of increased US monitoring has not been assessed. CONCLUSION: Limited evidence suggests that US monitoring of synovitis could provide a cost-effective approach to selecting RA patients for treatment tapering or escalation avoidance. Considerable uncertainty exists for all conclusions. Future research priorities include evaluating US monitoring of RA synovitis in longitudinal clinical studies.

        "Abstract":"Inflammatory changes (synovitis and bone marrow edema) and destructive changes (bone erosion) were evaluated by magnetic resonance imaging (MRI) in patients with rheumatoid arthritis (RA), and their relations with disease activity were assessed during treatment with tumor necrosis factor (TNF) inhibitors. Ten patients with early active RA underwent MRI at 0 and 16 weeks of TNF-inhibitor treatment. The carpal bones of the dominant hand were evaluated by the outcome measures in rheumatology clinical trials MRI score for RA. After 16 weeks, the mean disease activity score (DAS 28) decreased significantly from 5.54 to 2.70, while the number of tender joints, number of swollen joints, and inflammatory parameters were also significantly improved. The mean synovitis and marrow edema scores determined by MRI showed a significant decrease from 6.1 to 2.2 and 12.8 to 6.2, respectively, while the annual bone-erosion progression score decreased from 12.6 to 2.0. Although synovitis persisted in some patients, imaging remission was achieved in two patients. In conclusion, TNF-inhibitor therapy achieved an early decrease of disease activity and MRI revealed amelioration of joint destruction. The MRI score for RA is useful for assessing the early response to TNF inhibitors.",

Clinical trials have shown that anti-tumour necrosis factor (TNF) drugs are effective in patients with rheumatoid arthritis (RA) refractory to disease-modifying antirheumatic drugs (DMARDs). At about the same time as the European approval of the third anti-TNF agent for treating rheumatoid arthritis (RA) patients, the Italian Society of Rheumatology (Societa Italiana di Reumatologia [SIR]) started a database for the registration and active follow-up of patients with RA treated with biological response modifiers. Since 1999, all patients with RA (ACR criteria) and treated with at least one dose of an anti-TNF agent at four Rheumatology Centres in Lombardy (northwest Italy) have been included in the Lombardy Rheumatology Network (LORHEN) registry in order to track the efficacy and safety of the three available TNF inhibitors during the first three years of treatment.",

        "Published":"2013 Oct",
        "Abstract":"We determined the characteristic features of synovial tissues of rheumatoid arthritis (RA) patients treated by TNF inhibitors in order to delineate their mechanism of action. Synovial tissues were obtained during the joint surgical operations from 12 RA patients who had been treated with TNF inhibitors in addition to disease modifying antirheumatic drugs (DMARDs) for at least 5 months (5-25 months) (RA-TNFinh), and from 12 RA patients who had been treated with DMARDs alone (RA-DMARD), and were evaluated under light microscopy. There were no significant differences in disease duration, serum CRP levels, DAS28, Steinbrocker's stages on X-ray and treatment regimen except for TNF inhibitors between RA-TNFinh and RA-DMARD. The most prominent changes in the synovium from RA-TNFinh were discoid fibrosis in the subliming layers of the synovium with degeneration and detachment of synoviocytes and marked decrease in vasculatures. There was no significant difference in these synovial features between RA patients with infliximab and those with etanercept. Interestingly, appearance of osteoclasts was observed in RA-TNFinh (3 out of 12 patients) and in RA-DMARD (1 out of 12 patients). These results indicate that not only infliximab, but etanercept might have direct actions on synovial cells in the deep lining layers of the synovium, leading to the discoid fibrosis thereof. Moreover, the data confirm that the deep lining or sublining layers of the synovium are the most important portions that steer the disease process of RA synovitis.",

        "Published":"2014 Sep 24",
        "Abstract":"INTRODUCTION: A key phenomenon in rheumatoid arthritis is the formation of lymphoid follicles in the inflamed synovial membrane. C-X-C motif chemokine 13 (CXCL13) is central in this process as it attracts C-X-C chemokine receptor type 5 (CXCR5)-expressing B cells and T follicular helper cells to the follicle. We here examine the role of CXCL13 and its association with disease in patients with treatment-naive early rheumatoid arthritis. METHODS: Plasma samples from patients in the OPERA trial were examined for CXCL13 at treatment initiation and after 6 months of treatment with either methotrexate plus placebo (DMARD) (n = 37) or methotrexate plus adalimumab (DMARD + ADA) (n = 39). Treatment outcome was evaluated after 1 and 2 years. CXCL13 plasma levels in healthy volunteers (n = 38) were also examined. RESULTS: Baseline CXCL13 plasma levels were increased in early rheumatoid arthritis patients in comparison with healthy volunteers. Also, plasma CXCL13 correlated positively with disease activity parameters; swollen joint count 28 (rho = 0.34) and 40 (rho = 0.39), visual analog score (rho = 0.38) and simplified disease activity index (rho = 0.25) (all P <0.05). CXCL13 levels decreased a significantly twofold more in the DMARD + ADA group than in the DMARD group. Baseline CXCL13 plasma levels in the DMARD group correlated inversely with disease activity parameters; disease activity score in 28 joints, four variables, C-reactive protein based (DAS28CRP) (rho = 0.58, P < 0.05) at 12 months. High baseline CXCL13 was associated with remission (DAS28CRP less than 2.6) after 2 years. CONCLUSIONS: In treatment-naive early rheumatoid arthritis patients, plasma CXCL13 levels were associated with joint inflammation. Furthermore, patients with high baseline plasma CXCL13 levels had an improved chance of remission after 2 years. We propose that high CXCL13 concentrations indicate recent onset of inflammation that may respond better to early aggressive treatment. Thus, high levels of CXCL13 could reflect the 'the window of opportunity' for optimal treatment effect. TRIAL REGISTRATION: Clinicaltrial.gov NCT00660647. Registered 10 April 2008.",

        "Published":"2013 Nov",
        "Abstract":"The principles of treating rheumatoid arthritis (RA) have changed considerably in recent years. Disease-modifying treatment (if possible, methotrexate) should be started as soon as the diagnosis of RA is made. The purpose of treatment is to achieve remission or, alternatively, low disease activity, and patients should be assessed every 1-3 months if they have early RA in order to achieve this aim. The same principles of treatment should apply in the elderly. However, it is more difficult to assess RA activity in the elderly. Overall disease activity and\/or pain may be overestimated, as elderly patients may suffer from other diseases. Conversely, the number of joints with synovitis can be underestimated compared with young patients, and regular ultrasound assessment should therefore be considered. Treatment may be more difficult because of concomitant diseases and the increase in drug-related side effects. The role of corticosteroids is still controversial as their short-term symptomatic effects on clinical activity and potential medium-term effect on structural deterioration are counter-balanced by their side effects. Dosages of methotrexate need to be adjusted for creatinine clearance. The anti-tumor necrosis factors (TNFs) appear to be slightly less effective in the elderly. The frequency of adverse effects of anti-TNFs is higher in an elderly population, although the same is seen with comparator disease-modifying treatments. Limited information is available for rituximab and tocilizumab. Uncertainties remain about the management of RA in the elderly as there have been few studies in this population. The safety of the biotherapies therefore still needs to be confirmed, together with the benefit-risk balance of corticosteroid therapy compared with biological therapy.",

MATERIALS AND METHODS: Sixteen Chikungunya IgM positive patients having arthritis lasting more than 3 months in spite of NSAIDs and Hydroxychloroquine therapy were selected. Their clinical, laboratory and radiological features were noted. Disease activity was assessed by clinical parameters and Disease Activity Score System (DAS 28). Functional status was assessed by HAQ Questionnaire on follow-up visits over next 2 years. Effectivity of treatment with Sulfasalazine and Methotrexate was assessed. RESULTS: Chronic inflammatory polyarthritis does occur following chikungunya infection. It involves large and small joints of hands and feet and is erosive and deforming. It is rheumatoid factor negative. AntiCCP antibody was positive in majority. Synovial biopsy revealed nongranulomatous chronic synovitis with infiltration with lymphocytes and plasma cells. It was negative for chikungunya RNA. Treatment with Sulfasalazine with and without methotrexate produced good response in 71.4 % and 12.5% respectively. CONCLUSIONS: Chronic inflammatory, erosive and rarely deforming polyarthritis does occur after acute chikungunya infection in some (5.6%). It is seronegative and AntiCCP positive in majority. DMARDs like sulfasalazine and methotrexate are required and effective in treatment of PCCA.",

        "Abstract":"OBJECTIVE: To evaluate the construct validity of the rheumatoid arthritis MRI score (RAMRIS) erosion evaluation as structural damage end point and to assess the potential impact of incorporation in clinical trials. METHODS: In a randomised trial of early methotrexate-naive RA (GO-BEFORE), RAMRIS scores were determined from MRIs and van der Heijde-Sharp (vdHS) scores from radiographs, at baseline, week 12, week 24 and week 52. Progression in damage scores was defined as change >0.5. Associations of X-ray and MRI outcomes with clinical features were evaluated for convergent validity. Iterative Wilcoxon rank sum tests and tests of proportion estimated the sample size required to detect differences between combination therapy (methotrexate+golimumab) and methotrexate-monotherapy arms in (A) change in damage score and (B) proportion of patients progressing. RESULTS: Patients with early MRI progression had higher DAS28, C reactive protein (CRP) and vdHS at baseline, and higher 2-year HAQ. Associations were similar to those with 1-year vdHS progression. Differences in change in structural damage between treatment arms achieved significance with fewer subjects when 12-week or 24-week MRI erosion score was the outcome (150 patients; 100 among an enriched sample with baseline-synovitis >5) compared with the 52-week vdHS (275 patients). Differences in the proportion progressing could be detected in 234 total subjects with 12-week MRI in an enriched sample whereas 1-year X-ray required between 468 and 1160 subjects. CONCLUSIONS: Early MRI erosion progression is a valid measure of structural damage that could substantially decrease sample size and study duration if used as structural damage end point in RA clinical trials.

Thirty patients (21 women aged 45 +\/- 11 y) affected by RA with remission to moderate disease activity were examined. Both hand joints were evaluated using US, PDI and SMI. Two radiologists reviewed all video clips and evaluated synovial vascularity intensity using a semi-quantitative scoring system. SMI revealed the presence of synovial vascularity in a significantly larger number of patients than PDI (p = 0.02). Inter-observer agreement for US, PDI and SMI was moderate (kappa = 0.59), very good (kappa = 0.87) and very good (kappa = 0.82), respectively. We conclude that SMI detects more vessels than PDI in RA patients. This may allow increased sensitivity for early diagnosis of synovial inflammation, monitoring of its dynamic changes under therapy and evaluation of true imaging remission.

        "Abstract":"INTRODUCTION: In rheumatoid arthritis (RA), P-glycoprotein (P-gp) expression on activated B cells is associated with active efflux of intracellular drugs, resulting in drug resistance. CXCR4 is associated with migration of B cells. This study was designed to elucidate the relevance of P-gp expression on CXCR4+ B cells to clinical manifestations in refractory RA. METHODS: CD19+ B cells were analyzed using flow cytometry and immunohistochemistry. RESULTS: P-gp was highly expressed especially on CXCR4+CD19+ B cells in RA. The proportion of P-gp-expressing CXCR4+ B cells correlated with disease activity, estimated by Simplified Disease Activity Index (SDAI), and showed marked expansion in RA patients with high SDAI and extra-articular involvement. In highly active RA, massive infiltration of P-gp+CXCR4+CD19+ B cells was noted in CXCL12-expressing inflammatory lesions of RA synovitis and RA-associated interstitial pneumonitis. In RA patient with active extra-articular involvement, intracellular dexamethasone level (IDL) in lymphocytes diminished with expansion of P-gp+CXCR4+ CD19+ B cells. Adalimumab reduced P-gp+CXCR4+ CD19+ B cells, increased IDL in lymphocytes, and improved the clinical manifestation and allowed tapering of concomitant medications. CONCLUSIONS: Expansion of P-gp+CXCR4+ B cells seems to be associated with drug resistance, disease activity and progressive destructive arthritis with extra-articular involvement in RA.",

        "Abstract":"OBJECTIVE: Tocilizumab (TCZ) is effective in patients with rheumatoid arthritis (RA) who are refractory to anti-tumor-necrosis-factor (anti-TNF) biologics. The Rheumatoid Arthritis Society Disease Activity Score in 28 Joints (DAS28) is used to evaluate the response to TCZ. However, DAS28 is inappropriate marker because TCZ normalizes C-reactive protein (CRP) and erythrocyte sedimentation rate (ESR) in the early stage of treatment. The aim of our study was to test the usefulness of magnetic resonance imaging (MRI)-based markers of response to TCZ treatment. METHODS: Nine patients with RA who were refractory to anti-TNF inhibitors (six to infliximab, one to etanercept, one to adalimumab, and one to both) were assessed. MRI images of both hands were obtained by low-field extremity MRI at baseline, 20, and 44 weeks of treatment, in addition to assessment with DAS28-ESR. The effect of TCZ on RA was examined by compact MRI score (cMRIS). RESULTS: All patients showed good or moderate response to TCZ treatment, as evaluated by significant reduction in DAS28-ESR at both 20 and 44 weeks (p < 0.001, each, relative to baseline). In contrast, MRI-based indexes (e.g., cMRIS, synovitis, edema, erosion scores) improved significantly at 44 weeks but not at 20 weeks. CONCLUSION: Differences in response to TCZ therapy were determined based on the method of evaluation, suggesting that MRI-based markers are potentially useful for evaluating RA response to TCZ therapy.",

In this prospective, randomized trial we compared three different treatment regimens for shoulder, elbow, wrist, hip and ankle joints: group 1, injection of rhenium-186; group 2, injection of rhenium-186 in combination with triamcinolone hexacetonide; group 3, injection of triamcinolone hexacetonide alone. Each treatment group included 50 joints. Patients included in the study had to fulfil the following criteria: (1) they had to have a diagnosis of rheumatoid arthritis (ARA criteria 1988), (2) their disease-modifying drug had to be methotrexate, started at least 6 months prior to injection therapy and given for the entire study time, (3) their nonsteroidal anti-inflammatory drug had to be diclofenac given at a dose of 150 mg\/day or less and (4) they were also given prednisolone at a dose of 7.5 mg\/day or less. After 3 years of follow-up, 79 joints met these criteria, i.e. 71 joints were excluded from the study: 26 joints because the patients changed the disease-modifying drug (12 joints from group 1, 4 joints from group 2 and 10 joints from group 3); 45 joints because of recurrent synovitis and second-stage treatment (21 joints from group 1, 5 joints from group 2 and 19 joints from group 3). During the follow-up period, joints were assessed for pain, synovitis, joint motion and stage of radiological destruction. Best clinical results and slowest progression in radiological destruction were achieved with the combined injection of rhenium-186 and triamcinolone hexacetonide. Therefore, we recommend this treatment for articulosynovitis with the exception of severe forms, the latter because of the effective penetration range of rhenium-186.",

        "Published":"2015 May",
        "Abstract":"OBJECTIVES: To investigate whether a treat-to-target strategy with methotrexate and intra-articular glucocorticosteroid injections suppresses MRI inflammation and halts structural damage progression in patients with early rheumatoid arthritis (ERA), and whether adalimumab provides an additional effect. METHODS: In a double-blind, placebo-controlled trial, 85 disease-modifying antirheumatic drug-naive patients with ERA were randomised to receive methotrexate, intra-articular glucocorticosteroid injections and placebo\/adalimumab (43\/42). Contrast-enhanced MRI of the right hand was performed at months 0, 6 and 12. Synovitis, osteitis, tenosynovitis, MRI bone erosion and joint space narrowing (JSN) were scored with validated methods. Dynamic contrast-enhanced MRI (DCE-MRI) was carried out in 14 patients. RESULTS: Synovitis, osteitis and tenosynovitis scores decreased highly significantly (p<0.0001) during the 12-months' follow-up, with mean change scores of -3.7 (median -3.0), -2.2 (-1) and -5.3 (-4.0), respectively. No overall change in MRI bone erosion and JSN scores was seen, with change scores of 0.1 (0) and 0.2 (0). The tenosynovitis score at month 6 was significantly lower in the adalimumab group, 1.3 (0), than in the placebo group, 3.9 (2), Mann-Whitney: p<0.035. Furthermore, the osteitis score decreased significantly during the 12-months' follow-up in the adalimumab group, but not in the placebo group, Wilcoxon: p=0.001-0.002 and p=0.062-0.146. DCE-MRI parameters correlated closely with conventional MRI inflammatory parameters. Clinical measures decreased highly significantly during follow-up. CONCLUSIONS: A treat-to-target strategy with methotrexate and intra-articular glucocorticosteroid in patients with ERA effectively decreased synovitis, osteitis and tenosynovitis and halted structural damage progression as judged by MRI. The findings suggest that addition of adalimumab is associated with further suppression of osteitis and tenosynovitis. Copyright Published by the BMJ Publishing Group Limited.

        "Published":"2005 Sep",
        "Abstract":"OBJECTIVE: Interleukin-15 (IL-15) is a proinflammatory, innate response cytokine that mediates pleiotropic effector function in rheumatoid arthritis (RA) inflammatory synovitis. Our objective was to study the ability of HuMax-IL15, a human IgG1 anti-IL-15 monoclonal antibody, to neutralize exogenous and endogenous IL-15 activity in vitro and to perform a phase I-II dose-escalation trial with HuMax-IL15 in patients with active RA. METHODS: Mononuclear cells from blood and synovial fluid (SF) of RA patients were isolated and cultured in vitro under experimental conditions involving the addition of HuMax-IL15. HuMax-IL15 was administered to 30 RA patients who received no other disease-modifying antirheumatic drugs in a 12-week, dose-ascending, placebo-controlled, double-blind, phase I-II proof-of-concept study. RESULTS: In vitro studies showed that HuMax-IL15 suppressed proliferation and induced apoptosis in an IL-15-dependent cell line, BDB2, and was capable of suppressing the release of interferon-gamma by synovial fluid mononuclear cell (SFMC) cultures induced by exogenous IL-15. Furthermore, HuMax-IL15 F(ab')2 fragments suppressed exogenous IL-15-induced CD69 expression in RA peripheral blood mononuclear cells and SFMCs, which indicates that HuMax-IL15 can specifically neutralize several biologic effects of IL-15 in synovial tissue in vitro. In a phase I-II clinical trial, HuMax-IL15 was well tolerated clinically, with no significant effects on T lymphocyte subset and natural killer cell numbers. Substantial improvements in disease activity were observed according to the American College of Rheumatology criteria for 20% improvement (63% of patients), 50% improvement (38%), and 70% improvement (25%). CONCLUSION: These clinical data suggest for the first time that IL-15 could represent a novel therapeutic target in RA.",

        "Published":"2009 Apr-Jun",
        "Abstract":"The aim of this preliminary study is to evaluate clinical and imaging response in twenty patients with early Rheumatoid Arthritits (eRA) treated with Etanercept (Etn) + Methotrexate (Mtx) and to investigate whether clinical and MRI remission may be maintained after biological therapy interruption. Assessment included: radiography, Visser score and anti-CCP antibodies at baseline; disease activity score in 44 joints (DAS44), rheumatoid factor (RF), Magnetic Resonance Imaging (MRI) of hands and wrists at baseline (T0), 12 (T1), and 24 months (T2). MRI was scored for synovitis, bone oedema and erosions (OMERACT study); patients who reached clinical and imaging remission at T1 were considered eligible for interrupting Etn. At T1 8\/20 (40 percent) patients showed a total remission, DAS44 from 5 (T0) to 1.4 (T1); p<0.02, whereas the other 12\/20 (60 percent) showed an improvement, without complete remission, DAS44 from 4.8 (T0) to 2.8 (T1); p<0.05. Etn was therefore interrupted in the first group of patients (group A), whereas it was continued in the other group (group B). At T2, group A maintained clinical remission and group B showed further not significant DAS44 reduction from T1. At T1, a significant reduction in synovitis, bone oedema and total score (p<0.01) was observed both in group A and in group B. At T2, group A showed an increase in all the MRI scores that was significant for the synovitis and total score, whereas group B exhibited a further not significant reduction. This preliminary study reports an excellent clinical and imaging response in eRA patients treated with Etn with total remission in 40 percent of them after a 1-year therapy period. However, it indicates that joint damage may progress, despite a sustained clinical remission, after Etn suspension.",

        "Published":"2017",
        "Abstract":"The objective of this study was to compare the scope and the discriminative power of Dynamic Contrast Enhanced Magnetic Resonance Imaging (DCE-MRI) to those of semi-quantitative MRI scoring for evaluating treatments for rheumatoid arthritis (RA) in multicenter randomized clinical trials (RCTs). Sixty-one patients with active RA participated in a double-blind, parallel group, randomized, multicenter methodology study receiving infliximab or placebo through 14 weeks. The most symptomatic wrist and metacarpophalangeal joints (MCPs) were imaged using MRI. In addition to clinical assessments with DAS28(CRP), the severity of inflammation was measured as synovial leak of gadolinium based contrast agent (GBCA) using DCE-MRI (Ktrans, primary endpoint) at weeks 0, 2, 4, and 14. Two radiologists independently scored synovitis, osteitis and erosion using RA MRI Score (RAMRIS) and cartilage loss using a 9-point MRI scale (CARLOS). Infliximab showed greater decrease from baseline in DAS28(CRP), DCE-MRI Ktrans of wrist and MCP synovium, and RAMRIS synovitis and osteitis at all visits compared with placebo (p<0.001). Treatment effect sizes of infliximab therapy were similar for DAS28(CRP) (1.08; 90% CI (0.63-1.53)) and MRI inflammation endpoints: wrist Ktrans (1.00 (0.55-1.45)), RAMRIS synovitis (0.85 (0.38-1.28)) and RAMRIS osteitis (0.99 (0.52-1.43)). Damage measures of bone erosion (RAMRIS) and cartilage loss (CARLOS) were reduced with infliximab compared to with placebo at 14 weeks (p<=0.025). DCE-MRI and RAMRIS were equally sensitive and responsive to the anti-inflammatory effects of infliximab. RAMRIS and CARLOS showed suppression of erosion and cartilage loss, respectively, at 14 weeks.

        "Published":"2013 Apr",
        "Abstract":"OBJECTIVE: The 2010 American College of Rheumatology\/European League Against Rheumatism (ACR\/EULAR) classification criteria for rheumatoid arthritis (RA) refer to a possible use of ultrasound \"for confirmation of the clinical findings.\" We undertook this study to determine the optimized definition of ultrasound-detected synovitis for the 2010 ACR\/EULAR criteria and to assess the impact of its use on the accuracy of RA classification. METHODS: One hundred nine patients with musculoskeletal symptoms for <=3 years were enrolled in the study. Patients underwent clinical, laboratory, radiographic, and comprehensive ultrasonographic assessments at baseline and received routine management from expert rheumatologists who were blinded to the ultrasound findings. RESULTS: Sensitivity and specificity of the 2010 ACR\/EULAR criteria using different definitions of synovitis to identify patients who developed a disease requiring methotrexate (MTX) treatment within 1 year were 58.5% and 79.4%, respectively, for clinical synovitis (tenderness or swelling), 78.0% and 79.4%, respectively, for ultrasound-detected synovitis with a gray-scale (GS) imaging score>=1 (GS>=1 ultrasound synovitis), and 56.1% and 93.7%, respectively, for GS>=2 ultrasound synovitis or a synovial power Doppler (PD) signal score>=1 (GS>=2\/PD>=1 ultrasound synovitis). Receiver operating characteristic curve analysis for the criteria scores revealed the largest area under the curve with GS>=2\/PD>=1 ultrasound synovitis. CONCLUSION: Ultrasound assessment improves the accuracy of the 2010 ACR\/EULAR criteria for identifying patients with a disease requiring MTX treatment. Our data provide preliminary but vital information for the methodology to confirm the presence of synovitis using ultrasound in the 2010 ACR\/EULAR criteria.

        "Abstract":"The aim of this study was to assess the impact of tocilizumab on bone oedema in rheumatoid arthritis (RA) as shown by magnetic resonance imaging (MRI). In this longitudinal study, patients with rheumatoid arthritis according to the American College of Rheumatology (ACR) 2009 criteria with inadequate response or intolerance to disease-modifying anti-rheumatic drugs (DMARDs), treated with tocilizumab, were included. Sociodemographic characteristics and clinical and laboratory data for the disease were collected at baseline (M0) and 06 months (M6) of treatment. Disease activity was assessed using disease activity score in 28 joints (DAS28), simplified disease activity index (SDAI) and clinical disease activity index (CDAI). MRI of the dominant hand was performed at baseline and M6 of treatment. The primary outcome measure was the assessment of bone oedema by rheumatoid arthritis MRI scoring system (RAMRIS) bone oedema. Secondary outcomes included RAMRIS synovitis, DAS28, C-reactive protein (CRP) and SDAI at baseline and M6. Twenty-two patients with RA were included, 19 females (86.4 %), with a mean of age 42 +\/- 13.7. The mean disease duration was 8 +\/- 5.2 years. The mean DAS28 was 5.78 +\/- 0.87. The median CRP was 16 mg\/l (6.7 to 36.3). The average SDAI was 90 +\/- 34. Three patients were excluded from the study for serious side effects. At baseline, bone oedema was present in 41 % of patients (N = 9), with a median bone oedema RAMRIS 0 (0 to 7.2). At M6, bone oedema decreased or disappeared in 32 % (N = 7) with a significant improvement in the RAMRIS bone oedema score (p = 0.04). Moreover, there is a significant improvement in RAMRIS synovitis (p < 0.0001) as well as in activity parameters: DAS28 (p < 0.0001), CRP (p < 0.0001) and SDAI (p < 0.0001). This study suggests that tocilizumab is associated with a significant improvement on MRI-determined bone oedema in the short term. This improvement in bone oedema is correlated with improved parameters of disease activity, in which early structural effect could be discussed. Further studies are needed to confirm these results.",
