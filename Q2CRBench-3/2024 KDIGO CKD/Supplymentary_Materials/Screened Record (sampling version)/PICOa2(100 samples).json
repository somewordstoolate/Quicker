        "Abstract":"We investigated the relationship between atrial fibrillation (AF) and contrast-induced nephropathy (CIN) in patients with non-ST-segment elevation myocardial infarction (NSTEMI); 1045 consecutive patients undergoing percutaneous coronary interventions were enrolled. Risk factors for CIN were investigated. Baseline characteristics, except oral anticoagulant use, were similar between patients with and without AF. Patients with CIN show higher presence of diabetes mellitus (DM), coronary artery bypass graft surgery history, Mehran score, baseline creatinine levels, baseline glomerular filtration rate (GFR), peak troponin levels, left ventricular ejection fraction (LVEF), and presence of AF ( P < .05). In multivariate logistic regression analyses, the presence of DM (odds ratio [OR], 2.333; 95% confidence interval [CI], 1.222-4.457; P = .010), Mehran score (OR, 1.269; 95% CI, 1.152-1.398; P < .001), baseline GFR (OR, 0,954; 95% CI, 0.944-0.964 P < .001), left anterior descending artery originated infarction (OR, 1.594; 95% CI, 1.061-2.398; P = .025), LVEF value (OR, 0.956; 95% CI, 0.926-0.986; P = .005), and the presence of AF (OR, 3.830; 95% CI, 1.239-11.839; P = .020) were independent predictors of CIN. Atrial fibrillation can be related to CIN development in patients with NSTEMI.",

        "Abstract":"['2', '2', '2']\nGlomerular filtration rate (GFR) assessment is indicated before every administration of cisplatin. The optimal modality for this purpose [GFR measurement by urinary Creatinine Clearance (uCrCl) versus GFR estimation (eGFR) by the CKD-EPI formula versus both] is unclear. We investigated whether eGFR only is safe in this setting. Paired uCrCl and eGFR determinations from 470 cisplatin cycles from 121 patients were analyzed [median age: 55 years; most frequent tumor site: genitourinary (45%); palliative treatment: n = 41 (34%)]. Primary endpoint was the proportion of cycles with uCrCl < 50 ml\/min\/1.73m and eGFR ≥ 50 ml\/min\/1.73m (i.e. a \"false negative\" result when only determining eGFR). The primary endpoint occurred in 8 of 470 cisplatin cycles (1.7%, 95%CI 0.5-2.9). In all 8 events, uCrCl was lower than eGFR (mean uCrCl vs. eGFR: 43 versus 112 ml\/min\/1.73m). The uCrCl was re-measured in all patients, and showed normal results in all but 1 patient. None of these events precluded the administration of cisplatin at the planned date, and no subsequent cases of acute nephrotoxicity occurred. Overall agreement between uCrCl and eGFR was low, with qualitative analysis suggesting frequent incompliance with 24-h urine collection. We conclude that an eGFR is sufficient for assessing kidney function in patients with cancer undergoing cisplatin therapy.",

        "Abstract":"BACKGROUND: Early detection of renal dysfunction is important in burn patients. This study evaluated whether serum cystatin C (CysC) is a potentially accurate and sensitive marker for identification of reduced glomerular filtration rate (GFR) and the risk factors of impaired renal function in major burn patients.\nMETHODS: A total of 48 adult patients with major burn injury were enrolled. Renal function was assessed using serum creatinine (sCr), 24-h urinary creatinine clearance (24-hCrCl), sCr-based formulae and CysC-based formulae on the second day and seventh day post-burn.\nRESULTS: There was a high prevalence (27.1%) of acute impaired renal function in major burn patients in the first week post-burn. CysC-based formulae for estimated GFR (eGFR) are more accurate and sensitive for detection of impaired renal function than sCr-based formulae. Multivariate logistic regression analysis demonstrated that age (OR, 2.08; 95% CI 1.26-4.77) and the percentage of burn area (OR, 3.41; 95% CI 1.64-6.95) were independent risk factors of impaired renal function.\nCONCLUSIONS: The results of this study suggest that CysC is a more accurate and sensitive marker for identification of acute impaired renal function in major burn patients than sCr. It is important to measure CysC and calculate eGFR to prevent acute renal failure and modify drug doses in burn patients, especially those of older age and with major burn areas.",

We investigated whether reduced estimated glomerular filtration rate (eGFR) and albuminuria are associated with subclinical vascular disease, as assessed by carotid intima-medial thickness (cIMT).\nMETHODS: Cross-sectional analysis of 476 HIV-infected individuals without clinical evidence of CVD enrolled in the Fat Redistribution and Metabolic Change in HIV infection (FRAM) study, using multivariable linear regression. eGFR(Cys) and eGFR(Cr) were calculated from cystatin C and creatinine levels. Albuminuria was defined as a positive urine dipstick (≥ 1+) or urine albumin-to-creatinine ratio ≥ 30 mg\/g. Common and internal cIMT were measured by high-resolution B-mode ultrasound.\nRESULTS: In unadjusted analyses, eGFR(Cys) and eGFR(Cr) were strongly associated with com- mon and internal cIMT. Each 10 ml\/min\/1.73 m2 decrease in eGFR(Cys) and eGFR(cr) was associated with a 0.008 mm higher common cIMT (p = 0.003, p = 0.01) and a 0.024 and 0.029 mm higher internal cIMT (p = 0.003), respectively. These associations were eliminated after adjustment for age, gender, and race. Albuminuria showed little association with common or internal cIMT in all models.\nCONCLUSIONS: In HIV-infected individuals without prior CVD, reduced kidney function and albuminuria were not independently associated with subclinical vascular disease, as assessed by cIMT. These results suggest that research should focus on searching for novel mechanisms by which kidney disease confers cardiovascular risk in HIV-infected individuals.",

Fewer patients (n=484, 8.5%) met UO diagnostic criteria with assumed body weight (70 kg) than with known weight (n=624, 10.9%). Agreement between SCr and UO criteria was fair (κ=0.28; 95% confidence interval 0.25-0.31). UO diagnostic criteria were specific (0.95; 0.94-0.95) but insensitive (0.36; 0.33-0.39) compared with SCr. Intravenous diuretics were associated with higher probability of falling below the UO diagnostic threshold compared with SCr, higher 30-day mortality (relative risk, 2.27; 1.08-4.76), and the need for renal support (4.35; 1.82-10.4) compared with no diuretics.\nCONCLUSIONS: Common surrogates for baseline estimated GFR and body weight were associated with misclassification of AKIN stage.

We measured GFR and compared the performance of the Modification of Diet in Renal Disease (MDRD), the Chronic Kidney Disease-Epidemiology Collaboration (CKD-Epi) and the Berlin Initiative Study (BIS) equations based on creatinine and\/or cystatin C in octogenarians and nonagenarians.\nMETHODS: Using cross-sectional analysis we assessed 95 very elderly persons (mean 85 years) living in the community. GFR was measured by iohexol (mGFR) and compared with estimates using six equations: MDRD, CKD-Epi_creatinine, CKD-Epi_cystatin, CKD-Epi_creatinine-cystatin, BIS_creatinine and BIS_creatinine-cystatin.\nRESULTS: Mean mGFR was 55 (range,19-86) ml\/min\/1.73 m(2). Bias was smaller with the CKD-Epi_creatinine-cystatin and the CKD-Epi_creatinine equations (-4.0 and 1.7 ml\/min\/1.73 m(2)). Accuracy (percentage of estimates within 30% of mGFR) was greater with the CKD-Epi_creatinine-cystatin, BIS_creatinine-cystatin and BIS_creatinine equations (85%, 83% and 80%, respectively). Among the creatinine-based equations, the BIS_creatinine had the greatest accuracy at mGFR < 60 ml\/min\/1.73 m(2) and the CKD-Epi_creatinine was superior at higher GFRs (79% and 90%, respectively). The CKD-Epi_creatinine-cystatin, BIS_creatinine-cystatin and CKD-Epi_cystatin equations yielded the greatest areas under the receiver operating characteristic curve at GFR threshold = 60 ml\/min\/1.73 m 2 (0.88, 0.88 and 0.87, respectively). In participants classified based on the BIS_creatinine, CKD-Epi_cystatin, or BIS_creatinine-cystatin equations, the CKD-Epi_creatinine-cystatin equation tended to improve CKD classification (net reclassification index: 12.7%, p = 0.18; 6.7%, p = 0.38; and 15.9%; p = 0.08, respectively).\nCONCLUSIONS: GFR-estimating equations CKD-Epi_creatinine-cystatin and BIS_creatinine-cystatin showed better accuracy than other equations using creatinine or cystatin C alone in very elderly persons. The CKD-Epi_creatinine-cystatin equation appears to be advantageous in CKD classification.

        "Abstract":"['2', '2']\nImpaired renal function after pediatric (LT) is a recognized problem. Accurate monitoring of (GFR) is imperative to detect declining renal function. GFR can be estimated via s-creatinine and\/or p-cystatin C or measured by inulin and or\/iohexol clearances. We retrospectively compared eGFRcrea and eGFRcyst, to mGFRiohex after LT. Data from 91 children with 312 concomitant measurements of s-creatinine, p-cystatin C, and iohexol clearance, obtained between 2007 and 2015, were analyzed. eGFR was calculated by using the p-cystatin C-based CAPA and CKD-EPI formulas, and the s-creatinine-based Schwartz-LYON, FAS, revised Schwartz and MDRD formulas. Also, the arithmetic means of cystatin C-based and creatinine-based equations were used. Every calculated eGFR was compared to mGFRiohex in statistical correlation, accuracy, precision, bias, and misclassifications. Among the different equations, p-cystatin C-based formulas (CAPA and CKD-EPI) as well as the s-creatinine-based Schwartz-LYON formula showed the most correct estimates regarding accuracy (84-87.5%), bias (0.19-4.0 ml\/min\/1.73 m ), and misclassification rate (24.7-25%). In patients with renal function <75 ml\/min\/1.73 m , cystatin C-based formulas were significantly more accurate and less biased than creatinine-based formulas. In conclusion, S-creatinine could be used in a clinical setting on a regular basis in liver transplanted pediatric patients, with reliable results, if eGFR is calculated by the Schwartz-LYON formula. When suspected renal dysfunction, cystatin C-based eGFR should be calculated, since it gives more accurate and less biased estimates than creatinine-based eGFR, and should be confirmed by mGFR (iohexol).",

A total of 116 patients (53%) either died or were hospitalized for HF during follow-up.

        "Abstract":"Diabetic microalbuminuria, which predisposes to the irreversible macroproteinuria and terminal renal failure, has been shown to be reversible by stringent metabolic control. In this study, using logistic regression, 23 patients with insulin-dependent diabetes mellitus were evaluated. Basing on the reported biochemical changes in patients with diabetes mellitus, the relationship between microalbuminuria and serum biochemistries was assessed. Four biochemical parameters were shown to be significantly related to the amount of microalbuminuria and microproteinuria. The microalbuminuria as assayed by rocket immunoelectrophoresis is closely correlated with the microproteinuria as measured by the Coomassie dye binding method and both have a significant relationship with plasma creatinine, bicarbonate, albumin and globulin as assessed by the Minitab computer program and the Biomedical Data Package--Logistic Regression computer program. The relationship with bicarbonate and creatinine can be due to a decrease in glomerular filtration rate associated with more advanced microproteinuria. The relationship with albumin and globulin is the result of impaired albumin synthesis by the liver in diabetes mellitus. From these data, two simple equations which can provide a relative risk factor with rough quantitative assessment for microproteinuria and microalbuminuria are derived. Thus, from these four parameters available from relatively simple blood biochemistries, assessment can be made of the severity of coexisting diabetic proteinuria. The measurement of the latter is not readily available and is more costly and tedious. This assessment together with the finding of a decrease in albumin, slight increase in creatinine and decrease in bicarbonate associated with the more severe microalbuminuria can be used to alert the diabetologist in implementing tighter metabolic control and other interventional methods before irreversible macroproteinuria develops.",

        "Abstract":"INTRODUCTION: Several randomised controlled trials have demonstrated better outcomes with primary percutaneous coronary intervention (PCI) over fibrinolytic therapy in the treatment of patients with ST-segment elevation myocardial infarction (STEMI) and normal renal function. Whether this benefit extends to patients with impaired renal function is uncertain.\nMATERIALS AND METHODS: We studied 1672 patients with STEMI within 12 hours of symptom onset who were admitted to 2 major public hospitals in Singapore from 2000 to 2002. All patients received either upfront fibrinolytic or PCI as determined by the attending cardiologist. Serum creatinine was measured on admission and the glomerular filtration rate (GFR) was determined using the Modification of Diet in Renal Disease equation. The impact of reperfusion strategy on 30-ay mortality was then determined for patients with GFR > or =60 mL min-(1) 1.73 m-(2) and GFR <60 mL min-(1) 1.73 m-(2).\nRESULTS: The mean age was 56 +\/- 12 years (85% male) and mean GFR was 81 +\/- 30 mL min-(1) 1.73 m-(2). Unadjusted 30-day mortality rates for fibrinolytic-treated vs primary PCI-treated patients were 29.4% vs 17.9%, P <0.05, in the impaired renal function group and 5.4% vs 3.1%, P <0.05, in the normal renal function group. After adjusting for covariates, primary PCI was associated with a significantly lower mortality in the normal renal function group [odds ratio (OR), 0.41; 95% confidence interval (CI), 0.19-0.89] but not in the impaired renal function group [OR, 0.70; 95% CI, 0.31-1.60].\nCONCLUSIONS: Primary PCI was associated with improved 30-day survival among patients with normal renal function but not among those with impaired renal function. Randomised trials are needed to study the relative efficacy of both reperfusion strategies in patients with impaired renal function.",

        "Abstract":"OBJECTIVE: In type 2 diabetes, prevalence of nonalbuminuric renal impairment is increasing worldwide, though its clinical significance remains unclear. This large-cohort study aimed at evaluating the association of this phenotype with cardiovascular risk factors and other complications.\nMETHODS: Type 2 diabetic patients from the Renal Insufficiency And Cardiovascular Events (RIACE) Italian Multicenter Study (n = 15,773), visiting consecutively 19 hospital-based Diabetes Clinics in years 2007-2008, were examined. Serum creatinine was assessed by the Jaffe method; albuminuria was measured by immunonephelometry or immunoturbidimetry.\nRESULTS: Of patients with renal impairment, as identified by an estimated glomerular filtration rate (eGFR) less than 60 ml\/min per 1.73 m², 56.6% were normoalbuminuric, 30.8% were microalbuminuric, and 12.6% were macroalbuminuric. Percentages were similar when GFR was estimated using the more accurate Chronic Kidney Disease Epidemiology Collaboration equation instead of the simplified Modification of Diet in Renal Disease formula, and were independent of age, thus indicating that the increasing prevalence of this phenotype does not reflects misclassification of elderly patients. Nonalbuminuric renal impairment was not associated with HbA(1c) and correlated less strongly with retinopathy and hypertension than albuminuria, either alone or associated with reduced eGFR. It was associated with a higher prevalence of cardiovascular disease (CVD) than albuminuria alone, but lower than albuminuric renal impairment. Female sex correlated with nonalbuminuric renal impairment and male sex with the albuminuric forms.\nCONCLUSIONS: These data show that type 2 diabetic patients with nonalbuminuric renal impairment exhibit distinct clinical features, suggesting predominance of macroangiopathy as underlying renal pathology, and that this phenotype is associated with significant CVD burden.",

        "Abstract":"BACKGROUND AND OBJECTIVES: In older adults, data on the age-related course of GFR are scarce, which might lead to misjudgment of the clinical relevance of reduced GFR in old age.\nDESIGN, SETTING, PARTICIPANTS, & MEASUREMENTS: To describe the course of eGFR in older adults and derive reference values in population-based individuals, we used the longitudinal design of the Berlin Initiative Study (BIS) with a repeated estimation of GFR over a median of 6.1 years of follow-up. In 2069 community-dwelling older individuals (mean inclusion age 80 years, range 70-99), GFR was estimated biennially with the BIS-2 equation, including standardized creatinine and cystatin C levels, sex, and age. We described the crude and adjusted course using a mixed-effects model and analyzed the influence of death on the GFR course applying joint models. GFR slopes were compared using GFR equations on the basis of creatinine and\/or cystatin C.\nRESULTS: We observed a decreasing, thus nonlinear, eGFR decline with increasing age in a population of old adults. The estimated 1-year slope for ages 75 and 90 diminished for men from -1.67 to -0.99 and for women from -1.52 to -0.97. The modeled mean eGFR for men aged ≥79 and women ≥78 was below 60 ml\/min per 1.73 m. Multivariable adjustment attenuated slopes only minimally. Taking death into account by applying joint models did not alter the nonlinear eGFR decline. Using eGFR equations on the basis of creatinine only showed linear slope patterns in contrast to nonlinear patterns for equations including cystatin C.\nCONCLUSIONS: The eGFR decline depended on sex and age and changed only marginally after multivariable adjustment but decelerated with increasing age. Equations including cystatin C demonstrated a nonlinear slope challenging the previously assumed linearity of the decline of eGFR in old age.",

Discrimination of the risk prediction models was compared with that of models based on estimated glomerular filtration rate (eGFR) alone, urinary albumin-creatinine ratio (ACR) alone, and their combination.\nRESULTS: Risk scores for major kidney-related events and new-onset albuminuria were derived from 7- and 8-variable models, respectively. Baseline eGFR and ACR were dominant although models based on the 2 factors, alone or combined, had less discrimination (P<0.05) than the risk prediction models containing additional variables (risk prediction model C statistics of 0.847 [95% CI, 0.815-0.880] for major kidney-related events, and 0.647 [95% CI, 0.637-0.658] for new-onset albuminuria). Novel risk factors for new-onset albuminuria included Asian ethnicity and greater waist circumference, and for major kidney-related events, less education. The risk prediction models had acceptable calibration for both outcomes (modified Hosmer-Lemeshow test, P=0.9 and P=0.06, respectively).\nLIMITATIONS: The follow-up period was limited to 5 years. Results are applicable to people with type 2 diabetes at risk of vascular disease.\nCONCLUSIONS: Risk scores have been developed for early and late events in diabetic nephropathy. Although eGFR and urinary ACR are important components of the prediction models, the extra variables considered add significantly to discrimination and, in the case of new-onset albuminuria, are required to achieve satisfactory calibration.",

        "Abstract":"UNLABELLED: Renal dysfunction is frequent in liver cirrhosis and is a strong prognostic predictor of orthotopic liver transplantation (OLT) outcome. Therefore, an accurate evaluation of the glomerular filtration rate (GFR) is crucial in pre-OLT patients. However, in these patients plasma creatinine (Pcr) is inaccurate and the place of serum cystatine C (CystC) is still debated. New GFR-predicting equations, based on standardized assays of Pcr and\/or CystC, have been recently recommended in the general population but their performance in cirrhosis patients has been rarely studied. We evaluated the performance of the recently published Chronic Kidney Disease Epidemiology Collaboration equations (CKD-EPI-Pcr, CKD-EPI-CystC, and CKD-EPI-Pcr-CystC) and the more classical ones (4- and 6-variable MDRD and Hoek formulas) in cirrhosis patients referred for renal evaluation before OLT. Inulin clearance was performed in 202 consecutive patients together with the determination of Pcr and CystC with assays traceable to primary reference materials. The performance of the GFR-predicting equations was evaluated according to ascites severity (no, moderate, or refractory) and to hepatic and renal dysfunctions (MELD score  ≤ or >15 and KDOQI stages, respectively). In the whole population, CystC-based equations showed a better performance than Pcr-based ones (lower bias and higher 10% and 30% accuracies). CKD-EPI-CystC equation showed the best performance whatever the ascites severity and in presence of a significant renal dysfunction (GFR <60 mL\/min\/1.73 m(2)).\nCONCLUSION: Pcr-based GFR predicting equations are not reliable in pre-OLT patients even when an IDMS-traceable enzymatic Pcr assay is used. Whenever a CystC-assay traceable to primary reference materials is performed and when a true measurement of GFR is not possible, CystC-based equations, especially CKD-EPI-CystC, may be recommended to evaluate renal function and for KDOQI staging.",

        "Published":"2020-05-05",
        "Abstract":"INTRODUCTION: Drug dosing in patients with acute kidney injury (AKI) is based on the Cockroft-Gault (CG) equation-derived estimated Creatinine clearance (CGeCrCl) for historical reasons due to the lack of a validated method for estimating glomerular filtration rate (GFR) when Cr is rapidly changing. The kinetic equation (kinetic estimated GFR [KeGFR]) estimates GFR for the nonsteady-state Cr level. It is being validated in patient cohorts and could potentially be used for drug dosing when the Cr level is in the nonsteady state.\nOBJECTIVE: The aim of the study was to measure the concordance and the degree of agreement between KeGFR-, CGeCrCl, and MDRD eGFR-based drug dosing categories in patients with nonsteady Cr levels.\nMETHODS: In the pilot study published previously, 80 adult patients with a significant change in Cr level after admission to the acute medical ward were classified as per the Acute Kidney Injury Network (AKIN) criteria and compared to a KeGFR-based criterion. The CG equation and the MDRD equation were applied retrospectively to the same dataset, and the concordance of the eGFR categories between the 3 methods was studied. The 3 eGFR categories (<30, 30-49, and >50 mL\/min) were chosen to reflect the frequently used drug dosing categories in patients with renal impairment.\nRESULTS: The concordance between CGeCRCL and KeGFR for drug dosing categories was only 62%, with 27 (90%) of the 30 discordant subjects falling into a higher eGFR category when KeGFR was used. The agreement between KeGFR and CGeCrCl was also unsatisfactory. There was better concordance (75%), but the agreement was also not satisfactory between MDRD eGFR and KeGFR for the drug dosing categories.\nCONCLUSIONS: In AKI, compared to CGeCrCL, using KeGFR may affect drug dosing significantly by changing the eGFR category. Further studies of KeGFR for drug dosing will need therapeutic drug monitoring and pharmacokinetic studies for validation.",

        "Published":null,
        "Abstract":"Chronic rejection is the most important cause of renal graft dysfunction. Non-immunological mechanisms have been suggested as a probable origin of chronic graft rejection, provoking a decrease in renal mass function, followed by glomerular hyperfiltration in the remnant nephrons, which could cause progressive glomerulosclerosis and functional loss. Early, or preclinical, identification of patients with glomerular hyperfiltration, defined as an increase in glomerular filtration fraction (GFF) and in glomerular capillary pressure (GCP), could prolong graft life. The objective of this study was to evaluate, non-invasively, stable renal graft haemodynamia and early glomerular hyperfiltration. We studied 116 renal transplant patients with stable renal function and five healthy living kidney donors with normal renal function. Glomerular filtration rate (GFR) and effective renal plasma flow (ERPF) were determined using 51Cr-EDTA and o-[131I]iodohippurate, respectively. GFF was obtained from the relation between GFR and ERPF, and GCP from a mathematical model (Hall-Gomez' formula). A simultaneous analysis of renal function was performed. In transplant patients, the GFR and ERPF were significantly lower than in healthy, living, kidney donors (P<0.02). The same trend was observed for GCP (P<0.01), while GFF was not significantly different. Twelve patients (10.3%) had criteria of glomerular hyperfiltration. In patients without criteria of glomerular hyperfiltration, plasma level and clearance of creatinine were 128+\/-33 micromol.l-1 and 56+\/-15 ml.min-1, respectively; and in those patients with glomerular hyperfiltration criteria were 108+\/-18 micromol.l-1 (P=NS) and 83+\/-24 ml.min-1 (P=0.002) respectively. It is concluded that determinations of GFR, ERPF, GFF and GCP allow non-invasive evaluation of renal graft haemodynamia and can be useful in the early detection of glomerular hyperfiltration.",

The aim of this research was to determine the prevalence of MetS and its components and, to study their association with CKD among Moroccan adult population living in an agricultural province.  The study involved 210 adult participants of 18 and over years, of both sexes, sampled from urban and rural areas of Sidi Bennour province in Morocco. Systolic and diastolic blood pressure, weight, height, and waist circumference were measured and body mass index (BMI) was calculated. Blood total cholesterol, triglycerides, glucose, and serum creatinine were determined. Subsequent glomerular filtration rate (GFR) was estimated by the modification of diet in renal disease formula and the CKD was defined by an estimated GFR (eGFR) <60 mL\/min\/1.73 m. The diagnosis of MetS was based on the National Cholesterol Education Program\/Adult Treatment Panel (NCEP ATP III) report.  The mean age of the participants was 54.18 ± 13.45 years, the prevalence of MetS and CKD were 38% and 4.4%, respectively. Abdominal obesity was the strongest risk factor of MetS among the studied population (71%), followed by increased fasting plasma glucose (40.5%), high blood pressure (35.2%), hypercholesterolemia (31.0%), and hypertriglyceridemia (23.8%). The prevalence of these comorbid factors increased with age ( = 0.000), BMI ( = 0.000), and decreased with education level ( = 0.012). The presence of MetS was significantly associated with decreased eGFR ( = 0.022), hence the prevalence of CKD was markedly greater in subjects with MetS than those without.  Our finding indicates that MetS is a serious public health problem in the study population and that its individual components are involved in decreasing the eGFR and the progression of renal dysfunction. The study results support the need of the development of a strategy to control and prevent worsening of the MetS individual components and development of CKD.",

Here, we evaluated whether pegloticase, a recombinant uricase conjugated to polyethylene glycol, which can lead to persistently low serum urate levels (<1 mg\/dL), can modulate BP in subjects with chronic refractory gout. This post hoc analysis used results from two 6-month randomized clinical trials in which subjects were treated with 8 mg pegloticase every 2 or 4 weeks (q2w or q4w) or placebo. Responders in this study were defined as those individuals in whom a persistently low urate level (<6 mg\/dL and usually <1 mg\/dL) was maintained. Serial sitting BP was measured in 173 subjects, and estimated glomerular filtration rate was determined at baseline and after 3 and 6 months. Significant reductions in mean arterial pressure (MAP) from baseline to 6 months were noted in q2w responders ( P=0.0028), whereas reductions in MAP in other groups were not significant. Significant decreases in both systolic and diastolic BP paralleled the change in MAP. Of the 62% of q2w responders exhibiting persistent decreases in MAP, there were no significant differences in baseline age, sex, race, weight, body mass index, history of hypertension, hyperlipidemia, history of coronary artery disease, gout duration, MAP, serum urate, estimated glomerular filtration rate or urinary uric acid\/creatinine ratio compared with those who did not lower MAP. No significant changes in estimated glomerular filtration rate occurred in any of the groups during the study. Responders to biweekly pegloticase who maintained a persistently lower serum urate level throughout the trial experienced significant reductions in both systolic and diastolic BP that were independent of changes in renal function.

Clinical data were collected, and a binary logistic regression model was employed to test the association between potential predictors and eGFR.\nRESULTS: Serum VEGF-B levels evaluated in type 2 diabetes patients compared with healthy controls. In patients with type 2 diabetes, serum VEGF-B level was positively correlated with triglyceride, serum creatinine and cystatin C while negatively correlated with HDL-C and eGFR.

        "Abstract":"The work was devised to compare measurements of glomerular filtration rate (GFR) by technetium-99m-diethylenetriaminepentacetic acid (99mTc-DTPA) renogram to those by creatinine clearance (measured and predicted by Cockroft and Gault) and by inulin clearance. A total number of 65 individuals were enrolled: 15 healthy controls and 50 patients with renal disease. Compared to inulin clearance used as the gold standard, 99mTc-DTPA overestimated at low and underestimated at high GFRs. 99mTc-DTPA measurements were less precise than creatinine clearance except for individuals with GFR >100 ml\/min x 1.73 m2. Measured creatinine clearance had the highest correlation coefficient with inulin clearance, 99mTc-DTPA clearance the lowest. In correlation analyses, 81.5% of the interindividual variability for measured creatinine clearance could be explained by true differences in inulin clearance; this value dropped to 59.1 and 57.4% for predicted creatinine clearance and 99mTc-DTPA, respectively. In patients with GFR <25 ml\/min x 1.73 m2, all 99mTc-DTPA measurements were out of the 95% confidence interval for the inulin measurement. It can be inferred that 99mTc-DTPA clearance from the renogram is less precise than measured and predicted creatinine clearance.",

        "Abstract":"BACKGROUND: Estimated glomerular filtration (eGFR) results based on serum creatinine are frequently inaccurate with differences against measured GFR (mGFR) often attributed to unmeasured non-functional factors, such as muscle mass.\nMETHODS: The influence of muscle mass (measured by dual-energy x-ray absorptiometry, DEXA) on eGFR error (eGFR-mGFR) was evaluated using isotopic mGFR (Tc DTPA plasma clearance) in 137 kidney transplant recipients. Serum creatinine was measured by isotopic-calibrated enzymatic analysis, converted to eGFR using Chronic Kidney Disease EPIdemiology (CKD-EPI) formula, then unindexed from body surface area.\nFINDINGS: Unindexed CKD-EPI eGFR error displayed absent fixed bias but modest proportional bias against reference mGFR. eGFR error correlated with total lean mass by DEXA (=-0·350, <0·001) and appendicular skeletal muscle index (ASMI), a proxy for muscularity (=-0·420, <0·001). eGFR was falsely reduced by -5·9 ± 1·4 mls\/min per 10 kg lean mass. Adipose mass and percentage fat had no effect on error. Muscle-associated error varied with each eGFR formula and influenced all CKD stages. Systemic eGFR error was predicted by ASMI, mGFR, recipient age, and trimethoprim use using multivariable regression. Residual plots demonstrated heteroscedasticity and greater imprecision at higher mGFR levels (<0·001), from increased variance corresponding to higher absolute values and unreliable prediction by serum creatinine of high mGFR. Serum creatinine correlated with ASMI independent of mGFR level ( = 0·416, <0·001). The diagnostic test performance of CKD-EPI eGFR to predict CKD stage 3 (by mGFR) was weakest in cachexia (sensitivity 68·4%) and muscularity (specificity 47·4%, positive predictive value 54·5% for the highest ASMI quartile).\nINTERPRETATION: Serum creatinine and eGFR are imperfect estimates of true renal function, with systemic errors from muscle mass, tubular secretion, and intrinsic proportional bias; and additional inaccuracy at the extremes of renal function and patient muscularity. Cautious interpretation of eGFR results in the context of body habitus and clinical condition is recommended.",

        "Abstract":"BACKGROUND: Two modifications of the MDRD equation [the Mayo Clinic (MC) equation and Rule's refitted (RR) MDRD formula] were proposed to overcome disadvantages of the original MDRD formula to calculate glomerular filtration rate (GFR). Additionally, a correction factor for the original MDRD formula has been introduced to adapt this formula to creatinine values measured by the isotope-dilution mass spectrometry (IDMS) method. Although precise determination of GFR is of central importance in renal transplant recipients, these equations have not been tested in these patients so far.\nMETHODS: Considering the impact of different creatinine calibrations, we analysed the MC equation and the RR-MDRD formula in comparison with the old as well as the re-expressed (IDMS traceable) MDRD equation and the Cockcroft-Gault (C-G) formula in 126 consecutive patients after kidney transplantation with respect to correlation, bias, precision, accuracy and ROC analysis. GFR was determined as technetium-diethylenetriamine pentaacetic acid ((99m)Tc-DTPA-clearance).\nRESULTS: After adjustment to IDMS creatinine determination, the performance of the re-expressed MDRD formula improved considerably in comparison to the original MDRD equation. In comparison with the re-expressed MDRD formula bias of the MC formula and the RR-MDRD formula were significantly smaller (2.31 and -0.35 vs 3.82 ml\/min\/1.73 m(2)). However, precision and correlation of these formulae did not differ significantly from one another, but all equations showed a higher precision than the C-G formula (P < or = 0.006 each). The accuracies within 30% of true GFR of the MC (79.4%) and the RR-MDRD equation (84.9%) were significantly higher than those of the re-expressed MDRD formula (72.2%; P < 0.03).\nCONCLUSION: In comparison to the original and the re-expressed MDRD formula, calculation of GFR by the MC equation and the RR-MDRD formula led to improved diagnostic performance in renal transplant recipients after adjustment of creatinine. In quotidian work both formulae can be applied to these patients. Nonetheless, to determine GFR exactly, gold standard techniques are mandatory.",

Objective The study investigated whether a 240 mg once daily standard dose achieves the recommended target serum gentamicin concentrations. Setting The prospective, observational study took place in the 2 major public hospitals in Namibia. Method Twenty-nine female patients receiving a standard dose (240 mg gentamicin once daily) participated in the study. Two blood samples were withdrawn to estimate gentamicin pharmacokinetic parameters. Serum creatinine was used to calculate creatinine clearance with the Cockcroft-Gault formula (CL), and estimate glomerular filtration rate (eGFR) by the Modified Diet in Renal Disease (MDRD) and Chronic Kidney Disease Epidemiology Collaboration (CKD-EPI) equations. Main outcome measure The outcome measure was the proportion of patients receiving 240 mg gentamicin once daily having C values above 15 mg\/L. Results Total body weight (TBW) and body mass index were highly variable: 43-115 kg, and 17.3-41.3 kg\/m, respectively. The gentamicin dose normalized for TBW (adjusted body weight for obese patients) was relatively low, i.e. 4.2 ± 0.8 mg\/kg (mean SD). Gentamicin C was 14.4 ± 4.7 mg\/L; only 9 patients (31%) had a C > 15 g\/mL. eGFR (MDRD-4) correlated well with CL, but eGFR (EPI-CKD) formula showed systematic deviations from CLcr. Conclusions (1) a standard 240 mg dose results in gentamicin C values below 15 mg\/L in the majority of the patients, (2) eGFR formulas to estimate kidney function will have to be evaluated for their usefulness in the Namibian patient population.",

        "Abstract":"Current guidelines recommend reporting eGFR using the Chronic Kidney Disease Epidemiology Collaboration (CKD-EPI) equations unless other equations are more accurate, and recommend the combination of creatinine and cystatin C (eGFRcr-cys) as more accurate than either eGFRcr or eGFRcys alone. However, preferred equations and filtration markers in elderly individuals are debated. In 805 adults enrolled in the community-based Age, Gene\/Environment Susceptibility (AGES)-Reykjavik Study, we measured GFR (mGFR) using plasma clearance of iohexol, standardized creatinine and cystatin C, and eGFR using the CKD-EPI, Japanese, Berlin Initiative Study (BIS), and Caucasian and Asian pediatric and adult subjects (CAPA) equations. We evaluated equation performance using bias, precision, and two measures of accuracy. We first compared the Japanese, BIS, and CAPA equations with the CKD-EPI equations to determine the preferred equations, and then compared eGFRcr and eGFRcys with eGFRcr-cys using the preferred equations. Mean (SD) age was 80.3 (4.0) years. Median (25th, 75th) mGFR was 64 (52, 73) ml\/min per 1.73 m(2), and the prevalence of decreased GFR was 39% (95% confidence interval, 35.8 to 42.5). Among 24 comparisons with the other equations, CKD-EPI equations performed better in 9, similar in 13, and worse in 2. Using the CKD-EPI equations, eGFRcr-cys performed better than eGFRcr in four metrics, better than eGFRcys in two metrics, and similar to eGFRcys in two metrics. In conclusion, neither the Japanese, BIS, nor CAPA equations were superior to the CKD-EPI equations in this cohort of community-dwelling elderly individuals.

The GFR was measured using 51 Cr-EDTA clearance and endogenous Ccr. The Ccr was also estimated by four formulae. In healthy subjects Ccr calculated by the formulae of Cockcroft and Gault and Hull et al gave higher correlation coefficient (0.710 and 0.714 respectively) with endogenous Ccr than the formulae of Gates and that of Jellife (0.514 and 0.586 respectively). When all the subjects with a wide range of GFR (3.5-145 mls\/min) were considered all the four formulae gave reasonable correlation, but the formula of Cockcroft and Gault was the best.

        "Abstract":"OBJECTIVE: Renal dysfunction predicts an increased risk of both early and long-term mortality after cardiac surgery. Cystatin C enables glomerular filtration rate (GFR) to be estimated accurately and may be superior in this regard to creatinine-based estimates. We hypothesised, therefore, that cystatin C and derived estimates of GFR would independently predict long-term survival after cardiac surgery and would be superior in this respect to traditional estimates of GFR. The current study tests this hypothesis in a large and well-characterised cohort of patients.\nDESIGN: A prospective cohort study.\nSETTING: Regional cardiothoracic centre in Northeast Scotland.\nPARTICIPANTS: 1010 patients undergoing non-emergent cardiac surgery between 2004 and 2007. Serum creatinine and cystatin C levels were measured preoperatively and demographic and clinical variables were recorded.\nPRIMARY OUTCOME MEASURE: All-cause mortality, established from the National Records of Scotland.\nRESULTS: The median duration of follow-up after surgery was 9.7 years (IQR 8.9-10.6 years), during which 297 participants died. Preoperative creatinine and cystatin C levels and estimates of GFR derived from these were all strong predictors of death using Cox regression and remained independently predictive after adjustment for the logistic European System for Cardiac Operative Risk Evaluation, a well-validated clinical risk score and a range of other clinical predictors. Cystatin C-based measures were superior to creatinine-based estimates of GFR.\nCONCLUSIONS: Cystatin C and creatinine derived eGFR are powerful and independent predictors of long-term mortality following cardiac surgery. Estimates of GFR derived from cystatin C convey superior prognostic information to conventional creatinine-based estimates, but the observed differences are modest.",

This cross-sectional study aimed to assess acute kidney injury biomarkers, and cross-shift change among 150 sugarcane cutters and 98 sugarcane farmers in Thailand. Physical health examination, environmental measurements, and measured urinary neutrophil gelatinase-associated lipocalin (NGAL) were assessed. Cross-shift change of urine creatinine (uCr), albumin creatinine ratio (ACR), and NGAL between sugarcane farmers and cutters was compared. Factors influencing abnormal post-shift ACR and NGAL were analyzed by binary logistic regression adjusted with covariates. Sugarcane cutters were significantly more likely to take nonsteroidal anti-inflammatory drugs (NSAID) and herbs to relieve pain than sugarcane farmers. Males were more likely to be current smokers and drinkers although 62% of cutters and 56% of farmers were female. Sugarcane farmers and cutters had similar post-shift estimated glomerular filtration rate (eGFR) and ACR levels. Cross-shift measurements showed that both sugarcane cutters and sugarcane farmers had significantly higher post-shift geometric mean (GM) urinary NGAL, but that the cross-shift changes of NGAL were significantly higher for sugarcane cutters (182%) vs. sugarcane farmers (112%). Water intake less than recommendation of subjects was a significant predictor of a higher risk for an abnormal post-shift ACR after controlling for covariates, while being a sugarcane cutter was a predictor of a lower risk of an abnormal risk of a post-shift NGAL after controlling for covariates. Measurements of heat stress (WBGT plus workload) found that sugarcane cutters exceeded recommended exposures while sugarcane farmers were compliance to the TLV. These findings suggest that to protect sugarcane farmers and cutters, preventative measures are needed.",

Thirty patients with chronic hepatitis B (CHB) and 30 healthy controls in the same study period were also included. Measurement of serum cystatin C (CysC) was performed by a particle-enhanced immunonephelometry assay using the BN Prospec nephelometer system. The ACLF patients were followed during their hospitalization period.\nRESULTS: In the ACLF group, serum level of CysC was 1.1 ± 0.4 mg\/L, which was significantly higher (P < 0.01) than those in the healthy controls (0.6 ± 0.3 mg\/L) and CHB patients (0.7 ± 0.2 mg\/L). During the hospitalization period, eight ACLF patients developed AKI. Logistic regression analysis indicated that CysC level was an independent risk factor for AKI development (odds ratio = 1.8; 95%CI: 1.4-2.3, P = 0.021). The cutoff value of serum CysC for prediction of AKI in ACLF patients was 1.21 mg\/L. The baseline CysC-based estimated glomerular filtration rate (eGFR(CysC)) was significantly lower than the creatinine-based eGFR (eGFR(CG) and eGFR(MDRD)) in ACLF patients with AKI, suggesting that baseline eGFR(CysC) represented early renal function in ACLF patients while the Cr levels were still within the normal ranges.\nCONCLUSION: Serum CysC provides early prediction of renal dysfunction in ACLF patients with a normal serum Cr level.",

        "Abstract":"INTRODUCTION: A recent report by the CKD-EPI Chronic Kidney Disease Epidemiology Collaboration) group describes a new equation to estimate the glomerular filtration rate (GFR). This equation has been developed from a population of 8,254 subjects who had the GFR measured by iothalamate clearance (mean 68 mL\/min\/1.73 m2, SD 40 mL\/min\/1.73 m2). It includes variables such as serum creatinine, age, sex and race with different formula according to race, sex and creatinine value. The CKD-EPI equation improved the accuracy and precision results of the current first-choice MDRD-IDMS (Modification of Diet in Renal Disease-Isotopic Dilution Mass Spectrometry) formula, specially for GFR > 60 mL\/min\/1.73 m2 in a group of 3,896 subjects.\nMETHODS: The goal of our study was to compare the estimated GFR by using the new equation CKD-EPI with MDRD-IDMS in a wide cohort of 14,427 patients (5,234 women and 9,193 men), and to analyze the impact of the new CKD-EPI formula on the staging of patients with CKD.\nRESULTS: Mean estimated GFR was 0.6 mL\/min\/1.73 m2 higher with CKD-EPI as compared to MDRD-IDMS for the whole group, 1.9 mL\/min\/1.73 m2 higher for women and 0.2 mL\/min\/1.73 m2 lower for men. The percentage of CKD staging concordancy between equations varied from 79.4 % for stage 3A and 98.6% for stage 5. For those patients younger than 70 years, 18.9 % and 24 % MDRD-IDMS stages 3B and 3A were reclassified as CKD 3A and 2 by CKD-EPI, respectively. For the same stages in the group younger than 70 years, the percentage of reclassified patients increased up to 34.4% and 33.4%, respectively.\nCONCLUSION: The new CKD-EPI equation to estimate the GFR reclassifies an important number of patients to higher CKD stages (higher GFR), specially younger women, classified as CKD stage 3 by MDRD-IDMS.",

        "Abstract":"Cystatin C may be a more accurate marker of the glomerular filtration rate (GFR) than creatinine. We evaluated the performance of the creatinine-based abbreviated modification of diet in renal disease (MDRD), the Chronic Kidney Disease Epidemiology Collaboration (CKD-EPI) equations, and 6 cystatin C-based equations in estimating GFR (eGFR) in a heterogeneous sample of patients. Measured GFR (mGFR) was obtained from the plasma clearance of 99mtechnetium Diethylenetriaminepentaacetic acid in 42 adult patients referred for nuclear GFR testing (January to March 2008). We evaluated the bias, precision, and accuracy of the abbreviated MDRD, CKD-EPI, Filler, Grubb, Hoek, Larsson, Le Bricon, and Rule eGFR equations. Participants had a mean mGFR of 70.9 mL\/min\/1.73 m2 (range: 22-125 mL\/min\/1.73 m2), a median age of 57 years (interquartile range: 45, 66), were 62% male, and were 38% liver transplant recipients. Correlation coefficients between eGFRs and mGFR ranged from 0.65 to 0.87 (each P<0.001). The cystatin C-based Hoek equation had the best overall performance with a low bias (-1.4 mL\/min\/1.73 m2), good precision (13.3 mL\/min\/1.73 m2), and greatest accuracy, with 93% of values within 30% of mGFR. Although the CKD-EPI equation had the lowest bias (-0.6 mL\/min\/1.73 m2), it had poor precision (20.7 mL\/min\/1.73 m2) and low accuracy, with only 69% of values within 30% of mGFR. The Hoek equation remained accurate and had the least bias when patients were grouped according to the history of liver transplantation and the mGFR above or below 60 mL\/min\/1.73 m2. In this heterogeneous sample, the cystatin C-based Hoek equation performed the best overall, regardless of mGFR level or history of liver transplantation.",

        "Abstract":"BACKGROUND: The glomerular filtration rate (GFR) is the most important measure of kidney function and chronic kidney disease (CKD). This study aims to validate commonly used equations for estimated GFR (eGFR) based on creatinine (cr), cystatin C (cys), β-trace protein (BTP), and β2-microglobulin (B2M) in older adults.\nMETHOD: We conducted a validation study with 126 participants aged between 72 and 98 with a mean measured GFR (mGFR) by iohexol clearance of 54 mL\/min\/1.73 m2. The eGFR equations (CKD-Epidemiology collaboration [CKD-EPI], Berlin Initiative Study [BIS], Full Age Spectrum [FAS], Modification of Diet in Renal Disease [MDRD]cr, Caucasian-Asian-Pediatric-Adult [CAPA]cys, Lund-Malmö Revised [LM-REV]cr, and MEAN-LM-CAPAcr-cys), were assessed in terms of bias (median difference: eGFR-mGFR), precision (interquartile range of the differences), and accuracy (P30: percentage of estimates ±30% of mGFR). The equations were compared to a benchmark equation: CKD-EPIcr-cys.\nRESULTS: All cystatin C-based equations underestimated the GFR compared to mGFR, whereas bias was mixed for the equations based only on creatinine. Accuracy was the highest for CKD-EPIcr-cys (98%) and lowest for MDRD (82%). Below mGFR 45 mL\/min\/1.73 m2 only equations incorporating cystatin C reached P30 accuracy >90%. CKD-EPIcr-cys was not significantly more accurate than the other cystatin C-based equations. In contrast, CKD-EPIcr-cys was significantly more accurate than all creatinine-based equations except LM-REVcr.\nCONCLUSION: This study confirms that it is reasonable to use equations incorporating cystatin C and creatinine in older patients across a wide spectrum of GFR. However, the results call into question the use of creatinine alone below mGFR 45 mL\/min\/1.73 m2. B2M and BTP do not demonstrate additional value in eGFR determination in older adults.",

        "Abstract":"Chronic kidney disease risk factors may associate with the estimated glomerular filtration rate (eGFR) differently than with the measured GFR. To examine this, we evaluated 1150 patients (mean age 65 years) in two community cohorts for risk factors, measured GFR by iothalamate clearance, and eGFR based on creatinine (Cr), cystatin C (CysC), or both. The interaction between each risk factor and eGFR (relative to measured GFR) identified risk factor associations with eGFR along non-GFR pathways. In a subset of 40 patients with two visits, the mean coefficient of variation was 8.2% for measured GFR, 6.4% for eGFRCr, 8.2% for eGFRCr-CysC, and 10.7% for eGFRCysC. The measured GFR was better correlated with eGFRCr-CysC (r, 0.74) than eGFRCr (r, 0.70) or eGFRCysC (r, 0.68). Lower measured GFR associated with lower 24-hour urine creatinine, albuminuria, hypertension, diabetes, higher triglycerides, and higher uric acid. Lower eGFRCr had these same associations except for an association with higher 24-hour urine creatinine along a non-GFR pathway. Lower eGFRCysC and eGFRCr-CysC also had these same associations but also associated with obesity, albuminuria, hypertension, diabetes, higher triglycerides, higher C-reactive protein, and higher uric acid along non-GFR pathways. Thus, cystatin C improves estimation of GFR over creatinine alone; however, the association between most of the risk factors and GFR was more accurate by eGFR based on creatinine alone. This is explained by the association of these risk factors with the non-GFR determinants of cystatin C.",

However, epidemiological data investigating the relationship between HDL-C levels and kidney function in the general population with roughly normal kidney function are limited, and the results are also inconsistent. The aim of this study was to evaluate the relationship between HDL-C levels and the estimated glomerular filtration rate (eGFR) in a community-based population in China.\nMETHODS: This was a community-based cross-sectional survey. In total, 4925 participants (age range, 18-96 years; mean, 51.30±11.98 years) were recruited during routine health status examinations. A questionnaire was used to ascertain age, smoking status, and the history of hypertension and diabetes mellitus for each participant. We measured the body mass index, waist circumference, systolic and diastolic blood pressure, and fasting glucose, total cholesterol, triglyceride, HDL-C, low-density lipoprotein cholesterol, uric acid, and serum creatinine level of each participant. eGFR was evaluated using the Chinese modified Modification of Diet in Renal Disease equation.\nRESULTS: The HDL-C level was higher in the first quartile (lowest quartile) of eGFR than in the fourth quartile (the highest quartile). Additionally, HDL-C levels decreased as eGFR decreased. Pearson's correlation analysis revealed that HDL-C levels were associated with eGFR (r=0.16). After adjustment for some confounders, HDL-C was independently associated with all quartiles of eGFR in the participants.\nCONCLUSIONS: HDL-C was independently associated with kidney function in a community-dwelling general population.

        "Abstract":"BACKGROUND: Assessing the glomerular filtration rate (GFR) of paediatric patients receiving nephrotoxic chemotherapy is a vital element of clinical practice. Isotopically measured GFR is the gold standard in terms of accuracy but requires injection of tracer followed by several hours of blood tests. Estimation of GFR using creatinine is widely used but inaccurate, and there is increasing concern regarding its usage for paediatric oncology patients. Cystatin C (CysC) based equations are increasingly used in other paediatric specialities to estimate GFR, and their usefulness in paediatric oncology practice is becoming evident.\nMETHODS: We assessed the renal function of children with solid tumours and CNS tumours receiving nephrotoxic chemotherapy over a 1-year period using paired CysC and isotopic GFR.\nRESULTS: Fifty-six sets of measurements were reviewed with estimated GFR predicted using CysC-based and creatinine-based equations. The best performing equation was the 'new CKiD' equation, which estimated GFR within 30% of the measured GFR on 86% of occasions, outperforming the Schwartz equation. If estimated GFR using this equation was >100 ml\/min\/1.73 m(2) , all values of measured GFR were normal at >90 ml\/min\/1.73 m(2) , a category containing two-thirds of all measurements.\nCONCLUSIONS: The new CKiD equation predicts GFR in paediatric oncology patients with more accuracy than creatinine-based equations.

Hypertensive subjects, older than 55 years, were included. In all of them a structured interview including cardiovascular risk factors or disease was performed. Blood pressure was measured following a standard procedure, and serum biochemistry and an electrocardiogram were obtained. Renal function was estimated using the abbreviated MDRD (Modification of Diet in Renal Disease Study Group) equation. For each glomerular filtration rate stratum the odds ratio and 95% confidence interval (CI) of left ventricular hypertrophy or cardiovascular disease were calculated, adjusted by confounding variables.\nRESULTS: A total of 13 687 patients (mean age 68.1 years, women 55.4%, diabetics 30.6%, body mass index 28.6 kg\/m2) were included. Of these, 26.4% had established cardiovascular diseases and 20.3% electrocardiographic left ventricular hypertrophy. The average serum creatinine was 1.01 mg\/dl, creatinine clearance 70.0 ml\/min, and glomerular filtration rate 74.0 ml\/min per 1.73 m2. Thirty-three patients (0.24%) had glomerular filtration rate < 5 ml\/min per 1.73 m2; 89 (0.65%) from 15 to 29; 3745 (27.36%) from 30 to 59; 7798 (56.97%) from 60 to 89; and 2019 (14.75%) higher than 89 ml\/min per 1.73 m2. In a multiple regression analysis, after adjusting by age, sex, body mass index, diabetes, systolic and diastolic blood pressure, and smoking, a lower glomerular filtration rate was associated with a higher prevalence of left ventricular hypertrophy. Likewise, a reduction in the glomerular filtration rate was also associated with a higher prevalence of cardiovascular disease.\nCONCLUSIONS: In hypertensive patients from primary care, the prevalence of cardiovascular disease is inversely proportional to the level of renal function. Estimated glomerular filtration is easy to determine and complements evaluation of the hypertensive patient.",

The BIS equations confirmed a high prevalence of persons older than 70 years with a GFR less than 60 mL\/min per 1.73 m2 (BIS1, 50.4%; BIS2, 47.4%; measured GFR, 47.9%). The total misclassification rate for this criterion was smallest for the BIS2 equation (11.6%), followed by the cystatin C equation 2 (15.1%) proposed by the Chronic Kidney Disease Epidemiology Collaboration. Among the creatinine-based equations, BIS1 had the smallest misclassification rate (17.2%), followed by the Chronic Kidney Disease Epidemiology Collaboration equation (20.4%).\nLIMITATION: There was no validation by an external data set.\nCONCLUSION: The BIS2 equation should be used to estimate GFR in persons aged 70 years or older with normal or mild to moderately reduced kidney function. If cystatin C is not available, the BIS1 equation is an acceptable alternative.\nPRIMARY FUNDING SOURCE: Kuratorium für Dialyse und Nierentransplatation (KfH) Foundation of Preventive Medicine.",

        "Abstract":"Proteinuria helps to establish the diagnosis of most renal diseases and also to predict the outcome of such diseases. Proteinuria is biochemically represented by measuring the protein concentration in timed collection of 24 hour urine. But, 24-hour timed urine collection is time consuming, cumbersome and often unreliable due to collection errors and also results in undue delay on diagnostic process. An alternate approach avoiding arduous and inaccurate timed urine collection can be the measurement of protein creatinine ratio in spot morning urine. This study was aimed to evaluate whether the spot morning urine protein creatinine ratio can be a reliable alternative to 24-hour urinary total protein (UTP) estimation. The study was carried out in the department of Biochemistry, Bangabandhu Sheikh Mujib Medical University, Dhaka on 50 (fifty) non-diabetic Chronic Renal Disease (CRD) patients with an age ranging from 18 -70 years. The study subjects were grouped into mild, moderate and severe CRD on the basis of GFR. Urinary protein and creatinine concentrations were measured in spot morning urine samples and their ratios were calculated. Urinary protein measured in 24-hour timed collected urine samples gave the 24-hour UTP excretion rate. In our study, spot morning urine protein creatinine ratio significantly correlated with 24-hour UTP excretion rate in all CRD patients. Severe CRD patients gave significant positive correlation (p<0.05), whereas mild and moderate CRD patients gave very highly significant positive correlation (p<0.001). Therefore, it may be suggested that protein creatinine ratio in spot morning urine can be accepted as a reliable and alternative to 24-hour UTP excretion rate in non-diabetic chronic renal disease patients. This simple and inexpensive procedure will thus simplify the way of establishing the severity of renal disease along with its prognosis.",

        "Abstract":"CONTEXT AND OBJECTIVE: In the estimation of glomerular filtration rate (GFR), ethnicity is an important determinant. However, all existing equations have been built solely from Caucasian and Afro-American populations and they are potentially inaccurate for estimating GFR in African populations. We therefore evaluated the performance of different estimated GFR (eGFR) equations in predicting measured GFR (mGFR).\nMETHODS: In a cross-sectional study, 93 healthy adults were randomly selected in the general population of Kinshasa, Democratic Republic of the Congo, between June 2015 and April 2016. We compared mGFR by plasma clearance of iohexol with eGFR obtained with the Modified Diet in Renal Disease (MDRD) equation with and without ethnic factor, the Chronic Kidney Disease Epidemiology (CKD-EPI) serum creatinine (SCr)-based equation, with and without ethnic factor, the cystatin C-based CKD-EPI equation (CKD-EPI SCys) and with the combined equation (CKD-EPI SCrCys) with and without ethnic factor. The performance of the equations was studied by calculating bias, precision and accuracy within 30% (P30) of mGFR.\nRESULTS: There were 48 women and 45 men. Their mean age was 45.0±15.7 years and the average body surface area was 1.68±0.16m2. Mean mGFR was 92.0±17.2 mL\/min\/1.73m2 (range of 57 to 141 mL\/min\/1.73m2). Mean eGFRs with the different equations were 105.5±30.1 and 87.2±24.8 mL\/min\/1.73m2 for MDRD with and without ethnic factor, respectively; 108.8±24.1 and 94.3x20.9 mL\/min\/1.73m2 for CKD-EPI SCr with and without ethnic factor, respectively, 93.5±18.6 mL\/min\/1.73m2 for CKD-EPI SCys; 93.5±18.0 and 101±19.6 mL\/min\/ 1.73m2 for CKD-EPI SCrCys with and without ethnic factor, respectively. All equations slightly overestimated mGFR except MDRD without ethnic factor which underestimated by -3.8±23.0 mL\/min \/1.73m2. Both CKD-EPI SCr and MDRD with ethnic factors highly overestimated mGFR with a bias of 17.9±19.2 and 14.5±27.1 mL\/min\/1.73m2, respectively. There was a trend for better P30 for MDRD and CKD-EPI SCr without than with the ethnic factor [86.0% versus 79.6% for MDRD (p = 0.21) and 81.7% versus 73.1% for the CKD-EPI SCr equations (p = 0.057)]. CKD-EPI SCrCys and CKD-EPI SCys were more effective than creatinine-based equations.\nCONCLUSION: In the Congolese healthy population, MDRD and CKD-EPI equations without ethnic factors had better performance than the same equations with ethnic factor. The equations using Cys C (alone or combined with SCr) performed better than the creatinine-based equations.",

        "Abstract":"Cockcroft-Gault (CG) and Modification of Diet in Renal Disease (MDRD) formula are indirect estimates of renal function which have been widely accepted, though their accuracies have been scarcely validated in advanced chronic renal failure. The purpose of this study was to determine the accuracy (bias and precision) of these formulas in advanced CRF patients. The study group consisted of 99 unselected patients (62 +\/- 15 years, 59 females) with advanced CRF. The glomerular filtration rate (GFR) was measured by Tc(99m) DTPA. Simultaneously, estimates of GFR by CG corrected for 1.73 m2 and MDRD (formula 7) were calculated. Agreement was evaluated graphically, bias was assessed by mean and median difference, and precision by median absolute differences and Bland-Altman plots. Mean GFR by DTPA, CG and MDRD were: 16.24 +\/- 4.38 and 16.77 +\/- 4.65 and 13.58 +\/- 4.27 ml\/min\/1.73 m2, respectively. MDRD equation significantly underestimated GFR-DTPA (p = 0.0001). Both CG and MDRD correlated significantly with GFR-DTPA (R = 0.53 and R = 0.62, respectively). CG formula performed better than the MDRD equation with respect to bias (0.30 vs -3.24 ml\/min\/1.73 m2, p = 0.0001), and precision (0.58 vs. -3.11 ml\/min\/1.73 m2, p = 0.0001). By multiple linear regression, the best determinants of the error of the estimation by CC formula were: serum creatinine (beta = -0.58; p < 0.0001), age (beta = -0.62; p < 0.0001), and body mass index (beta = 0.26, p = 0.004), and by MDRD formula were: serum creatinine (beta = -0.38; p < 0.0001), and body mass index (beta = -0.20, p = 0.03). In conclusion, in unselected patients with advanced chronic renal failure, estimates by CC formula were more accurate than those obtained by MDRD formula. Serum creatinine was the main source of error of the estimation of GFR by both formulas, though demographic and anthropometric characteristics influenced as well on their accuracies.",

In this work, we examine the extent to which the addition of serum cystatin C improves glomerular filtration rate (GFR) estimation and mortality prediction, in comparison to various GFR-estimating equations.\nMETHODS: The GFR was measured in LT recipients by iothalamate clearance. Concurrent serum cystatin C was assayed in banked serum samples. Performance of GFR-estimating equations with and without cystatin C, including the modification of diet in renal disease and CKD-epidemiology collaboration formulas was assessed. The proportional hazards regression analysis was performed to determine the association between serum cystatin C and mortality.\nRESULTS: A total of 586 iothalamate results were obtained in 401 patients after a mean of 4 years after LT. When compared to measured GFR, the formula with both creatinine and cystatin C, namely, CKD-epidemiology cr-cys, outperformed those with either marker alone. Performance of creatinine-based models was similar to one another. Serum cystatin C, by itself or as a part of an estimated GFR, was a significant predictor of mortality.\nCONCLUSIONS: Serum cystatin C has an important role in enhancing accuracy of GFR estimation and predicting mortality in LT recipients.",

        "Abstract":"['3', '2']\nEnvironmental pollution is a risk factor for kidney dysfunction. However, the combined toxicity of air pollutants on kidney function is scarce. We estimated the relationship between combined toxicity of air pollutants and kidney function among adult women (n = 7071, 18-65 years old) in Mianyang City, Southwest China. We measured serum concentrations of uric acid, urea, creatinine, and cystatin C, and we calculated the individual estimated glomerular filtration rate (eGFR) using a cystatin C-based equation developed specifically for Chinese patients with CKD equation. Air pollution data were collected to calculate the individual average daily dose (ADD) of pollutants based on the air quality complex index (AQCI). Mean AQCI was higher in winter and lower in summer, and followed the monthly and seasonal trends of air pollutants. Concomitantly, individual ADD was also higher in winter and lower in summer, and the seasonal differences were reflected in the levels of kidney biomarkers (including uric acid, urea, creatinine, cystatin C, and eGFR). With an interquartile range (IQR: 1.04-1.50 m\/day\/kg) increases of ADD, the serum concentrations of uric acid, urea, creatinine, and cystatin C increase [B (95%CI): 1.774 (0.318, 3.231) umol\/L, 0.218 (0.1888, 0.247) mmol\/L, 1.501 (1.016, 1.986) umol\/L, and 0.006 (0.003, 0.009) mg\/L, respectively], whereas eGFR decreases [B (95%CI): -0.776 (-1.106, -0.446) mL\/min\/1.73 m]. Totally, the relationship between combined toxicity of air pollutants and kidney function in Chinese adult women suggests that the toxicity of combined air pollutants inversely affects kidney function, which might accelerate the risk of CKD.",

The CKD-EPI equations overestimated mGFR with a larger median bias for eGFRcr and eGFRcr-cys than eGFRcys [-8.3 (95% confidence interval -9.7, -6.5), -7.8 (-9.2, -6.2) and -3.7 (-5.0, -1.8) mL\/min\/1.73 m2, respectively], with smaller bias for those with lower compared with higher eGFR and by race compared with sex.\nCONCLUSION: The small differential bias of the CKD-EPI equation between races suggests that they can be used in Blacks as well as Whites in older community-based adults. The large differential bias in women versus men in all equations is in contrast to other studies and is unexplained.

This study examined the acute effect of DFT testing on renal function in patients undergoing implantable cardioverter defibrillator (ICD) implantation.\nMETHODS AND RESULTS: We performed a prospective cohort study of 148 consecutive patients who underwent ICD implantation from January 1, 2007 to May 30, 2008. Patients were assigned to one of two cohorts: a DFT group who underwent DFT testing at device implantation and a no-DFT group that was not tested. Baseline and 24-h postprocedure renal function were assessed with measurements of serum creatinine and estimated glomerular filtration rate (GFR) by the Modified Diet in Renal Disease equation. Changes in serum creatinine and estimated GFR were compared between cohorts. Ninety-eight patients (66%) underwent DFT testing (average VF induction count, 1.5 ± 0.9; mean VF duration, 10 ± 4 s). Fifty patients (34%) were not tested. Patients in the no-DFT group had lower mean left ventricular ejection fraction, higher New York Heart Association class, higher atrial fibrillation incidence, and greater intravenous contrast utilization at device implant. Baseline and postprocedure serum creatinine values were similar between groups (baseline, 1.25 ± 0.45 mg\/dL; post-ICD, 1.26 ± 0.5 mg\/dL). Baseline GFR was lower in the DFT cohort (55.2 ± 18.8 mL\/min\/BSA vs 63.7 ± 22.7 mL\/min\/BSA, p = 0.023).

        "Abstract":"BACKGROUND: Renal failure after thoracoabdominal aortic repair is a significant clinical problem. Distal aortic perfusion for organ and spinal cord protection requires cannulation of the left femoral artery. In 2006, we reported the finding that direct cannulation led to leg ischemia in some patients and was associated with increased renal failure. After this finding, we modified our perfusion technique to eliminate leg ischemia from cannulation. In this article, we present the effects of this change on postoperative renal function.\nMETHODS: Between February 1991 and July 2008, we repaired 1464 thoracoabdominal aortic aneurysms. Distal aortic perfusion was used in 1088, and these were studied. Median patient age was 68 years, and 378 (35%) were women. In September 2006, we began to adopt a sidearm femoral cannulation technique that provides distal aortic perfusion while maintaining downstream flow to the leg. This was used in 167 patients (15%). We measured the joint effects of preoperative glomerular filtration rate (GFR) and cannulation technique on the highest postoperative creatinine level, postoperative renal failure, and death. Analysis was by multiple linear or logistic regression with interaction.\nRESULTS: The preoperative GFR was the strongest predictor of postoperative renal dysfunction and death. No significant main effects of sidearm cannulation were noted. For peak creatinine level and postoperative renal failure, however, strong interactions between preoperative GFR and sidearm cannulation were present, resulting in reductions of postoperative renal complications of 15% to 20% when GFR was <60 mL\/min\/1.73 m(2). For normal GFR, the effect was negated or even reversed at very high levels of GFR. Mortality, although not significantly affected by sidearm cannulation, showed a similar trend to the renal outcomes.\nCONCLUSION: Use of sidearm cannulation is associated with a clinically important and highly statistically significant reduction in postoperative renal complications in patients with a low GFR. Reduced renal effect of skeletal muscle ischemia is the proposed mechanism. Effects among patients with good preoperative renal function are less clear. A randomized trial is needed.",

        "Abstract":"BACKGROUND: Diabetes is one of the risks for development of contrast-induced nephropathy (CIN). The percentage change in cystatin C (CyC), a recent new reliable marker for detecting subtle renal dysfunction, of ≥10% for 24h after procedure is an independent predictor for developing CIN. Urinary microalbumin is one of the markers for preclinical nephropathy in diabetic patients. We investigated the relationship between pre-procedural urinary microalbumin and renal functional changes using CyC after coronary computed tomography angiography (CCTA) in diabetic patients.\nMETHODS: Two hundred and six patients with diabetes scheduled for CCTA were enrolled. The serum creatinine and CyC levels were measured before and 24h after CCTA. The percentage change in CyC (%CyC) and absolute change in estimated glomerular filtration rate (eGFR) from pre- to post-procedure were calculated. The pre-procedural urinary microalbumin was measured. The patients were classified into 2 groups as follows: group A comprised 93 patients with pre-procedural urinary microalbumin of ≥30mg\/g creatinine; and group B comprised 113 patients with one of <30mg\/g creatinine.\nRESULTS: The %CyC, fasting plasma glucose levels, and HbA1c were significantly greater in group A than in group B. The absolute change in eGFR was significantly less in group A than in group B. A significant correlation was seen between urinary microalbumin and %CyC (r=0.49, p<0.0001). Multivariate regression analysis revealed that pre-procedural urinary microalbumin and HbA1c were independent predictors for a %CyC≥10% (OR: 1.030, 95% CI: 1.020-1.039, p=0.008; and OR: 1.011, 95% CI: 1.007-1.016, p=0.004, respectively). The optimal cut-off value of a pre-procedural urinary microalbumin level was 64mg\/g creatinine for predicting a %CyC≥10% using receiver-operating characteristic curve analysis with a sensitivity, specificity, and area under the curve of 56%, 88%, and 0.72, respectively.\nCONCLUSIONS: Renal functional changes should be paid attention to after CCTA, particularly in diabetic patients exhibiting elevated pre-procedural urinary microalbumin even though they indicate preserved eGFR.",

Screening was conducted by participant questionnaire including risk factors, physical measurements (weight, height, blood pressure and body mass index), and a single first-morning urine sample to determine the presence of vascular-renal damage markers – proteinuria and hematuria (Combur 10 Test, Roche), and microalbuminuria (Micral Test, Roche). When results were positive, serum creatinine was determined and glomerular filtration rate (GFR) estimated with Modification of Diet in Renal Disease (MDRD) formula for adults and Schwartz formula for children <15 years. Data obtained were analyzed to determine association of participants’ nutritional status with prevalence of chronic kidney disease, hypertension and diabetes mellitus, as well as a set of common risk factors.\nRESULTS: Population <20 years: Obesity prevalence 3.2%; positive urine markers in 56.9% of obese and 8.9% of non-obese participants; positive albuminuria in 38% of obese and 3% of non-obese. Obese participants were found to be hyperfiltrating. DM prevalence was 9.5% in obese and 1.1% in non-obese participants. Population ≥20 years: Overweight, 31.3%; obese, 13.4%. Positive markers in normal-weight, overweight and obese individuals were 18.3%, 21.2% and 32.7%, respectively; microalbuminuria values increased with weight. Obese individuals were found to be hyperfiltrating. HTN prevalence in normal-weight, overweight and obese individuals was 18.3%, 31.5%, and 51.0% respectively; DM rates were 2.8%, 5.2% y 11.3%, respectively.\nCONCLUSION: In Cuba, obesity poses significant risk for vascular and renal damage and should be the focus of increased prevention efforts.",

        "Abstract":",\n['-1', '-1']\nAdolescents with Type 1 diabetes mellitus (T1DM) are at risk for hyperfiltration and elevated urinary albumin-to-creatinine ratio (ACR), which are early indicators of diabetic nephropathy. Adolescents with T1DM also develop early changes in blood pressure, cardiovascular structure, and function. Our aims were to define the relationships between hyperfiltration, ACR, and 24-h ambulatory blood pressure over time in adolescents with T1DM. Normotensive, normoalbuminuric adolescents ( n = 98) with T1DM underwent baseline and 2-yr 24-h ambulatory blood pressure monitoring, glomerular filtration rate (eGFR) estimated by cystatin C (Larsson equation) and ACR measurements. Linear regression models adjusted for diabetes duration, sex, and HbA1c were used to determine associations. Hyperfiltration (eGFR ≥ 133 ml\/min) was present in 31% at baseline and 21% at 2-yr follow-up. Hyperfiltration was associated with greater odds of rapid GFR decline (>3 ml·min·yr) [OR: 5.33, 95%; CI: 1.87-15.17; P = 0.002] over 2 yr. Natural log of ACR at baseline was associated with greater odds of hyperfiltration (OR: 1.71, 95% CI: 1.00-2.92; P = 0.049) and 2-yr follow-up (OR: 2.14, 95%; CI: 1.09-4.19; P = 0.03). One SD increase in eGFR, but not ln ACR, at 2-yr follow-up conferred greater odds of nighttime nondipping pattern (OR: 1.96, 95% CI: 1.06-3.63; P = 0.03). Hyperfiltration was prevalent at baseline and at 2-yr follow-up, predicted rapid decline in GFR, and was related to ACR. Elevated GFR at 2-yr follow-up was associated with nighttime nondipping pattern. More work is needed to better understand early relationships between renal hemodynamic and systemic hemodynamic changes in adolescents with T1DM to reduce future cardiorenal complications.",

Dosing regimens were selected and implemented after an individualized goal trough range was established (10-15 or 15-20mg\/L). Steady-state goal trough achievement was compared between treatment arms with and without adjustment for potential confounders.\nSETTING & PARTICIPANTS: 3 medical and surgical ICUs at a single tertiary medical center.\nQUALITY IMPROVEMENT PLAN: During January 2012 to October 2013, vancomycin was dosed according to eCL using the Cockcroft-Gault formula (control arm). During December 2013 to May 2015, a multidisciplinary quality improvement team implemented a novel vancomycin dosing algorithm according to eGFR using the CKD-EPI equation (intervention arm).\nOUTCOME: Steady-state initial goal vancomycin trough concentration achievement.\nMEASUREMENTS & RESULTS: More patients in the intervention arm (67 of 135 [50%]) achieved therapeutic trough vancomycin levels than in the control arm (74 of 264 [28%]; OR, 2.53; 95% CI, 1.65-3.90; P<0.001).

We aimed to investigate the association of estimated glomerular filtration rate (eGFR) and urinary albumin-to-creatinine ratio (UACR) with WML severity in first-ever stroke patients.\nMETHODS: We retrospectively enrolled 284 consecutive patients (177 male; median age 72years) admitted to our stroke center between May 2010 and January 2012. eGFR and UACR measurements were performed on admission. WML severity was assessed using the Fazekas classification. Severe WML was defined as a Fazekas grade of 2 or higher. The impact of eGFR and UACR on severe WML was evaluated using multiple logistic regression analysis.\nRESULTS: Age (P<0.0001), sex (P=0.0094), eGFR (P=0.0173), UACR (P=0.0001), hypertension (P=0.0436), and brain natriuretic peptide (P=0.0354) were significantly associated with severe WML. On multivariable logistic regression analysis, high UACR (≥39.6mg\/g creatinine, P=0.039), but not low eGFR (≤74ml\/min\/1.73m, P=0.3672), was independently associated with severe WML. Comparisons between the UACR levels showed that severe WML was more frequent in the UACR ≥300mg\/g creatinine group than in the UACR <30.0mg\/g creatinine group after multivariate adjustment (OR, 2.25; 95% CI, 1.04-5.00; P=0.039).

The baseline study visit took place at a mean (SD) 91 (23) days after discharge. The mean (SD) age was 65 (13) years; the median eGFR was 68 mL\/min\/1.73 m2; and the median urine ACR was 15 mg\/g. Overall, 547 (37%) study participants were women and 195 (13%) were black. After a median follow-up of 4.7 years, 138 (9%) participants had kidney disease progression. Higher post-AKI urine ACR level was associated with increased risk of kidney disease progression (hazard ratio [HR], 1.53 for each doubling; 95% CI, 1.45-1.62), and urine ACR measurement was a strong discriminator for future kidney disease progression (C statistic, 0.82). The performance of urine ACR was stronger in patients who had had AKI than in those who had not (C statistic, 0.70). A comprehensive model of clinical risk factors (eGFR, blood pressure, and demographics) including ACR provided better discrimination for predicting kidney disease progression after hospital discharge among those who had had AKI (C statistic, 0.85) vs those who had not (C statistic, 0.76). In the entire matched cohort, after taking into account urine ACR, eGFR, demographics, and traditional chronic kidney risk factors determined 3 months after discharge, AKI (HR, 1.46; 95% CI, 0.51-4.13 for AKI vs non-AKI) or severity of AKI (HR, 1.54; 95% CI, 0.50-4.72 for AKI stage 1 vs non-AKI; HR, 0.56; 95% CI, 0.07-4.84 for AKI stage 2 vs non-AKI; HR, 2.24; 95% CI, 0.33-15.29 for AKI stage 3 vs non-AKI) was not independently associated with more rapid kidney disease progression.\nCONCLUSIONS AND RELEVANCE: Proteinuria level is a valuable risk-stratification tool in the post-AKI period. These results suggest there should be more widespread and routine quantification of proteinuria after hospitalized AKI.",

        "Published":"2018-08-17",
        "Abstract":"OBJECTIVE: There is a growing interest in the relationship between obesity and renal damage. The effect of obesity on renal function in children and adolescents has not been adequately investigated. In addition, there is no complete consensus on the reliability of various renal function parameters. The primary goal of this study was to evaluate renal function in obese children and adolescents using glomerular filtration rate (GFR), cystatin C, and creatinine (Cr)-derived formulas. We also compared classical GFR measurement methods with methods based on bioimpedance analysis-derived body cell mass (BCM).\nMETHODS: We enrolled 108 obese and 46 healthy subjects aged 6-18 years. Serum cystatin C, serum Cr, 24-hour proteinuria, Cr clearance, and GFR were evaluated in both groups. Estimated GFR was measured with Cr-based, cystatin C-based, combined (cystatin C and Cr) and BCM-based formulae. Both actual and fat-free mass body surface areas (BSA) were used when required. Metabolic parameters (blood glucose, insulin, and lipids) were analyzed in the obese subjects. International Diabetes Federation criteria were used to identify metabolic syndrome (MetS).\nRESULTS: We did not detect statistically significant differences between the obese and control groups for mean Cr (p=0.658) and mean cystatin C (p=0.126). Mean cystatin C levels of MetS patients were significantly higher than those of non-MetS obese participants (p<0.001). Cr-based GFR measurements, BCM-based measurements and a combined Cr and cystatin C measurement showed a statistically significant increase in the GFR of obese subjects compared to controls (p=0.002 and p<0.001). This increase was negatively correlated with duration of obesity. Estimations based on actual or fat-free mass BSA did not differ either. Only the Filler equation showed a statistically significant decrease in eGFR in MetS patients. There were no statistically significant differences between the obese and control groups for proteinuria (p=0.994) and fat-free mass proteinuria (p=0.476).\nCONCLUSION: We conclude that cystatin C could be used as an earlier biomarker than Cr in the detection of impaired renal function in obese children, especially those with MetS. Cr-based formulae reveal hyperfiltration as the first change in renal function. Decreasing eGFR seen in MetS patients with cystatin C-based formulae, but not Cr-based formulae, may represent the early stages of renal damage. Using fat-free mass or BCM for eGFR formulae in obese children seems to provide no additional information.",

The association between renal insufficiency and increased cardiovascular disease-related and all-cause mortality rates during 16 yr of follow-up monitoring was examined among participants who were 30 to 74 yr of age at the baseline examinations in 1976 to 1980, with urinary protein dipstick measurements (n = 8786) or serum creatinine levels of <or=3.0 mg\/dl (n = 6354), from the Second National Health and Nutrition Examination Survey Mortality Study. GFR were estimated by adjusting serum creatinine levels for age, race, and gender, using the Modification of Diet in Renal Disease formula. Cardiovascular disease-related mortality rates were 6.2, 17.9, and 37.2 deaths\/1000 person-yr among subjects with urinary protein levels of <30, 30 to 299, and >or=300 mg\/dl and were 4.1, 8.6, and 20.5 deaths\/1000 person-yr among participants with estimated GFR of >or=90, 70 to 89, and <70 ml\/min, respectively.

A linear correlation was obtained when SBM values were logarithmically transformed. This relationship was significantly better than that between serum creatinine corrected for body height (Ht\/SCR) and Cr51 EDTA clearance. The scatter around the regression line, especially for the lower log SBM values was, however, too large to permit an acceptable prediction of the GFR. Correction of the SBM values for height did not significantly alter this relationship. We conclude from our findings that, although there is a good linear correlation between log SBM and GFR, the latter cannot be predicted within acceptable limits from SBM values in children.",

Hyperglycaemia is the main and primary metabolic disorder in T1D. One of the complications developing as a result of microangiopathy is diabetic nephropathy (DN). Additionally, diabetes remains the most common reason for progressing to end-stage renal disease (ESRD). The aim of the study was to evaluate the most initial metabolic and functional disorders in diabetic children and children with DN. The study involved 76 children with T1D and diabetic nephropathy (aged 3 to 17 years). The levels of ET-1 measured using ELISA assay and ratio of lipid oxidation measured spectrophotometrically. Main clinical parameters (blood pressure, glycaemia, albuminuria, creatininaemia, HbA1C, cholesterol levels) were measured using conventional methods available in Clinical Paediatric Hospital No. 6 (Kyiv, Ukraine). The glomerular filtration rate (GFR) was calculated using the Schwartz formula. Patterns of the BP changes, kidney function impairment, ET-level, and metabolic and functional disorders in children with T1D and DN were found.",

        "Abstract":"BACKGROUND: The Chronic Kidney Disease in children (CKiD) equation to estimate glomerular filtration rate eGFR = k × Ht \/ SCr (Ht = height in cm, SCr = serum creatinine in mg\/dL), with fixed k = 0.413, has recently been optimized by introducing age\/sex dependent k-values valid for young children up to young adults (the CKiD Under 25 years (CKiDU25) equation). Although the CKiD equation was designed for children with chronic kidney disease (CKD), this equation found common use both clinically and in research, and also in children without CKD. This report aims to evaluate properties of CKiD and CKiDU25 in healthy children and adolescents.\nMETHOD: Sex-specific metadata (height and creatinine) for healthy children were obtained from national growth curves and creatinine versus age curves. These data were used to calculate average CKiD and CKiDU25 values for each year of age and compare them against age-independent measured GFR of 107 mL\/min\/1.73 m.\nRESULTS: The CKiD estimations show a steep decline with age (1.5 mL\/min\/1.73 m\/year in females and 2.0 mL\/min\/1.73 m\/year in males) over the entire age range (2-20 years) and large differences between adolescent males and females. Due to the age\/sex specific k-values, the CKiDU25 equation solves this age-decline artifact of the CKiD equation. However, CKiDU25 still shows a systematic higher estimation of about 10% in healthy males compared to females over the entire age range.\nCONCLUSION: Although the CKiDU25 shows major improvements compared to the CKiD equation, as the unexpected age decline has been removed, a systematic difference is still observed between healthy males and females.",

Preoperative and postoperative GFR is measured by emission computed tomography (ECT) with 99mTc-DTPA as an imaging agent as reference GFR (rGFR) to compare with all formulas. Spearman correlation analysis and Bland-Altman agreement analysis were used to evaluate the correlation between rGFR and eGFR1 to 14 before and after surgery. A total of 50 cases including 22 males and 28 females were included. The results of preoperative eGFR1-14 correlated with rGFR ( < 0.05). The calculation results of all estimation formulas have a significant correlation with preoperative GFR. Preoperative MDRD-I, CKD-EPI , and FAS  have good consistency. The CG formula has the highest precision and FAS  has the highest accuracy. A total of 30 patients followed up after surgery, and postoperative rGFR correlated with CG, CKD-EPI, FAS, and BIS formulas ( < 0.05).

        "Abstract":"OBJECTIVE: We analyzed residual renal function (RRF) in a large number of new peritoneal dialysis (PD) patients to prospectively define the time course of decline of RRF and to evaluate the risk factors assumed to be associated with faster decline.\nSTUDY DESIGN: Single-center, prospective cohort study.\nSETTING: Home PD unit of a tertiary care University Hospital.\nPATIENTS: The study included 242 patients starting continuous PD between January 1994 and December 1997, with a minimum follow-up of 6 months and at least three measurements of RRF.\nMEASUREMENT: All patients had data on demographic and laboratory variables, episodes of peritonitis and the use of aminoglycoside (AG) antibiotics, temporary hemodialysis, and number of radiocontrast studies. Adequacy of PD was measured from 24-hour urine and dialysate collection and peritoneal equilibration test using standard methodology. Further data on RRF was collected every 3 to 4 months until the patient became anuric (urine volume < 100 mL\/day or creatinine clearance < 1.0 mL\/min) or until the end of study in December 1998.\nOUTCOME MEASURE: The slope of the decline of residual glomerular filtration rate (GFR) (an average of renal urea and creatinine clearance) was the main outcome measure. Risk factors associated with faster decline were evaluated by a comparative analysis between patients in the highest and the lowest quartiles of the slopes of GFR, and a multivariate analysis using a stepwise option within linear regression and general linear models.\nRESULTS: There was a gradual deterioration of residual GFR with time on PD, with 40% of patients developing anuria at a mean of 20 months after the initiation of PD. On multivariate analysis, use of a larger volume of dialysate (p = 0.0001), higher rate of peritonitis (p = 0.0005), higher use of AG (p = 0.0006), presence of diabetes mellitus (p = 0.005), larger body mass index (BMI) (p = 0.01), and no use of antihypertensive medications (p = 0.04) independently predicted the steep slope of residual GFR. Male gender, higher grades of left ventricular dysfunction, and higher 24-hour proteinuria were associated with faster decline on univariate analysis only.\nCONCLUSION: Faster decline of residual GFR corresponds with male gender, large BMI, presence of diabetes mellitus, higher grades of congestive heart failure, and higher 24-hour proteinuria. Higher rate of peritonitis and use of AG for the treatment of peritonitis is also associated independently with faster decline of residual GFR. Whether the type of PD (CAPD vs CCPD\/NIPD) is associated with faster decline of residual GFR remains speculative.",

        "Abstract":"BACKGROUND: In clinical practice there is need for a simple and reliable test for determination of impaired renal function. With reductions in GFR, the plasma cystatin C concentration (C, mg\/l) will increase earlier than serum creatinine, and it is generally agreed that plasma cystatin C is only little affected by body weight, age or sex. However, some reports indicate that cystatin C may be influenced not only by GFR, but also by malignancy, inflammation and high doses of corticosteroids. The aim of the present study was to investigate how plasma cystatin C predicts GFR in distinct subcategories of patients with various disorders as well as in organ transplant patients.\nMETHODS: Plasma cystatin C was measured in 536 patients (age range 0.3-96 years, 262 females, 274 males), consecutively referred to our hospital for determination of GFR by iohexol clearance. Correlations of log GFR vs. log cystatin C were used to compare plasma cystatin C and measured GFR for the following categories: individuals with no known kidney disease (No-KD), malignant patients with (mostly) normal GFR, solid organ-transplanted patients, and patients with native chronic kidney disease (CKD).\nRESULTS: In patients with normal kidney function and cystatin C level <or= 1 mg\/l, the cystatin C was poorly correlated with GFR (R2=0.13). By contrast, in patients with chronic kidney disease (log) plasma cystatin C was highly correlated with (log) GFR (R2=0.87). This correlation was more or less unchanged whether the cause of the reduction in GFR was CKD at Stages 1-3 (90>GFR>30 ml\/min(-1) (1.73 m2)(-1)) or solid organ transplantation (GFR=84.55 C(1.7666) and GFR=83.95(C-1.5968), respectively).\nCONCLUSION: Therefore, for these categories, a common equation for all patients with increased cystatin C, irrespective of cause of renal impairment, could be used, namely that presented by Grubb et al. [2005] (GFR=83.93(C-1.676)). However, at marked reductions of renal function (GFR<30 or cystatin C>2), i.e. for CKD Stages 4 and 5, the Grubb prediction equation is less accurate. Based on our data, we suggest the equation GFR=50.52 C(-1.26) for this category of patients.",

Multivariable logistic regression evaluated the association of kidney function with AVC and MAC.\nRESULTS: Of 6,785 participants, 10% had an eGFR less than 60 mL\/min\/1.73 m(2) (<1.0 mL\/s\/1.73 m(2)), mean cystatin C level was 0.9 +\/- 0.2 mg\/L, 7% had microalbuminuria (albumin >or= 30 mg\/g), 15% had diabetes, 13% had AVC, and 9% had MAC.

        "Abstract":"Calprotectin is a protein molecule that is released from inflammatory cells. Measurement of calprotectin in various body fluids has recently gained significant importance for differentiating inflammatory and noninflammatory events. The subject has aroused interest in the field of nephrology and some renal pathologies in which urinary calprotectin levels have been studied. In this study, the measurement of urinary calprotectin level and its use for determining acute cisplatin nephrotoxicity in a group of patients with non-small cell lung cancer who received cisplatin-based oncological treatments have been investigated. The study included 41 patients who received cisplatin-based treatments for non-small cell lung cancer between January 2019 and January 2020. The patients were excluded from this study who were with estimated glomerular filtration rate (eGFR) <60 mL\/min\/1.73 m2, serum creatinine (sCr) >1.5 mg\/dL, a history of urinary tract infection, and nephrotoxic drug use in the past month. Baseline and 48-hour sCr values and baseline, 6-hour, 12-hour, 24-hour, and 48-hour urinary calprotectin levels of all patients were measured. Four of the 41 patients who received cisplatin treatment were excluded because their 48-hour sCr values could not be accessed. The control group included 29 patients. While there was no difference between the cisplatin group and the control group in terms of baseline sCr and eGFR values, the cisplatin group had significantly higher urinary calprotectin values. Of the 37 patients treated with cisplatin, 7 (18.9%) developed cisplatin-induced nephrotoxicity. The comparison of groups with (group 1) and without cisplatin nephrotoxicity (group 2) showed comparable mean age and male sex ratio. Baseline sCr and eGFR values were similar in both groups. The cisplatin-induced nephrotoxicity group had significantly higher 48-hour sCr and significantly lower 48-hour eGFR values. Baseline, 12-hour, 24-hour, and 48-hour urinary calprotectin levels were similar in groups with and without cisplatin nephrotoxicity. Recent studies have demonstrated that urinary calprotectin level measurement can be used to distinguish intrinsic acute kidney disease from prerenal kidney disease. However, the comparison of groups with and without cisplatin nephrotoxicity in our study showed no difference in urinary calprotectin levels. However, there is a need for large-scale studies using combined urinary biomarkers.",

We compared DTPA-GFR with estimated GFR from KL\/Cr and Cockroft-Gault equations for three groups: all patients, patients with DTPA-GFR < or = 140 ml.min-1 x 1.73 m-2, and patients with DTPA-GFR > 140 ml.min-1 x 1.73 m-2.\nRESULTS: For all patients, mean values for DTPA-GFR = 147 (95% confidence interval, 139-155), for KL\/Cr = 118 (110-125), and for Cockroft-Gault = 84 ml.min-1 x 1.73 m-2 (78-90). For patients with DTPA-GFR < or = 140, DTPA-GFR = 123 (117-128), KL\/Cr = 110 (100-119), and Cockroft-Gault = 92 (82-102). For patients with DTPA-GFR > 140, DTPA-GFR = 167 (158-177), KL\/Cr = 125 (114-136), and Cockroft-Gault = 77 (71-84). Linear regression analysis showed significant (P < 0.05) relationships for KL\/Cr only in patients with DTPA-GFR < or = 140 (r = 0.29), for Cockroft-Gault in all patients (r = -0.46), and for patients with DTPA-GFR < or = 140 (r = -0.31). Determination of a revised K for use in KL\/Cr from individual calculations of K (DTPA-GFR x Cr\/L) yielded an average value of 0.70 (SD = 0.11). With the use of K = 0.7, the mean KL\/Cr value for patients with DTPA-GFR < or = 140 ml.min-1 x 1.73 m-2 was 125 +\/- 27 (95% confidence interval, 115-135), compared with a DTPA-GFR value of 123 +\/- 14 (95% confidence interval, 117-128).\nCONCLUSIONS: KL\/Cr and Cockroft-Gault do not accurately estimate DTPA plasma clearance. We recommend the use of K equal to 0.70 when estimating GFR in children and adolescents with IDDM and DTPA-GFR < or = 140 using KL\/Cr and do not recommend the use of the KL\/Cr (for patients with DTPA-GFR > 140) or the Cockroft-Gault equation in this population.",

This study examines the short-term (3 months) effect of donor nephrectomy on GFR and the occurrence of stage 3 chronic kidney disease (CKD) postuninephrectomy.\nMETHODS: The prevalence of stage 3 CKD (Kidney Disease Quality Outcome Initiative [GFR<60 mL\/min\/1.73 m]) was examined in 196 living donors by comparing preuninephrectomy and 3-month postuninephrectomy values of GFR using I-iothalamate GFR (iGFR), modification of diet in renal disease estimated GFR (eGFR), Cockcroft-Gault estimated creatinine clearance, and endogenous 24-hr creatinine clearance. The accuracy of GFR estimations for predicting iGFR was also studied.\nRESULTS: The mean GFR before and after donation were iGFR, 105+\/-18 and 68+\/-13 mL\/min\/1.73 m; eGFR, 98+\/-19 and 63+\/-12 mL\/min\/1.73 m; Cockcroft-Gault estimated creatinine clearance, 125+\/-33 and 85+\/-22 mL\/min\/1.73 m, and endogenous 24-hr creatinine clearance, 133+\/-38 and 86+\/-24 mL\/min\/1.73 m, respectively. Stage 3 CKD was found postuninephrectomy in 53 donors (27%) by iGFR and in 73 donors (38%) by eGFR. The prevalence of stage 3 CKD was greater with older age. GFR estimation equations did not accurately predict iGFR, particularly postuninephrectomy.\nCONCLUSIONS: Stage 3 CKD is commonly observed after living kidney donation, particularly in older donors. The long-term impact of stage 3 CKD postuninephrectomy is poorly understood and may not have the same implications as stage 3 CKD in other conditions. eGFR is a poor predictor of true GFR in kidney donors.",

Duplicate measurements of the following were collected from each subject, 2 weeks apart: cystatin C, enzymatic plasma creatinine, 24-h creatinine clearance, GFR estimated from plasma creatinine by the Cockcroft-Gault equation, and iohexol clearance as a gold standard. RESULTS-Iohexol clearance ranged from 35 to 132 ml. min(-1). 1.73 m(-2). Plasma cystatin C compared well with the other clinically used tests. The reliability of cystatin C, as assessed by the discriminant ratio, was superior to creatinine clearance (3.4 vs. 1.5, P < 0.001) and the correlation of cystatin C with iohexol clearance (Rs -0.80) was similar to that of creatinine clearance (Rs -0.74) and superior to that of plasma creatinine and the Cockcroft-Gault estimate (Rs -0.54 and 0.66, respectively). Duplicate estimations were used to provide an unbiased equation to convert plasma cystatin C to GFR. CONCLUSIONS-Based on this study, cystatin C is a more reliable measure of GFR than creatinine clearance, is more highly correlated with iohexol clearance than plasma creatinine, and is worthy of further investigation as a clinical measure of GFR in type 1 diabetes.",

We compared bias (median difference in measured GFR [mGFR] and eGFR), precision (interquartile range [IQR] of differences), accuracy (percentage of eGFR within 30% of mGFR), root mean square error (RMSE), and classification of mGFR <60 ml\/min\/1.73 m (area under the receiver operating characteristic curve [AUC] and net reclassification index [NRI]) among eGFR equations.\nRESULTS: We found that eGFRcys underestimated mGFR (bias, 12.7 ml\/min\/1.73 m [95% confidence interval {CI} 10.7-15.2]). eGFRcr-cys did not improve performance over eGFRcr-PK in precision ( = 0.52), accuracy ( = 0.58), or RMSE ( = 0.49).

The expression of CD90 correlated with fibrogenesis. However, the association between urinary soluble CD90 and renal disease severity, and whether it predicts outcomes in patients with DKD are still unclear.\nMETHODS: Urinary sCD90 was measured in 285 patients with DKD in a longitudinal cohort. The composite endpoint was defined as end-stage renal disease (ESRD) or 40% reduction of estimated glomerular filtration rate (eGFR). The associations between urinary sCD90\/Cr and clinical parameters, as well as renal outcomes were evaluated. Moreover, we detected the intrarenal CD90 expression, and demonstrated the correlation of intrarenal CD90 with clinico-pathological parameters.\nRESULTS: The urinary sCD90 level of DKD patients is significantly higher than diabetes patients without kidney injuries and healthy controls. We further showed urinary sCD90\/Cr had significantly correlations with eGFR (r=-0.373, P<0.001), uACR (r=0.303, P<0.001), serum creatinine (r=0.344, P<0.001), and the eGFR slope (r=-0.27, P<0.001). Elevated urinary sCD90\/Cr was an independent risk factor for the composite endpoint, adjustment for potential confounders in DKD patients (HR 1.20, 95% CI: 1.04-1.38, P=0.015). However, the CD90 expression in the renal tubulointerstitial compartment in DKD patients was significantly lower than healthy controls, and showed significant negative correlations with the interstitial fibrosis and tubular atrophy score (IFTA) (r=-0.3, P=0.047), and urinary sCD90\/Cr (r=-0.399, P=0.029).\nCONCLUSIONS: This study provided evidence that urinary sCD90 could reflect the disease severity and serve as a valuable factor for renal outcome prediction in patients with DKD.",

This study aimed to identify predictive factors for and consequences of TVR-associated renal dysfunction.\nPATIENTS AND METHODS: A retrospective-prospective study was carried out in 96 patients with chronic hepatitis C, genotype 1, treated with TVR-based tritherapy in 2012-2013, in whom regular serum creatinine measurements were performed during the first 12 weeks of treatment. The patients received standard doses of peginterferon, ribavirin and TVR (2250 mg\/day). The estimated glomerular filtration rate (eGFR) was calculated using the Modification of Diet in Renal Disease formula.\nRESULTS: eGFR decreased significantly from baseline at weeks 4, 8 and 12, the mean maximum decrease being 22.0±23.6 ml\/min, with a significant correlation between baseline and minimum eGFR (r=0.58, P<10), stronger between week 2 and minimum eGFR in the subgroup of 62 patients in whom creatinine measurement was performed at week 2. Thirteen patients had an eGFR below 60 ml\/min during treatment. Age and baseline eGFR were independent predictors of eGFR below 60 ml\/min in the entire population, and only week 2 eGFR when available. The decrease in haemoglobin was significantly correlated with the decrease in eGFR. Age, baseline haemoglobin and the maximum variation in eGFR were independent predictors for minimum haemoglobin. The patients with decreased eGFR had more severe anaemia, and received more blood transfusions and erythropoietin. Renal dysfunction regressed in all patients after stopping TVR.\nCONCLUSION: The reversible decrease in eGFR in patients receiving TVR-containing tritherapy can be predicted early, possibly allowing measures aimed at preventing anaemia.",

        "Abstract":"OBJECTIVES: To evaluate the performance of kidney function estimation equations and to determine the frequency of drug dose discordance in an older population.\nDESIGN: Cross-sectional analysis of data from community-dwelling volunteers randomly selected from the Baltimore Longitudinal Study of Aging from January 1, 2005, to December 31, 2010.\nSUBJECTS: A total of 269 men and women with a mean ± SD age of 81 ± 6 years, mean serum creatinine concentration (Scr ) of 1.1 ± 0.4 mg\/dl, and mean 24-hour measured creatinine clearance (mClcr ) of 53 ± 13 ml\/minute.\nMEASUREMENTS AND MAIN RESULTS: Kidney function was estimated by using the following equations: Cockcroft-Gault (CG), Modification of Diet in Renal Disease (MDRD), and Chronic Kidney Disease Epidemiology Collaboration (CKD-EPI). The performance of each equation was assessed by measuring bias and precision relative to mClcr . Dose calculation errors (discordance) were determined for 10 drugs requiring renal dosage adjustments to avoid toxicity when compared with the dosages approved by the Food and Drug Administration. The CG equation was the least biased estimate of mClcr . The MDRD and CKD-EPI equations were significantly positively biased compared with CG (mean ± SD 34 ± 20% and 22 ± 15%, respectively, p<0.001) and mClcr (29 ± 47% and 18 ± 40%, respectively, p<0.001). Rounding low Scr values (less than 1.0 mg\/dl) up to an arbitrary value of 1.0 mg\/dl resulted in CG values (44 ± 10 ml\/minute) that were significantly lower than mClcr (56 ± 12 ml\/minute, p<0.001) and CG (56 ± 15 ml\/minute, p<0.001). The MDRD and CKD-EPI equations had median dose discordance rates of 28.6% and 22.9%, respectively.\nCONCLUSION: The MDRD and CKD-EPI equations significantly overestimated creatinine clearance (mClcr and CG) in elderly individuals. This leads to dose calculation errors for many drugs, particularly in individuals with severe renal impairment. Thus equations estimating glomerular filtration rate should not be substituted in place of the CG equation in older adults for the purpose of renal dosage adjustments. In addition, the common practice of rounding or replacing low Scr values with an arbitrary value of 1.0 mg\/dl for use in the CG equation should be avoided. Additional studies that evaluate alternative eGFR equations in the older populations that incorporate pharmacokinetic and pharmacodynamic outcomes measures are needed.",

GFR was measured using the gold standard Tc-99m DTPA (Tc-99m diethylenetriaminepentaacetic acid) renal scan. We compared the latter with the eGFR, calculated using the Cockroft-Gault formula, Modification of Diet in Renal Disease (MDRD), Chronic Kidney Disease Epidemiology Collaboration (CKD-EPI) equation and creatinine clearance equation.\nRESULTS: A total of 76 patients with scleroderma (50 women and 26 men) with median age 54.8 years (interquartile range: 47.4 to 58.9) were enrolled.

The aim of this study was to find a reliable alternative to inulin clearance that would allow one to avoid the use of radioactivity and problems related to the continuous infusion of the marker. The plasma clearance of unlabeled iohexol, a nonionic contrast agent, was used. Forty-one patients (creatinine clearance 6 to 160 mL\/min per 1.73 m2) underwent simultaneous measurements of renal clearance of inulin and plasma clearance of iohexol. Iohexol was given as a single iv dose, and blood samples were drawn up to 600 min after the administration. Iohexol concentrations (by HPLC) were analyzed by a two-compartment, open-model system. A highly significant correlation between the plasma clearance of iohexol and the renal clearance of inulin over a wide range of GFR values was found. By analyzing the data with a simplified method that uses a one-compartment model corrected with the Bröchner-Mortensen formula, an excellent correlation with the inulin clearance was also observed. When only patients with moderate to severe renal failure were considered, a significant correlation between the two methods was found. A further comparison between GFR determined with iohexol and iopromide, a new low-osmolarity, low-viscosity contrast medium, was also performed in a subgroup of patients.(ABSTRACT TRUNCATED AT 250 WORDS)",

We aimed to compare the predictive performance of different equations available to estimate GFR in paediatric oncology patients.\nMETHODS: GFR was measured (mGFR) in paediatric oncology patients based on a chromium 51-labeled ethylene diamine tetraacetic acid excretion test. GFR was estimated (eGFR) in these same patients using equations identified from the literature. mGFR and eGFR values were compared, and the predictive performance of various eGFR equations was assessed in terms of their bias, precision and accuracy.\nRESULTS: In total, 124 mGFR values ranging from 7 to 146 mL\/min were available for analysis from 73 children. Twenty-two equations were identified from the literature. The Flanders metadata equation displayed the lowest absolute bias (mean error of 0.9 mL\/min) and the greatest precision (root mean square error of 13.1 mL\/min). The univariate Schwartz equation predicted the highest percentage (81.5%) of eGFR values within 30% of mGFR values, and the Rhodin fat-free mass equation predicted the highest percentage (37.1%) of eGFR values within 10% of mGFR values.\nCONCLUSIONS: A number of equations were identified that could be used to estimate renal function in paediatric oncology patients; however, none was found to be highly accurate. The Flanders metadata equation and univariate Schwartz performed the best in this study, and we would suggest that these two equations may be used cautiously in paediatric oncology patients for clinical decision making, understanding their limitations.",

        "Abstract":"BACKGROUND: The Chronic Kidney Disease in Children (CKiD) study reported new formulae to estimate glomerular filtration rate (eGFR). The study reported here aimed to assess the accuracy of these formulae in estimating levels and changes in GFR in pediatric renal transplant recipients and generate a new formula in our cohort.\nMETHODS: Two hundred and fifty-two studies of plasma disappearance of (125)I-iothalamate (CIO) were used to measure GFR in 155 renal transplant recipients. The CKiD bedside formula (CKiD-BS) was compared with CIO. A mixed logistic regression model was fit to evaluate the performance of estimating change in posttransplant CIO using CKiD-BS. We used mixed-effects linear regression to fit a multiplicative model of CIO. The CKiD cystatin-C-based formula (CKiD-Cys) was also used for comparison in 32 additional transplant recipients. Comparisons were made using Bland-Altman plots.\nRESULTS: CKiD-BS underestimates CIO by 20 % for GFR >25 ml\/min per 1.73 m(2). Percentage change in CKiD-BS performed reasonably well in estimating 15 % change of CIO beginning 6 months posttransplant [area under the curve (AUC) = 0.791)] The multiplicative constant in the CKiD-BS was recalibrated [R-Bedside = 0.461 × ht(cm)\/SCr).]A GFR model [GFR-M) = 10.73 × [(ht(cm)]0.51\/(SCr)0.90 × (BUN)0.23] has higher specificity but similar sensitivity for CIO compared with R-Bedside. CKiD-Cys overestimates CIO by 10 ml\/min per 1.73 m(2) across a broad range of GFR.\nCONCLUSIONS: In our cohort, the CKiD-BS underestimates CIO; however, changes in CKiD-BS can be used to estimate changes in CIO. CKiD-Cys overestimates CIO and is not accurate in estimating CIO.",

        "Abstract":"BACKGROUND: Several models for predicting acute kidney injury following cardiac surgery have been published, and various end-point definitions have been used.\nOBJECTIVES: Our aim was to investigate how acute kidney injury following cardiac surgery could be most accurately predicted.\nDESIGN: Single-centre prospective observational study.\nSETTING: St Olav's University Hospital, Trondheim, Norway, from 2000 to 2007.\nPATIENTS: All 5029 adult patients undergoing cardiac surgery were considered eligible for participation. Patients who required preoperative dialysis and patients with missing information on preoperative or maximum postoperative serum creatinine concentration were excluded (n=51). A total of 4978 patients were entered into the statistical analyses.\nMAIN OUTCOME MEASURES: Logistic regression with bootstrapping methods was applied for model development and validation, together with the area under the receiver operating characteristic curve and Hosmer-Lemeshow test. We tested different end-points, exchanged serum creatinine concentration with creatinine clearance or estimated glomerular filtration rate and added intraoperative variables. The main end-point was at least 50% increase in serum creatinine concentration, an increase in concentration by at least 26.4 μmol l(-1) (0.3 mg dl(-1)) or a new requirement for dialysis after surgery.\nRESULTS: The final model consisted of 11 preoperative predictors of acute kidney injury: age, BMI, lipid-lowering treatment, hypertension, peripheral vascular disease, chronic pulmonary disease, haemoglobin concentration, serum creatinine concentration, previous cardiac surgery, emergency operation and operation type. The area under the receiver operating characteristic curve was 0.819 (95% confidence interval 0.801 to 0.837), and the Hosmer-Lemeshow test P value was 0.17. Exchanging serum creatinine concentration with glomerular filtration rate or creatinine clearance slightly reduced model discrimination and the addition of intraoperative variables improved discrimination somewhat. Slight end-point definition changes had little impact.\nCONCLUSION: The risk of acute kidney injury can be accurately predicted using preoperative variables. Serum creatinine concentration was more accurate than estimated glomerular filtration rate or creatinine clearance. Intraoperative variables slightly improved the model, but did not seem to outweigh the advantages of a preoperative model.",

        "Abstract":"Decreased kidney function, determined using a serum creatinine-based estimation of GFR, is associated with a higher risk for mortality from cardiovascular disease. Equations incorporating cystatin C improve the estimation of GFR, but whether this improves the prediction of risk for mortality is unknown. We measured cystatin C on 6942 adult participants in the Third National Health and Nutrition Examination Survey Linked Mortality File, including all participants who had high serum creatinine (>1.2 mg\/dl for men; >1.0 mg\/dl for women) or were older than 60 yr and 25% random sample of participants who were younger than 60 yr. We estimated GFR using equations that included standardized serum creatinine, cystatin C, or both. Participant data were linked to the National Death Index. A total of 1573 (22.7%) deaths (713 deaths from cardiovascular disease) occurred during a median of 8 yr. Lower estimated GFR based on cystatin C was strongly associated with higher risk for overall and cardiovascular mortality across the range of normal to moderately decreased estimated GFR. Creatinine-based estimates of GFR resulted in weaker associations, with the association between estimated GFR and all-cause mortality reversed at higher levels of estimated GFR. An equation using both creatinine and cystatin C (in addition to age, race, and gender) resulted in weaker associations than equations using only cystatin C (with or without age, race, and gender). In conclusion, despite better performance in terms of estimating GFR, equations based on both cystatin C and creatinine do not predict mortality as well as equations based on cystatin C alone.",

We developed new GFR-estimating equations based on standardized cystatin C for a Japanese population and compared their accuracy with the CKD-EPI equations.\nSTUDY DESIGN: Accuracy of diagnostic test study.\nSETTING & PARTICIPANTS: 413 (development data set) and 350 individuals (validation data set).\nINDEX TEST: CKD-EPI(cys); CKD-EPI(cr-cys); modifications to CKD-EPI(cys) and CKD-EPI(cr-cys) using Japanese coefficients; and newly developed Japanese eGFR equations based on standardized serum cystatin C (Eq(cys)), cystatin C with a nonrenal factor reflecting hypothesized extrarenal elimination (Eq(cys+nonrenal)), and creatinine in combination with cystatin C (Eq(cr-cys)). Standardized cystatin C values were determined by a colloidal gold immunoassay traceable to the international certified reference material ERM-DA471\/IFCC.\nREFERENCE TEST: Measured GFR by inulin renal clearance.\nRESULTS: In a development data set, we calculated Japanese coefficients for CKD-EPI(cys) and CKD-EPI(cr-cys) of 0.977 (95% CI, 0.853-1.002) and 0.908 (95% CI, 0.889-0.928), respectively. In a validation data set, we compared CKD-EPI(cys), Eq(cys), and Eq(cys+nonrenal) with each other. Bias and accuracy were not significantly different among the 3 equations. The precision of CKD-EPI(cys) was significantly better than for Eq(cys) (P = 0.007) and not significantly different from Eq(cys+nonrenal) (P = 0.6). We then compared 0.908 × CKD-EPI(cr-cys), Eq(cr-cys), and Eq(average) (the average value of Eq(cr) [previous Japanese equation based on standardized serum creatinine] and Eq(cys+nonrenal)) with each other in the validation data set. Bias and accuracy were not significantly different among the 3 equations. The precision of 0.908 × CKD-EPI(cr-cys) was significantly better than for Eq(cr-cys) (P = 0.004) and not significantly different from Eq(average) (P = 0.06).\nLIMITATIONS: Limited number of participants with measured GFR >90 mL\/min\/1.73 m(2). Extrarenal elimination of cystatin C was not measured.\nCONCLUSIONS: CKD-EPI(cys) performed well in Japanese individuals, suggesting that equations based on serum cystatin C could be used in patients with different races without modification.

        "Published":"2020-07-07",
        "Abstract":"BACKGROUND: Renal abnormalities in HIV infected children may be due to the HIV infection or treatment among other factors. Tenofovir disoproxil fumarate (TDF) is associated with proximal renal tubular dysfunction, proteinuria and decrease in glomerular function. Studies in developed countries have shown variable prevalence of proximal renal tubular dysfunction in children on TDF. There are no known studies in developing countries, including Zimbabwe, documenting the proximal tubular function in HIV infected children on TDF. The aim of this study was to assess renal and proximal renal tubular function in HIV infected children receiving TDF and determine factors associated with proximal tubular dysfunction.\nMETHODS: A descriptive cross-sectional study was conducted in HIV infected patients below 18 years of age attending outpatient clinics at two tertiary hospitals in Harare, who received a TDF-containing antiretroviral regimen for at least six months. Dipstick protein and glucose, serum and urine phosphate and creatinine levels were measured. Fractional excretion of phosphate was calculated. Estimated glomerular filtration rate (eGFR) was calculated using the Schwartz formula. Tubular dysfunction was defined by at least two of the following characteristics: normoglycaemic glycosuria, hypophosphatemia and fractional excretion of phosphate > 18%.\nFINDINGS: One hundred and ninety-eight children below 18 years of age were recruited over a period of six months. The prevalence of tubular dysfunction was 0.5%. Normoglycaemic glycosuria occurred in 1 (0.5%), fractional excretion of phosphate >18% in 4 (2%), and hypophosphatemia in 22 [11.1%] patients. Severe stunting was associated with increased risk of hypophosphatemia (OR 9.31 CI (1.18, 80.68) p = 0.03). Reduction in estimated glomerular filtration rate (eGFR) < 90ml\/min\/1.73m2 and proteinuria was evident in 35.9% and 32.8% of children, respectively. Concurrent TDF and HIV-1 protease inhibitor-based regimen was the only independent factor associated with reduction in GFR (OR 4.43 CI (1.32; 4.89) p = 0.016).\nCONCLUSION: Tubular dysfunction was uncommon in Zimbabwean children on a TDF-based ART regimen. Hypophosphatemia, proteinuria and reduction in eGFR were common. Reassessing renal function using more sensitive biomarkers is needed to examine the long-term tolerance of TDF.",

NGAL was measured in both urinary and serum sample of 144 type 2 diabetes individuals stratified into three categories based on urinary albumin-creatinine ratio and 54 control populations with estimated glomerular filtration rate >60 mL\/min\/1.73 m and serum creatinine <1.2 mg\/dl. The serum NGAL (sNGAL), urine NGAL (uNGAL), and uNGAL\/urine creatinine were significantly higher in diabetic individuals than in the control populations with significant difference in between the groups ( < 0.05). Difference of above values between control value and normoalbuminuria was also statistically significant ( < 0.05). Again, sNGAL and uNGAL correlate positively with albuminuria ( < 0.05). Tubular injury may precede glomerular injury in diabetic individuals, and NGAL can be used as a biomarker to diagnose DN even earlier to incipient nephropathy. Both sNGAL and uNGAL can predict albuminuria and be used as a noninvasive tool for diagnosis, staging, and progression of DN.",
