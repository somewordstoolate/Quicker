        "Abstract":"AIM OF THE STUDY: Necrotizing soft tissue infections (STIs) are serious complications that may arise from pressure ulcers. However, there are few studies on this important issue. In addition, diagnostic criteria for necrotizing STIs developing from pressure ulcers and infected pressure ulcers are not well established.\nMETHODS: We defined necrotizing STIs developing from pressure ulcers based on clinical findings. Based on the definition, we retrospectively analyzed the medical records of 24 elderly patients with this condition to determine patient age, gender, comorbid disease, laboratory findings, wound location, bacteriology, and treatment outcomes.\nRESULTS: In the examined population, necrotizing STIs developed primarily from pressure ulcers over the sacrum. Dementia and diabetes mellitus were also frequently observed in patients with necrotizing STIs. The average Laboratory Risk Indicator for Necrotizing Fasciitis (LRINEC) score was relatively low. Bacterial cultures from the debrided deep tissues exhibited mixed infections of gram-positive cocci and gram-negative bacilli, except 1 case. Anaerobic pathogens were isolated from 18 patients (72%), and 7 patients (29%) developed bacteremia. None of the cases were preceded by wounds dominated by granulation tissue. Surgical intervention, combined with antibacterial therapy involving intravenous carbapenem or cephem, was successfully used in most cases.\nCONCLUSION: Necrotizing STIs arising from pressure ulcers are generally caused by mixed pathogens and exhibit symptoms that are milder than those of necrotizing fasciitis caused by group A Streptococcus.

        "Abstract":"OBJECTIVE: The clinical relationship between brain-derived neurotrophic factor (BDNF) and cognitive function or mild cognitive impairment (MCI) is not well-understood. The purpose of this study was to identify the relationship between serum BDNF and cognitive function and MCI, and determine whether serum BDNF level might be a useful biomarker for assessing risk for MCI in older people.\nMATERIALS AND METHODS: A total of 4463 individuals aged 65 years or older (mean age 72 years) participating in the study. We measured performance in a battery of neuropsychological and cognitive function tests; serum BDNF concentration.\nRESULTS: Eight hundred twenty-seven participants (18.8%) had MCI. After adjustment for sex, age, education level, diabetes, and current smoking, serum BDNF was associated with poorer performance in the story memory, and digit symbol substitution task scores. Serum BDNF was marginally associated with the presence of MCI (odds ratio, 95% confidence interval: 1.41, 1.00-1.99) when BDNF was 1.5 SD lower than the mean value standardized for sex and age, education level, diabetes, and current smoking.\nCONCLUSION: Low serum BDNF was associated with lower cognitive test scores and MCI. Future prospective studies should establish the discriminative value of serum BDNF for the risk of MCI.\n",

        "Abstract":"Huntington's disease (HD) is an inherited, dominant neurodegenerative disorder caused by an abnormal expansion of CAG triplets in the huntingtin gene (htt). Despite extensive efforts to modify the progression of HD thus far only symptomatic treatment is available. Recent work suggests that treating invertebrate and mice HD models with metformin, a well-known AMPK activator which is used worldwide to treat type 2-diabetes, reduces mutant huntingtin from cells and alleviates many of the phenotypes associated to HD. Herein we report statistical analyses of a sample population of participants in the Enroll-HD database, a world-wide observational study on HD, to assess the effect of metformin intake in HD patients respect to cognitive status using linear models. This cross-sectional study shows for the first time that the use of metformin associates with better cognitive function in HD patients.\n",

        "Abstract":"Dementia is becoming increasingly common in western societies and carries with it a substantial clinical, social and economic burden. It is now well established that type 2 diabetes is a risk factor for dementia and it is likely that this association has a multifactorial aetiology. There is a relative paucity of data on interventions to improve cognitive function in people with type 2 diabetes. Two small randomized controlled trials have suggested that better glycaemic control, over a relatively short time period, can improve or prevent decline in cognitive function. There is also increasing interest in the link between intracerebral insulin and cognitive impairment. Several studies have suggested that relative and\/or absolute deficiency of insulin may occur in Alzheimer's dementia and, although one small randomized trial was essentially negative, randomized trials are currently underway to investigate the impact of thiazolidinediones on cognitive function in dementia. The hypothalamic-pituitary-adrenal axis is also activated in people with type 2 diabetes and there are data linking increased cortisol concentrations with cognitive impairment. Inhibition of the 11 beta-hydroxysteroid dehydrogenase type 1 enzyme, which generates cortisol from inactive cortisone in many tissues including the brain, is an attractive therapeutic target to enhance cognition. Large-scale epidemiological and intervention studies are now underway, which should enhance our understanding and management of cognitive impairment in type 2 diabetes. [References: 66]\n",

        "Abstract":"Transient global amnesia (AGT) is a well-defined syndrome of unknown aetiology. It is generally believed to be of vascular origin. Other theories suggest epilepsy or migraine as the cause. We studied the clinical features and associated risk factors in 24 patients with AGT, comparing them with two control groups with 24 people in each group, paired for age and sex. The first control group contained healthy individuals (CN) and the second patients with transient ischaemic attacks (AIT). Of the patients with AGT, 70% were women and 30% men. Their average age was 60 (range 14-76). The attacks were abrupt in onset in 100%. In 8% there was a recognisable trigger factor (driving, physical exercise, etc). The average duration was 7 hours. On study of the cardiovascular risk factors, it was found that 36% were hypertensive, 24% had cardiopathy, 12% had diabetes mellitus, 8% were smokers, 4% had polycythaemia, 16% had hyperlipidaemia, 4% were alcoholics. There was a history of migraine in 29%. No patient had a past history of epilepsy. Further investigation showed ECG changes in 12%. In 24% there were non-specific changes in the EEG. On cerebral CT scan there were lesions compatible with ischaemia in 12.5% of the patients. Levels of arterial hypertension were significantly higher in the AGT group as compared to the normal control group (Odds ratio 7.86; CI. 1.29-11.38). A past history of migraine was seen to be a risk factor associated with AGT as compared with both groups of controls (AGT\/CN Odds ratio 9.47; CI 1.01-444.92; AGT\/AIT Odds ratio > 1.72).\n",

        "Abstract":"INTRODUCTION: Metabolic syndrome (MetS) and smoking have been identified as risk factors for chronic kidney disease (CKD) in cross-sectional studies in various age groups, but longitudinal data on progression of CKD in older adults are limited. Our objectives were to examine whether MetS and its components and smoking predict the onset of CKD stage 3b (CKD-3b) in older adults.\nMETHODS: A subset of participants of the Einstein Aging Study who were free of diabetes, dementia, and CKD-3b at enrollment were included in this analysis. CKD-3b was defined as an estimated glomerular filtration rate <45 ml\/min\/1.73 m(2). Cox proportional hazards models were used in these analyses.\nRESULTS: In total, 413 >=70-year-old individuals were eligible for this study. 65.4% were female and 26.6% were black. 22.3% of the participants had MetS at baseline, 4.4% were active smokers, and 6.1% developed CKD-3b over a mean of 4 years of follow-up. MetS and smoking independently predicted incident CKD in our fully adjusted model (hazard ratio 3.65, 95% CI 1.20-10.60, p = 0.022; hazard ratio 29.69, 95% CI 4.47-197.23, p = 0.000).\nCONCLUSION: MetS and smoking are associated with an increased incidence of CKD-3b. These risk factors are modifiable, easily identified and prevented through better health care practice and early diagnosis.\n",

        "Abstract":"BACKGROUND: There is growing evidence that vascular risk factors (VRF) contribute to cognitive decline. Whether their treatment can slow down the progression of Alzheimer disease (AD) remains unsettled. The aim of this observational study was to evaluate whether the treatment of VRF is associated with a slower cognitive decline in patients who have AD without cerebrovascular disease (CVD).\nMETHODS: We recruited 301 consecutive patients who had AD without CVD (mean age 71.7 years; 69.4% women; first Mini-Mental State Examination [MMSE] mean score 21.6; mean follow-up 2.3 years), who had attended a memory clinic between 1997 and 2003. VRF sought were high blood pressure, dyslipidemia, diabetes mellitus, tobacco smoking, and atherosclerotic disease. Only 21 patients (7.0%) had no VRF. Others were classified as having no VRF treated (n = 72; 25.7%), some VRF treated (n = 119; 42.5%), or all VRF treated (n = 89; 31.8%). We compared MMSE progression over time among these 3 groups using a mixed random effects regression model.\nRESULTS: Baseline MMSE scores were similar in the 3 groups. With adjustment for confounding factors, MMSE progression over time differed significantly between groups (p = 0.002). Patients with all their VRF treated declined less than those with none of their VRF treated. Those with some VRF treated tended to have an intermediate decline.\nCONCLUSIONS: In patients who have Alzheimer disease without CVD, treatment of vascular risk factors (VRF) is associated with a slower decline in Mini-Mental State Examination score. Randomized controlled trials are needed to confirm this association, but our data suggest that dementia should not prevent treatment of VRF.\n",

        "Abstract":"The impact of dental amalgam on the development of Parkinson's disease (PD) is still uncertain, although a positive association between dental amalgam and PD has been found in a few case-control studies. The patients with amalgam fillings restored between 2000 and 2008 were identified by using the National Health Insurance Research Database (NHIRD) in Taiwan. The same number of patients who had no new amalgam filling restored was matched by sex, age, and treatment date. Both cohorts were followed up from the treatment date until the date of diagnosis of PD, death, or the end of the year 2008. The individuals who received amalgam fillings had a significantly higher risk of PD afterward (adjusted hazard ratio [HR]=1.583, 95% confidence interval [CI]=1.122-2.234, p=0.0089) than those who did not. In the individuals who received amalgam fillings, being diagnosed with diabetes or hyperlipidemia demonstrated a significantly lower HR of PD occurrence than in the patients without diabetes or hyperlipidemia (HR=0.449, 95% CI=0.254-0.794, p=0.0059; HR=0.445, 95% CI=0.260-0.763, p=0.0032) after adjusting for comorbidities and Charlson-Deyo Comorbidity Index (CCI) scores. Meanwhile, hypertension increased the hazard risk of PD (HR=1.645, 95% CI=1.098-2.464, p=0.0159). The patients exposed to dental amalgam fillings were 1.583 times more likely to have PD afterward compared to their non-exposed counterparts after adjusting for comorbidities and CCI scores.\n",

The aim of this systematic review was to assess the evidence for the treatment of hypertension in older people with dementia. Medline, EMBASE, Cochrane Library and the national research register archives were searched. Inclusion criteria were: randomised controlled trial of hypertension treatment, included participants aged 65+ years, participants had a diagnosis of dementia (global cognitive decline for at least 6 months affecting daily function), and the study assessed cognitive outcomes using validated tools. Dementia prevention studies and poor quality studies were excluded. The initial search revealed 1178 papers of potential interest, of which 24 were selected for review and six met the full inclusion criteria. Trials included people with mild-to-moderate but not severe dementia; exclusion criteria for the trials were extensive. Four trials were placebo-controlled RCTs; the remaining two compared different antihypertensives. All trials reported MMSE scores at baseline and follow-up; four reported blood pressure changes at follow-up; and only three reported cardiovascular morbidity or mortality at follow-up. Only one of four placebo-controlled studies showed evidence of blood pressure reduction, but no clear evidence for benefit (or harm) from antihypertensives on cognition, physical function or other cardiovascular outcomes. We found no evidence to confirm or refute the hypothesis that treatment of hypertension in people with dementia leads to overall health benefit.\n",

They were randomly divided into 3 groups: the control group, the strength group and the mitigation group with 30 cases in each group. In the control group, patients were only treated with diet and exercise while in the strength group patients were treated with oral hypoglycemic medications, subcutaneous insulin infusion or continuous infusion by micropump. Blood glucose level in the strength group patients was stabilized within 1 month (pre-meal <= 7.0 mmol\/L, 2 hours post-meal glucose <= 12.0 mmol\/L and glycosylated hemoglobin or HbA1c <= 7.0%). Personalized treatment programs were adopted for the mitigation group and the objective was to control the pre-meal blood glucose at <= 10.0 mmol\/L (within 3 to 6 months) and also to control 2 hours post-meal blood glucose at <= 20.0 mmol\/L (within 3 to 6 months). We compared the occurrence rate of diabetic complications, occurrence rate of new-onset dementia and progressive rate of dementia.\nRESULTS: Our results showed that target glucose rate in the mitigation group was significantly higher than that in the strength group. The occurrence rate of diabetic complications in the mitigation group was significantly lower than that observed in the other two groups. Occurrence rate of diabetic hyperosmolar coma was significantly higher in the control group, the occurrence rate of hypoglycemia was meaningfully lower in the strength group and the occurrence rate of new-onset target-organ injury was considerably higher in the mitigation group. The occurrence rate of new-onset dementia and progressive rate of dementia in mitigation group was significantly lower than those in other two groups. Comparison between the control group and the strength group did not reveal any statistical significance (p > 0.05). In the meantime, the survival time in mitigation group was significantly longer.\nCONCLUSIONS: Elderly patients with T2DM combined with AD may benefit more from the moderate control of blood glucose and a proper increase of the target value.\n",

Explanations for this could be stigmatisation, treatment with a palliative approach, and the result of the disease process.\nAIM: To ascertain whether patients with dementia are treated differently, the index diseases of hypertension, diabetes, and hyperlipidaemia were used to measure care.\nDESIGN OF STUDY: Retrospective matched control study.\nSETTING: German general practice.\nMETHOD: Sixteen GP practices recruited all their patients with dementia and at least one of the index diseases. Patients without dementia but only the index diseases were matched for age, sex, index disease, and practice, resulting in 216 pairs of patients with and without dementia. From the files, blood pressure, blood sugar\/glycated haemoglobin, cholesterol, the dates of measurement, the number of doctor-patient contacts, and the prescribed medication to treat the three conditions under scrutiny were documented. For analysis, t-tests and chi(2)-tests were used.\nRESULTS: No differences were found in treatment outcomes between the two patients groups, except one significant difference: one of the two documented systolic blood pressure values is lower in the dementia group. Furthermore, patients with dementia more often do not receive any medication or are treated with low-priced medications for hypertension (nearly significant).\nCONCLUSION: GPs do not seem to treat patients with dementia differently. The use of lower-priced antihypertensive medication could be the only indication for some kind of difference in approach.\n",

For example, 76% of patients with vascular dementia and 57% of those with vascular cognitive impairment without dementia had a history of stroke, compared with only 5% of those with probable Alzheimer disease and 7% of those with no cognitive loss. (For hypertension, the comparable figures are 55%, 48%, 24%, and 38%, respectively.) Potential undertreatment of vascular risk factors had little effect on mean control of vascular risk factors. For example, the mean (+\/- SD) systolic blood pressure in those being treated was 144 +\/- 26 mm Hg, compared with 142 +\/- 25 mm Hg in those not receiving pharmacological treatment. In each group (treated vs untreated), the proportion of patients with a systolic blood pressure higher than 160 mm Hg was 20% and 16%, respectively. Potential undertreatment occurred most often in those with severe dementia and those living in nursing homes.\nCONCLUSIONS: Vascular risk factors occurred more commonly in patients with vascular cognitive impairment compared with other patients, including those with other forms of dementia. When present, such risk factors were often treated pharmacologically, except in patients with severe dementia and those in long-term care institutions. Undertreatment does not, in general, result in worsened risk factor control.\n",

Dietary information was collected via a food frequency questionnaire. Total brain volume (TBV), total gray matter volume (TGMV), total white matter volume (TWMV), mean cortical thickness (mCT), and regional volume or CT were derived from MRI scans using FreeSurfer program. We examined the association of MeDi (scored as 0-9) and individual food groups with brain volume and thickness using regression models adjusted for age, sex, ethnicity, education, body mass index, diabetes, and cognition.\nRESULTS: Compared to lower MeDi adherence (0-4), higher adherence (5-9) was associated with 13.11 (p = 0.007), 5.00 (p = 0.05), and 6.41 (p = 0.05) milliliter larger TBV, TGMV, and TWMV, respectively. Higher fish (b = 7.06, p = 0.006) and lower meat (b = 8.42, p = 0.002) intakes were associated with larger TGMV. Lower meat intake was also associated with larger TBV (b = 12.20, p = 0.02). Higher fish intake was associated with 0.019 mm (p = 0.03) larger mCT. Volumes of cingulate cortex, parietal lobe, temporal lobe, and hippocampus and CT of the superior-frontal region were associated with the dietary factors.\nCONCLUSIONS: Among older adults, MeDi adherence was associated with less brain atrophy, with an effect similar to 5 years of aging. Higher fish and lower meat intake might be the 2 key food elements that contribute to the benefits of MeDi on brain structure. Copyright © 2015 American Academy of Neurology.\n",

We analyzed the reasons for stroke patients' and physician's nonadherence.\nMETHODS: In this prospective, observational, single-center cohort study, consecutive patients diagnosed with acute ischemic stroke or transient ischemic attack (TIA) and AF presenting during a nine-month period were included. Adherence to OAC was evaluated at 15 +\/- 1 months after the event using a semi-structured telephone interview. In patients without anticoagulation, the primary care physician (PCP) was contacted to explore the reason. Associations between nonadherence to OAC therapy at follow-up and potential predictors were assessed by logistic regression analysis.\nRESULTS: Of the 1,049 presenting stroke\/TIA patients, 139 with a first (n = 101) or a continued recommendation (n = 38) of OAC were analyzed. After 15 months, 54 patients (39% of 85 patients with OAC at follow-up) were nonadherent. The main reasons for patients' nonadherence were fear of side effects (e.g., bleeding) and inconvenience of regular international normalized ratio measurements. In two-thirds (36\/54) of cases, OAC was not prescribed by the PCP; the most important reasons were a putative high risk of falling and dementia. Risk factors for nonadherence were dementia, living in a nursing home, and the noninitiation of OAC during in-hospital stay. Treatment was temporarily discontinued in 21 (25%) of patients on OAC at follow-up.\nCONCLUSION: Nonadherence to OAC in stroke patients results from fear of potential complications or inconvenience and physicians' concerns regarding functional status. OAC should be initiated wherever possible during the in-hospital stay. Copyright © 2015 S. Karger AG, Basel.\n",

Controversy exists regarding the possible impact of intraoperative control of blood pressure upon acute (delirium) and long term (dementia) cognitive decline. We explored possible associations between perioperative hemodynamic changes, use of vasopressor drugs, risk of delirium and risk of new-onset dementia.\nMETHODS: Prospective follow-up study of 696 hip fracture patients, assessed for delirium pre- and postoperatively, using the Confusion Assessment Method. Pre-fracture cognitive function was assessed using the Informant Questionnaire of Cognitive Decline in the Elderly and by consensus diagnosis. The presence of new-onset dementia was determined at follow-up evaluation at six or twelve months after surgery. Blood pressure was recorded at admission, perioperatively and postoperatively.\nRESULTS: Preoperative delirium was present in 149 of 536 (28%) assessable patients, and 124 of 387 (32%) developed delirium postoperatively (incident delirium). The following risk factors for incident delirium in patients without pre-fracture cognitive impairment were identified: low body mass index, low level of functioning, severity of physical illness, and receipt of >= 2 blood transfusions. New-onset dementia was diagnosed at follow-up in 26 of 213 (12%) patients, associated with severity of physical illness, delirium, receipt of vasopressor drugs perioperatively and high mean arterial pressure postoperatively.\nCONCLUSION: Risk factors for incident delirium seem to differ according to pre-fracture cognitive status. The use of vasopressors during surgery and\/or postoperative hypertension is associated with new-onset dementia after hip fracture.\n",

During 5 years of follow-up, 193 individuals with a new diagnosis of dementia were identified, and risk-set sampling was used to randomly select five reference subjects per case matched on 5-year age categories and sex (965 matched participants), resulting in an analytical sample of 1,158.\nMEASUREMENTS: The exposure was new diagnosis of dementia. The primary outcome was change in number of current chronic medications (total, cardiovascular (blood pressure and lipid control), diabetes mellitus) at three times: 1 year before index date (preindex date), date of diagnosis of dementia or matched reference date (index date), and up to 1 year after index date or end of follow-up if censored before 1 year (postindex date).\nRESULTS: After adjustment, the number of chronic medications and the subset of cardiovascular medications declined after a dementia diagnosis in the overall cohort and in age-, sex-, and time-matched reference individuals, but the decline was significantly greater in the group with dementia (0.71 medications fewer than the reference group, P = .02). The number of diabetes mellitus medications declined in both groups, but the declines were not statistically different (0.18 medications fewer than the reference group, P = .008).\nCONCLUSIONS: Use of cardiometabolic medications fell after a diagnosis of dementia, as recommended in national guidelines. © 2016, Copyright the Authors Journal compilation © 2016, The American Geriatrics Society.\n",

Lifestyle factors, dietary habits and demographic data were compared between normal subjects and participants with dementia.\nRESULTS: A total of 10432 residents were assessed, among whom 2049 were classified as having a mild cognitive impairment (MCI), 929 were diagnosed with dementia, and 7035 were without dementia or MCI. After adjustment for age, gender, education, body mass index (BMI), dietary habits, habitual exercises and co-morbidities, including hypertension, diabetes and cerebrovascular diseases, we found inverse associations of dementia with the consumption of fish (OR 0.62, 95% CI 0.41-0.94), vegetables (OR 0.35, 95% CI 0.13-0.95), coffee (OR 0.59, 95% CI 0.35-0.97), green tea (OR 0.51, 95% CI 0.34-0.75) and other types of tea (OR 0.41, 95% CI 0.28-0.60). There was no association between dementia and fruit consumption. Compared with people who had a normal BMI (18 < BMI <= 24), older overweight people (24 < BMI <=30) had a reduced risk of dementia with an adjusted OR of 0.77 (95% CI 0.61-0.96).\nCONCLUSIONS: Our study provides preliminary evidence that suggests that the consumption of fish, vegetables, tea, and coffee has potential benefits against dementia in East Asian population. Being modestly overweight (nadir risk at BMI = 25) in late life was associated with decreased odds of dementia. The benefit of fruits may be offset by their high sugar content.\n",

Understanding long-term trajectories in blood pressure of those who do and do not develop dementia can help clarify the issue. The Honolulu Heart Program\/Honolulu-Asia Aging Study followed a cohort of Japanese American men for an average of 32 years, with systolic BP (SBP) and diastolic BP (DBP) measured at 6 examinations and dementia assessed at the final 3. In an analysis of 1890 men who completed all 6 of the exams, 112 diagnosed with incident dementia at examination 6 were compared with the 1778 survivors without dementia. Trajectories in SBP and DBP up to and including the sixth examination were estimated with a repeated-measures analysis using 3 splines. From midlife to late life, men who went on to develop dementia had an additional age-adjusted increase in SBP of 0.26 mm Hg (95% CI: 0.01 to 0.51 mm Hg) per year compared with survivors without dementia. Over the late-life examinations, this group had an additional age-adjusted decline in SBP of 1.36 mm Hg (95% CI: 0.64 to 2.07 mm Hg) per year. These associations were strongest for vascular dementia and were reduced substantially in men who were previously taking antihypertensive medication. Similar changes in diastolic BP were observed, but only for vascular dementia, and the findings were not modified by antihypertensive treatment. Over a 32-year period, compared with men who did not, those who did develop dementia had a greater increase, followed by a greater decrease, in SBP. Both of these trends are modified by antihypertensive therapy.\n",

        "Abstract":"BACKGROUND AND OBJECTIVE: Vascular risk factors (VRF) are associated with a higher incidence of dementia. However, the relationship with disease progression is unclear. This review examined the association of VRF (hypertension, hypercholesterolemia, diabetes mellitus, overweight, smoking or multiple VRF) and cognitive decline in patients suffering from dementia.\nMETHODS: Literature was searched in four databases (Pubmed, Embase, Cochrane, PsychInfo) and 1779 articles were identified. This resulted in a total of 20 articles which were included.\nRESULTS: Twelve studies on hypertension (HT) were inconsistent about the association with cognitive decline. For hypercholesterolemia (HC) 2 (out of 7) studies were associated with increased cognitive decline, as were both (2\/2) studies which researched LDL-cholesterol. Articles were inconclusive about the effect of diabetes mellitus (DM): five (out of 13) found less cognitive decline, 2 found more cognitive decline, and 6 found no significant effect of DM. Overweight (BMI>25 kg\/m(2)) was associated in 2\/4 studies with a slower rate of cognitive decline, while the other 2 studies found no effect. All studies (5\/5) that researched smoking did not find a significant effect. Four studies (out of 7) that looked at multiple VRF found faster cognitive decline, and 3\/7 found no effect.\nDISCUSSION: The results of this review suggest an association between LDL-cholesterol and the progression of dementia, while inconsistent results were found for other VRF. Additional prospective cohort studies and experimental studies should be performed to better understand the causal contribution of VRF on cognitive decline in dementia.

Clinical course has been documented by serial history taking and interviews and neurological, medical, and psychological examinations, and correlated with measurements of cerebral blood flow. The clinical course and cognitive performance have been compared with those of age-matched normal volunteers and patients with Alzheimer's disease. Patients with MID were subdivided into hypertensive and normotensive groups, and also into those displaying stabilized or improved cognition and those whose condition deteriorated. Among hypertensive patients with MID, improved cognition and clinical course correlated with control of systolic blood pressure within upper limits of normal (135 to 150 mm Hg), but if systolic blood pressure was reduced below this level, patients with MID deteriorated. Among normotensive patients with MID, improved cognition was associated with cessation of smoking cigarettes.\n",

        "Abstract":"Many patients with diabetes are at increased risk of cognitive dysfunction and dementia. Diabetes mellitus is a vascular risk factor that may increase the risk of dementia through its associations with vascular dementia. We tested whether cognitive impairment could be exacerbated in combined injury using a rat model of chronic cerebral hypoperfusion with diabetes. We also determined whether a potent inhibitor of type III phosphodiesterase could prevent the cognitive decline caused by this combined injury. We used Otsuka Long-Evans Tokushima Fatty (OLETF) rats as a model of type II diabetes (T2DM) and Long-Evans Tokushima Otsuka (LETO) rats as a control. Chronic cerebral hypoperfusion was modeled by permanent bilateral common carotid artery occlusion (BCCAO). At 24weeks, the non-diabetic and T2DM rats were randomly assigned into groups for the following experiments: analysis I (1) sham non-diabetic rats (n=8); (2) hypoperfused non-diabetic rats (n=9); (3) sham T2DM rats (n=8); (4) hypoperfused T2DM rats (n=9); analysis II- (1) sham T2DM rats without treatment (n=8); (2) cilostazol-treated T2DM rats (n=8); (3) hypoperfused T2DM rats (n=9); and (4) hypoperfused T2DM rats and cilostazol treatment (n=9). The rats were orally administered cilostazol (50mg\/kg) or vehicle once a day for 2weeks after 24weeks. Rats performed Morris water maze tasks, and neuronal cell death and neuroinflammation were investigated via Western blots and histological investigation. Spatial memory impairment was exacerbated synergistically in the hypoperfused T2DM group compared with the hypoperfused non-diabetic group and sham T2DBM group (P<0.05). Compared with the control group, neuronal cell death was increased in the hippocampus of the hypoperfused T2DM group. Cilostazol, a PDE-3 inhibitor, improved the memory impairments through inhibition of neuronal cell death, activation of CREB phosphorylation and BDNF expression in the hypoperfused T2DM group. Our experimental results support the hypothesis that there are deleterious interactions between chronic cerebral hypoperfusion and T2DM. That is, metabolic diseases such as diabetes may exacerbate cognitive impairment in a rat model of vascular dementia. We also suggest that surprisingly, the phosphodiesterase III inhibitor, cilostazol may be useful for the treatment of cognitive impairment in diabetes mellitus-induced dementia. In conclusion, diabetes can aggravate cognitive dysfunction in vascular dementia, and PDE-3 inhibitors, such as cilostazol, may form the basis of a novel therapeutic strategy for diabetes-associated cognitive impairment or vascular dementia.

We abstracted 13 months of primary care medical records to delineate quality of care provided by physicians and whether there was value added from the nurse care manager model.\nSETTING: Dual eligible Evercare SNP located in central Florida.\nPARTICIPANTS: Two-hundred thirty-one vulnerable older enrollees in the SNP who had complex disease.\nRESULTS: Based on physician medical records alone, the 231 high-risk participants (mean age 77, 67% women) received recommended care for 53% of 5,569 evaluated clinical circumstances, ranging from 12% for end-of-life care to 78% for diabetes mellitus. In fewer than 40% of these clinical circumstances was recommended care provided for dementia, falls, and urinary incontinence. In a second analysis accounting for care provided by both the Evercare nurse and the physician, recommended care was provided to patients in 69% of the 5,684 evaluated clinical circumstances.\nCONCLUSION: Comprehensive quality measurement applied to vulnerable older adults enrolled in one mature SNP showed that the Evercare nurse model addresses important deficits in physician care for geriatric conditions. Such measurement should be applied to other SNP models and to compare SNP care with that for complex, older, fee-for-service Medicare cohorts. © 2011, Copyright the Authors Journal compilation © 2011, The American Geriatrics Society.\n",

The Clinical Dementia Rating (CDR) Scale and Mini-Mental State Examination (MMSE) were administered at each visit. Baseline vascular factors were determined by interview and physical examination. Generalized least-squares random-effects regression was performed with CDR Sum of Boxes (CDR-Sum) or MMSE as the outcome, and vascular index or individual vascular factors as independent variables.\nRESULTS: Atrial fibrillation, systolic hypertension, and angina were associated with more rapid decline on both the CDR-Sum and MMSE, while history of coronary artery bypass graft surgery, diabetes, and antihypertensive medications were associated with a slower rate of decline. There was an age interaction such that systolic hypertension, angina, and myocardial infarction were associated with greater decline with increasing baseline age.\nCONCLUSION: Atrial fibrillation, hypertension, and angina were associated with a greater rate of decline and may represent modifiable risk factors for secondary prevention in Alzheimer disease. The attenuated decline for diabetes and coronary artery bypass graft surgery may be due to selective survival. Some of these effects appear to vary with age.\n",

        "Abstract":"Vascular dementia (VD) is the second most common cause of dementia in the elderly after Alzheimer's disease (AD). Prevalence estimates from community surveys indicate that, on average, 5% of persons over 65 and 15 to 20% of people over 80 suffer from \"severe dementia\". Clinico-pathological studies have shown that AD accounts for 50 to 60% of the cases and VD for about 10 to 20%; 20% of the patients have both disorders. The incidence rate of VD ranges from 7 per 1,000 person-years in normal volunteers to 16 per 1,000 person-years in subjects with risk factors for strokes, particularly high blood pressure. The only effective therapeutic approach to VD is the prevention of strokes, mainly through the treatment of hypertension; however, none of the therapeutic trials has included VD prevention as one of its treatment goals. Syst-Eur Study is a European placebo controlled trial which aims to determine whether morbidity and mortality are changed when elderly patients (60 years and over) with isolated systolic hypertension are treated. In this trial, the incidence of VD will be carefully recorded during the five year follow-up of the expected 3,000 patients. The present side project to the Syst-Eur trial will specifically address the following questions: does antihypertensive treatment reduce the incidence of VD?, and how do the cognitive functions of elderly patients change when treated with active or placebo treatment? The protocol is based on the administration of the MMS (Folstein) once a year to all patients. If the MMS score is 23 or less, a set of criteria will be used to establish the diagnosis of vascular dementia. A pilot study has demonstrated the feasibility of the trial. The main study is in progress.\n",

Preexisting dementia was defined as any type of dementia that was present prior to the index stroke case. Palliative patients were excluded. Demographic information, clinical presentation, selected process measures (e.g., thrombolysis, admission to stroke unit, carotid imaging, stroke prevention), pneumonia, death, disability, and disposition at discharge were analyzed.\nRESULTS: Among 9,304 eligible patients with an acute ischemic stroke, 702 (9.1%) had a history of dementia. Patients with dementia were older (mean age 81 vs 70 years; p < 0.001), had more severe strokes (Canadian Neurological Scale score <4, 20.7% vs 10.5%; p < 0.001), and were more likely to have atrial fibrillation (22.8% vs 15.3%; p < 0.001) than those without dementia.

Drug exposure is often presumed from health insurance claims but this may not correspond exactly to what subjects actually take. This study was designed to investigate French reimbursement databases in assessing drug use.\nMETHODS: Between 1999 and 2001, 9294 subjects were included in the Three-City (3C) Study, a French cohort studying the relationship between vascular risk factors and dementia. Of these, 4112 subjects had data available from both clinical interviews and the reimbursement databases of the French national health insurance system. Agreement between drugs reported as used at interview and drugs reimbursed during the previous 30 or 60 days was measured with kappa coefficients. Using calculations of sensitivity (Se), specificity (Sp), positive predictive values (PPVs) and negative predictive values (NPVs), the validity of reimbursement data for the 30 or 60 days preceding the interview was investigated taking drugs reported at interview as the 'gold standard'.\nRESULTS: Declared drug use at interview was less well predicted by 30-day than by 60-day reimbursement data. Agreement between reimbursement data and interviews as well as validity of reimbursement data with reference to interviews were substantial for drugs used in cardiovascular diseases, diabetes, rheumatic disorders or neuropsychiatric conditions and were poor for laxatives, vitamins, vasculoprotectives, first and second line analgesics, anti-infective products or dermatologicals.\nCONCLUSIONS: Reimbursement data with an appropriate time frame and interviews estimate exposure to chronically used drugs similarly. Self-medication was better described with interviews whereas reimbursement data seem more useful for drugs used topically or intermittently.\n",

        "Title":"The treatment of hypertension in people with dementia: a systematic review of observational studies",
        "Abstract":"BACKGROUND: Hypertension is very common in older people and a number of trials of antihypertensives have demonstrated benefit from treatment in even the oldest old. However, people with dementia were significantly under-represented in these studies and as a population are more likely to be physically frail, to suffer orthostatic hypotension and to experience adverse effects from polypharmacy at a lower drug count. It may be that different thresholds for commencement and cessation of treatment should be considered and may already be used for this group. Against this background this review sets out to describe the prevalence of hypertension in people with dementia, its treatment, change in treatment over time and the achievement of blood pressure (BP) control.\nMETHODS: The PubMed, Cochrane, Embase and PsychINFO databases were searched for observational studies involving people with dementia and a diagnosis of hypertension. The search was limited to English language articles involving adults and humans published from 1990 onwards. Abstracts and titles were then reviewed with eligible articles read in full. Bibliographies were examined for further relevant studies. The final selection of studies was then analysed and appraised.\nRESULTS: Thirteen articles were identified for analysis. The prevalence of hypertension in people with dementia was 45% (range 35%-84%). 73% of these were on at least one antihypertensive, with diuretics being the most common. The reported prevalence of hypertension in study populations remained unchanged over time. ACEi\/ARBs and calcium channel blockers were prescribed more frequently in more recent studies whilst use of beta-blockers and diuretics remained unchanged. Target blood pressure was achieved in 55% of those on treatment.\nCONCLUSION: Hypertension is as common in people with dementia as in other populations and is as commonly treated with antihypertensive drugs. The findings presented here will support further work to establish the risk-benefit of antihypertensive treatment in patients with dementia and, if differing ratios are identified, to establish dementia-specific guidelines for management.\n",

        "Abstract":"Epidemiological data associate hypertension with a predisposition to Alzheimer's disease (AD), and a number of postmortem and in vivo studies also demonstrate that hypertension increases amyloid-beta (Abeta) pathology. In contrast, anti-hypertensive medications reportedly improve cognition and decrease the risk of AD, while certain classes of anti-hypertensive drugs are associated with decreased AD-related pathology. We investigated the effects of hypertension and anti-hypertensive treatment on Abeta plaque load in postmortem frontal cortex in AD. Abeta load was significantly increased in hypertensive (n = 20) relative to normotensive cases (n = 62) and was also significantly higher in treated (n = 9) than untreated hypertensives (n = 11). We then looked into mechanisms by which hypertension and treatment might increase Abeta load, focusing on Abeta-synthesizing enzymes, beta- and gamma-secretase, and Abeta-degrading enzymes, angiotensin-converting enzyme (ACE), insulin-degrading enzyme (IDE) and neprilysin. ACE and IDE protein levels were significantly lower in hypertensive (n = 21) than normotensive cases (n = 64), perhaps translating to decreased Abeta catabolism in hypertensives. ACE level was significantly higher in treated (n = 9) than untreated hypertensives (n = 12), possibly reflecting feedback upregulation of the renin-angiotensin system. Prospective studies in larger cohorts stratified according to anti-hypertensive drug class are needed to confirm these initial findings and to elucidate the interactions between hypertension, anti-hypertensive treatments, and Abeta metabolism.\n",

        "Abstract":"BACKGROUND: According to international recommendations [from the American College of Cardiology\/American Heart Association\/European Society of Cardiology] and those of the Haute Autorite de Sante (HAS) in France, treatment with a vitamin K antagonist is recommended in patients with atrial fibrillation (AF) in the presence of a high thromboembolic risk factor [history of stroke, transient ischemic attack, systemic embolism, or valvular heart disease, or presence of a mechanical heart valve prosthesis] or at least two moderate risk factors (age >=75 years, hypertension, congestive heart failure, or diabetes). In patients with a major contraindication, the vitamin K antagonist can be replaced by an antiplatelet agent (APA). These recommendations are not systematically observed in patients with Alzheimer disease (AD). The aim of our study was to determine the factors associated with undertreatment of AF in geriatric outpatients with AD.\nMETHODS: Use of oral anticoagulants or APAs was studied in 66 patients with AF who were included in the French Network on Alzheimer Disease (REAL.FR) cohort, consisting of 686 outpatients living at home, supported by an informal caregiver, and suffering from Alzheimer-type dementia, with a Mini Mental Status Examination (MMSE) score between 10 and 26. First, demographic characteristics (age, sex, body mass index [BMI], living arrangements, educational level), medical conditions (comorbidity, number of medications), disability (activities of daily living [ADL], instrumental activities of daily living [IADL]), risk of falls (one-leg balance test), cognitive status (according to MMSE, Alzheimer's Disease Assessment Scale-Cognitive Subscale [ADAS-Cog], and Clinical Dementia Rating [CDR] scores), risk factors for stroke (hypertension, history of stroke, congestive heart failure, diabetes, or age >=75 years) and potential contraindications to oral anticoagulants (OACs) or APAs (polypharmacy, risk of falls, renal failure, gastrointestinal diseases) of patients receiving OACs were compared with those of patients receiving APAs and those of patients receiving no treatment for AF. Then the same characteristics were compared between patients receiving no treatment for AF and those receiving OACs or APAs.\nRESULTS: Only 56 % (n = 37) of patients with AF were receiving OACs or APAs at the baseline visit, of whom 18 (49 %) were receiving OACs and 19 (51 %) were receiving APAs. Bivariate analysis showed that patients receiving OACs or APAs were significantly more likely to have a history of cardiovascular disease (p = 0.005)-in particular, hypertension (p = 0.037)-less likely to be living alone and unaided (p = 0.038), and less likely to be taking nonsteroidal anti-inflammatory drugs [NSAIDs] (p = 0.001).\nCONCLUSION: Despite the national and international recommendations, nearly half of AD patients with AF do not receive OACs or APAs. A history of cardiovascular disease-in particular, hypertension-improves access to treatment, but use of NSAIDs and living alone without home care seem to be the main factors associated with non-prescription of OACs or APAs.\n",

        "Abstract":"A 61-year old man with a history of arterial hypertension suffered a left HZO, and was treated with acyclovir. Three weeks later he suddenly developed moderate left hemiparesis particularly of the leg, severe paresis of the right leg, aphasia and somnolence. Treated with IV acyclovir and high-dose corticosteroids deterioration of the right hemiparesis was apparent. Serological and CSF-studies showed acute varicella-zoster virus infection with intrathecal antibody synthesis (antibody specificity index 2.7). On the third day CT scan revealed infarctions in the territory of both anterior cerebral arteries, at the fifth day additionally left striatocapsular infarction. Selective carotid arteriogram showed bilateral occlusions of anterior cerebral arteries in their proximal segment. With a mean delay of seven weeks granulomatous vasculitis is a rare complication of HZO, leading commonly to ischemic infarctions in the region of the middle cerebral artery. Trigeminovascular connections are the probable pathway of virus-transmission from the trigeminal nerve to ipsilateral branches of the circle of Willis. Because of the presumed pathogenesis immediate therapy with high-dose corticosteroids and acyclovir is justified.\n",

        "Abstract":"Hypertension has been suspected of being associated with Alzheimer disease (AD). To study this problem, a case-control study investigating the association between hypertension and cognitive decline was conducted as a secondary analysis of data from more than 700 patients diagnosed with AD who had been randomly assigned to the placebo arm of a clinical trial. Additional analyses were undertaken to investigate the effects of baseline disease severity, age, gender, apolipoprotein genotype, and the use of antihypertensive medication in this population. This study found evidence of an association between hypertension and increased cognitive decline in AD patients over a 6-month period. After controlling for baseline disease severity, a pooled odds ratio (OR) was estimated to be 1.6 (95% confidence interval, 1.0-2.7) and found to be statistically significant (p = 0.048). Secondary analyses controlling for gender and apolipoprotein genotype showed no significant effect on the association between hypertension and cognitive decline. With regard to age, patients younger than 65 years with hypertension were more likely to have increased cognitive decline than patients of the same age without hypertension (odds ratio = 6.9, 95% confidence interval, 1.5-31.1; p = 0.005). Treatment with antihypertensives did not appear to provide protection from cognitive decline. Increased cognitive decline among those older than 65 years was comparable for hypertensive and normotensive subjects. This study, examining a large population of patients with AD, provides evidence that the rate in cognitive decline measured over a period of 6 months is accelerated by a state of hypertension in patients younger than 65 years.\n",

This study analyzed the association between HbA1c level and the incidence of all-cause dementia (ACD) and of Alzheimer's disease dementia (referred to here as AD). HbA1c levels >=6.5% were associated with 2.8-fold increased risk of incident ACD (p = 0.027) and for AD (p = 0.047). HbA1c levels >=7% were associated with a five-fold increased risk of incident ACD (p = 0.001) and 4.7-fold increased risk of incident AD (p = 0.004). The T2DM diagnosis per se did not increase the risk of either ACD or AD. Higher levels of HbA1c are associated with increased risk of ACD and AD in an elderly population. T2DM diagnosis was not associated with increased risk if HbA1c levels were below 7%.\n",

        "Abstract":"OBJECTIVE: Older adults with diabetes and dementia are at increased risk for hypoglycemia and other adverse events associated with tight glycemic control and are unlikely to experience long-term benefits. We examined risk factors for tight glycemic control in this population and use of medications associated with a high risk of hypoglycemia in the subset with tight control.\nRESEARCH DESIGN AND METHODS: This retrospective cohort study of national Veterans Affairs (VA) administrative\/clinical data and Medicare claims for fiscal years (FYs) 2008-2009 included 15,880 veterans aged >= 65 years with type 2 diabetes and dementia and prescribed antidiabetic medication. Multivariable regression analyses were used to identify sociodemographic and clinical predictors of hemoglobin A1c (HbA1c) control (tight, moderate, poor, or not monitored) and, in patients with tight control, subsequent use of medication associated with a high risk of hypoglycemia (sulfonylureas, insulin).\nRESULTS: Fifty-two percent of patients had tight glycemic control (HbA1c <7% [53 mmol\/mol]). Specific comorbidities, older age, and recent weight loss were associated with greater odds of tight versus moderate control, whereas Hispanic ethnicity and obesity were associated with lower odds of tight control. Among tightly controlled patients, 75% used sulfonylureas and\/or insulin, with higher odds in patients who were male, black, or aged >= 75 years; had a hospital or nursing home stay in FY2008; or had congestive heart failure, renal failure, or peripheral vascular disease.\nCONCLUSIONS: Many older veterans with diabetes and dementia are at high risk for hypoglycemia associated with intense diabetes treatment and may be candidates for deintensification or alteration of diabetes medications.

Cognition and weight were assessed annually.\nRESULTS: Multivariable binary logistic regression, adjusting for age, sex, race, education, length of follow-up, and modified FSRP related late-life BMI to risk of diagnostic conversion from NC to MCI or AD and from MCI to AD. Secondary analyses related late-life BMI to diagnostic conversion in the presence of rapid weight loss (>5% decrease in 12 months) and apolipoprotein E (APOE) epsilon4. During a mean 3.8-year follow-up period, 12% of NC participants converted to MCI or AD and 49% of MCI participants converted to AD. Higher baseline BMI was associated with a reduced probability of diagnostic conversion, such that for each one-unit increase in baseline BMI there was a reduction in diagnostic conversion for both NC (OR=0.977, 95%CI 0.958-0.996, p=0.015) and MCI participants (OR=0.962, 95%CI 0.942-0.983, p<0.001). The protective effect of higher baseline BMI did not persist in the setting of rapid weight loss but did persist when adjusting for APOE epsilon4.\nCONCLUSIONS: Higher late-life BMI is associated with a lower risk of incident MCI and AD but is not protective in the presence of rapid weight loss.\n",

Elevated blood pressure is presumed one of the main risk factors, although data are almost exclusively derived from cross-sectional studies. We assessed in 10 European cohorts the relation between concurrently and previously measured blood pressure levels, hypertension, its treatment, and severe cerebral white matter lesions. In total, 1805 nondemented subjects aged 65 to 75 years were sampled from ongoing community-based studies that were initiated 5 to 20 years before the MRI. White matter lesions in the periventricular and subcortical region were rated separately using semiquantitative measures. We performed logistic regression analyses adjusted for potential confounders in 1625 people with complete data. Concurrently and formerly assessed diastolic and systolic blood pressure levels were positively associated with severe white matter lesions. Both increases and decreases in diastolic blood pressure were associated with more severe periventricular white matter lesions. Increase in systolic blood pressure levels was associated with more severe periventricular and subcortical white matter lesions. People with poorly controlled hypertension had a higher risk of severe white matter lesions than those without hypertension, or those with controlled or untreated hypertension. Higher blood pressure was associated with an increased risk of severe white matter lesions. Successful treatment of hypertension may reduce this risk; however, a potential negative effect of decreasing diastolic blood pressure level on the occurrence of severe periventricular white matter lesions should be taken into account.\n",

We followed 68 outpatients with probable AD for an average of 40 months. They were divided into three groups based on no (n = 24), single (n = 27), and multiple (n = 17) vascular risk factors. We assessed longitudinal changes on the Mini-Mental State Examination, Functional Assessment Staging scores, and in rCBF deficits using repeated single photon emission computed tomography (SPECT) using N-isopropyl-p-[(123)I] iodoamphetamine. During follow-up, the multiple vascular risk factor group showed faster cognitive and functional decline than the no and single vascular risk factor groups. When compared with the initial SPECT, the follow-up SPECT showed a significant rCBF reduction in widespread regions, including the parietotemporal, frontal, and limbic lobes, in the multiple and single vascular risk factor groups, while there was rCBF reduction in small scattered regions of the temporoparietal lobe in the no vascular risk factor group. Multiple vascular risk factors are associated with a greater rate of decline in cognition, function, and rCBF in patients with AD. Our results highlight the contribution of vascular risk factors on the progression of AD.\n",

We assessed the long-term effect of antihypertensive medications on cognitive function in a community sample of African American older adults.\nMETHODS: We conducted longitudinal surveys and clinical assessment of cognitive function in a random sample of 2212 community-dwelling African Americans 65 years and older. We identified 1900 participants without evidence of cognitive impairment at baseline, 1617 of whom had subsequent follow-up information, and 946 of whom had blood pressure measurements. Cognitive function was measured at baseline and at 2 and 5 years by means of scores on the Community Screening Instrument for Dementia and neuropsychological and clinical assessment for dementia and cognitive impairment. Prescription and nonprescription medication use was derived from in-home inspection of medications and participant and informant reports.\nRESULTS: Of 1900 participants, 288 (15.2%) developed incident cognitive impairment. Using logistic regression to control for the effects of age, sex, education, baseline cognitive scores, and hypertension and angina or myocardial infarction, we found that antihypertensive medications reduced the odds of incident cognitive impairment by 38% (odds ratio, 0.62; 95% confidence interval, 0.45-0.84).

Memantine, an N-methyl-D-aspartate receptor antagonist, which is clinically applied in dementia, has been shown to exert neuroprotective effects under hypoglycemic conditions in rats.\nOBJECTIVE: We hypothesized that memantine may prevent hypoglycemia-induced decrements in the cerebral high-energy phosphate, i.e. ATP, metabolism to exert its neuroprotective action under these conditions.\nDESIGN AND PARTICIPANTS: In a randomized, double-blind crossover design, we applied memantine vs. placebo in 16 healthy male subjects and examined the cerebral high-energy phosphate metabolism by (31)phosphor magnetic resonance spectroscopy, hormonal counterregulation, and neurocognitive performance during hypoglycemic glucose clamp conditions.\nRESULTS: We found increments in hormonal counterregulation and reduced neurocognitive performance during hypoglycemia (P < 0.05). Cerebral ATP levels increased upon hypoglycemia in the memantine condition as compared with placebo (P = 0.006) and remained higher after renormalizing blood glucose concentrations (P = 0.018), which was confirmed by ATP to inorganic phosphate ratio (P = 0.046). Phosphocreatine levels and phosphocreatine to inorganic phosphate ratio remained stable throughout the experiments and did not differ between conditions (P > 0.1 for both).\nCONCLUSION: Our data demonstrate that memantine preserves the cerebral energy status during experimentally induced hypoglycemia in healthy subjects. An improved neuronal energy status may thus be involved in the neuroprotective effect under these conditions and may qualify memantine as potential future option to combat cognitive impairments and dementia in diabetes.\n",

Randomised controlled trials and observational studies were included.\nRESULTS: The pre-specified search strategy retrieved 11,992 abstract articles, and 25 papers including those identified on review of reference lists and reviews met the inclusion criteria. Of these, 11 were randomised controlled trials (RCTs) and 14 observational studies. Observational studies suggested that a VRF package and treatment of hypertension and statin therapy may be associated with improved outcome but these studies suffered from potential bias. The few RCTs performed were mostly small with short duration follow-up, and do not provide clear evidence either way.\nCONCLUSIONS: Observational data raises the possibility that treating VRF could alter the rate of decline in AD. However RCT data are not yet available to support this hypothesis and to alter clinical practice. RCTs in larger numbers of individuals with longer follow-up, ideally in the early stages of AD, are required to address this potentially important treatment question.\n",

        "Abstract":"Erectile dysfunction is common among individuals with Parkinson's disease, but it is unknown whether it precedes the onset of the classic features of Parkinson's disease. To address this question, the authors examined whether erectile dysfunction was associated with Parkinson's disease risk in the Health Professionals Follow-up Study. Analyses included 32,616 men free of Parkinson's disease at baseline in 1986 who in 2000 completed a retrospective questionnaire with questions on erectile dysfunction in different time periods. Relative risks were computed using Cox proportional hazards models adjusting for age, smoking, caffeine intake, history of diabetes, and other covariates. Among men who reported their erectile function before 1986, 200 were diagnosed with Parkinson's disease during 1986-2002. Men with erectile dysfunction before 1986 were 3.8 times more likely to develop Parkinson's disease during the follow-up than were those with very good erectile function (relative risk = 3.8, 95% confidence interval: 2.4, 6.0; p < 0.0001). Multivariate-adjusted relative risks of Parkinson's disease were 2.7, 3.7, and 4.0 (95% confidence interval: 1.4, 11.1; p = 0.008) for participants with first onset of erectile dysfunction (before 1986) at 60 or more, 50-59, and less than 50 years of age, respectively, relative to those without erectile dysfunction. In conclusion, in this retrospective analysis in a large cohort of men, the authors observed that erectile dysfunction was associated with a higher risk of developing Parkinson's disease.\n",

The aim of this study was to test the hypothesis that prestroke dementia influenced the nonprescription of OAC before stroke.\nMETHODS: This is an ancillary study of Stroke in Atrial Fibrillation Ensemble II, an observational study conducted in patients with a previously known NVAF, consecutively admitted for an acute stroke to French and Italian centers. Prestroke dementia was evaluated by the clinical physician and validated by an Informant Questionnaire for Cognitive Decline in the Elderly score of >or=104 in patients with a reliable informant.\nRESULTS: Of 204 patients, 24 patients met criteria for prestroke dementia according to GP's opinion. The only variables independently associated with OAC before stroke were follow-up by a cardiologist (adjusted OR: 3.33; 95% CI: 1.47-7.53) and a younger age of patients (adjusted OR: 0.94; 95% CI: 0.89-0.99). Variables independently associated with any antithrombotic drug therapy before stroke were follow-up by a general practitioner (adjusted OR: 2.78; 95% CI: 1.09-7.11), and by a cardiologist (adjusted OR: 3.15; 95% CI: 1.48-6.69).\nCONCLUSION: In daily practice, the under-prescription of OAC in patients with NVAF mainly depends on co-morbidity and on characteristics of the physician, not on prestroke dementia.

        "Abstract":"To investigate whether vascular risk affects the progression of Alzheimer's disease (AD), 415 AD patients aged 65 years old and over without cerebrovascular diseases were enrolled and administered with a structured interview to assess demography, vascular risk factors, and cognitive and functional status at baseline, and 324 AD patients were followed up annually for 5 years. A mixed random effects regression model was used to identify the association between vascular risk, individual vascular risk factors, and the progression of AD. After adjusting for confounding factors, AD patients with vascular risk had faster cognitive and functional decline rates than the subjects without such risk factors. Individual vascular risk factors including hypertension and diabetes mellitus, transient ischemic attack and cerebrovascular accident during the follow-up were independently associated with the progression of AD. Our findings suggest that vascular risk aggravates the progression of AD and may be involved in the etiologic process of AD. As such, control of vascular risk may slow down the progression of AD.\n",

We examined the impact of APOE genotype and midlife blood glucose on post-mortem vascular and Alzheimer's disease (AD) neuropathology. Ninety-four participants from the Framingham Heart Study without diagnosed diabetes underwent health examination at midlife and brain autopsy at death. Histopathological measures of vascular and AD neuropathology were obtained and analyzed. Results demonstrated that, among APOE e4 carriers, elevated blood glucose was associated with more severe AD pathology. There was no such relationship with vascular pathology. In a relatively healthy sample with low vascular risk burden, midlife elevated blood glucose was associated with greater AD pathology among APOE e4 carriers. A better understanding of interactive effects of APOE genotype and vascular risk on neuropathology has implications for identification of individuals at risk for decline and long-term preventive treatment.\n",

        "Abstract":"Rates of disease progression differ among patients with Alzheimer's disease, but little is known about prognostic predictors. The aim of the study was to assess whether sociodemographic factors, disease severity and duration, and vascular factors are prognostic predictors of cognitive decline in Alzheimer's disease progression. We conducted a longitudinal clinical study in a specialized clinical unit for the diagnosis and treatment of dementia in Rome, Italy. A total of 154 persons with mild to moderate Alzheimer's disease consecutively admitted to the dementia unit were included. All patients underwent extensive clinical examination by a physician at admittance and all follow-ups. We evaluated the time-dependent probability of a worsening in cognitive performance corresponding to a 5-point decrease in Mini-Mental State Examination (MMSE) score. Survival analysis was used to analyze risk of faster disease progression in relation to age, education, severity and duration of the disease, family history of dementia, hypertension, hypercholesterolemia, and type 2 diabetes. Younger and more educated persons were more likely to have faster Alzheimer's disease progression. Vascular factors such as hypertension and hypercholesterolemia were not found to be significantly associated with disease progression. However, patients with diabetes had a 65% reduced risk of fast cognitive decline compared to Alzheimer patients without diabetes. Sociodemographic factors and diabetes predict disease progression in Alzheimer's disease. Our findings suggest a slower disease progression in Alzheimer's patients with diabetes. If confirmed, this result will contribute new insights into Alzheimer's disease pathogenesis and lead to relevant suggestions for disease treatment.\n",

Baseline characteristics and antithrombotic therapy initiated at diagnosis were analysed by cohort.\nRESULTS: Baseline characteristics were similar across cohorts. Median CHA2DS2-VASc (cardiac failure, hypertension, age >=75 (doubled), diabetes, stroke (doubled)-vascular disease, age 65-74 and sex category (female)) score was 3 in all four cohorts. From C1 to C4, the proportion of patients on anticoagulant (AC) therapy increased by almost 15% (C1 57.4%; C4 71.1%). Use of vitamin K antagonist (VKA)+\/-antiplatelet (AP) (C1 53.2%; C4 34.0%) and AP monotherapy (C1 30.2%; C4 16.6%) declined, while use of non-VKA oral ACs (NOACs)+\/-AP increased (C1 4.2%; C4 37.0%). Most CHA2DS2-VASc >=2 patients received AC, and this proportion increased over time, largely driven by NOAC prescribing. NOACs were more frequently prescribed than VKAs in men, the elderly, patients of Asian ethnicity, those with dementia, or those using non-steroidal anti-inflammatory drugs, and current smokers. VKA use was more common in patients with cardiac, vascular, or renal comorbidities.\nCONCLUSIONS: Since NOACs were introduced, there has been an increase in newly diagnosed patients with AF at risk of stroke receiving guideline-recommended therapy, predominantly driven by increased use of NOACs and reduced use of VKA+\/-AP or AP alone.\nTRIAL REGISTRATION NUMBER: NCT01090362; Pre-results.

Data on the in-hospital management and outcomes of these bleeding events are scarce and information is mostly derived from trial cohorts.\nOBJECTIVES: The objective was to collect data on the management and clinical outcome of hospitalizations owing to VKA-related bleeding in real-world practice.\nPATIENTS AND METHODS: We performed a multicenter observational cohort study involving 21 secondary and tertiary care hospitals in the administrative district Dresden, Saxony, Germany throughout the year 2005. All consenting patients presenting with VKA-related bleeding complications were included. No exclusion criteria applied. Data were collected at admission, at discharge and at 90 days to evaluate resource consumption, length of hospital stay and risk factors for in-hospital- and 3-month mortality.\nRESULTS: Two hundred and ninety patients were included (median age 74 years; 50.7% male). The main indications for VKA therapy were atrial fibrillation (63.4%), prior thromboembolism (18.6%) and mechanical heart valves (11.4%), and most common bleeding localizations were large hematoma (23.1%), upper gastrointestinal (GI) tract (17.9%) and intracranial bleeding (14.1%). On hospital admission, the median International Normalized Ratio (INR) was 3.0 (range 0.9-12.5, interquartile range [IQR] 2.1-3.9). In-hospital mortality was 7.6% with impaired renal function as the most relevant risk factor. At 90 days mortality was 14.1% and 15.3% of survivors were help-dependent.\nCONCLUSIONS: VKA-related bleeding leading to hospitalization is associated with long hospitalization, relevant resource utilization, high mortality or persistent sequlae. Patient-related factors such as impaired renal function, chronic cardiac or pulmonary disease and dementia are predictive of in-hospital and 3-month mortality.

        "Abstract":"BACKGROUND: Anticoagulation therapy with anti-vitamin K (AVK; vitamin K antagonist) for the prevention of thromboembolism in patients with atrial fibrillation (AF) is based on information derived from numerous well constructed, randomized controlled trials. Despite this conclusive evidence of efficacy, several studies have shown that 'real world' use of AVK in patients with AF is suboptimal. Our hypothesis was that geriatric characteristics (functional impairment, cognitive disorders, malnutrition, risk for falls, depression) could be an explanation for the underprescription of AVK in older patients with AF.\nOBJECTIVE: To analyse the barriers to the prescription of AVK therapy, with special attention on geriatric characteristics.\nMETHODS: This was a retrospective study of 768 consecutive geriatric patients admitted to an acute geriatric unit of an academic hospital between April 2006 and November 2008. Data from comprehensive geriatric assessments were collected from computerized medical charts.\nRESULTS: Analysis of data from the 768 medical charts showed that 111 patients (14%) presented with AF. Among the 111 patients (72% women), 45% were living in an institution before admission. These patients presented a high prevalence of geriatric syndromes: cognitive disorders 59%, malnutrition risk 59%, incontinence 35%, depression 37%, and falls 61%. Ninety percent of the patients had an Identification of Seniors At Risk (ISAR) questionnaire score >=2, which indicates an increased risk of frailty and functional decline during hospitalization. The prevalence of conditions measured by the CHADS(2) (congestive heart failure, hypertension, age >75 years, diabetes mellitus and previous stroke or transient ischaemic attack [TIA]) clinical prediction scale was as follows: heart failure 19%, hypertension 79%, age >75 years 95%, diabetes 15% and stroke 24%. The mean +\/- SD number of daily classes of drugs received at admission was 7.1 +\/- 3.3 (median 7, range 0-20). Forty-nine percent of patients had not received any AVK treatment before admission. The level of functional dependence for basic and instrumental activities of daily living did not differ between patients receiving AVK before admission and those not receiving AVK. Similarly, the proportion of geriatric problems (cognitive, malnutrition, depression and falls) did not differ between these two groups. To determine whether the decision to administer AVK therapy before admission was influenced by the risk of an embolic stroke, determined by the presence of CHADS(2) conditions, we compared the proportions of patients who fulfilled those conditions in each group: again, no difference was found.\nCONCLUSIONS: Almost half of the patients presenting with AF did not receive any AVK therapy before admission. In this population, in which most patients had multiple impairments, no single impairment or geriatric characteristic was identified as a barrier to AVK use. It is possible that combinations of impairments and geriatric characteristics were barriers to the prescription of AVK therapy across the whole of this population. More research is needed to identify and clarify the relative importance of patient-, physician- and healthcare system-related barriers to the prescription of AVK therapy in older patients with AF.\n",

Out of 250 clinical charts, 78 were selected of patients over 60 years old, who showed no signs of dementia. Information was obtained regarding demographics, clinical conditions (diagnosis according to ICD-10), complementary investigation, cognitive functions (via CAMCOG), neuroimaging, and the presence of risk factors for VaD. Depression was the most prevalent psychiatric disorder (74%). A great majority of the patients (86%) had at least one risk factor for VaD. One-third of the sample showed three or more risk factors for VaD. The clinical conditions related to risk factors for VaD were hypertension (48.7%), heart disease (30.8%), hypercholesterolemia (25.6%), diabetes mellitus (23.1%), stroke (12.8%), tryglyceride (12.8%), and obesity (5.1%). In terms of lifestyle, smoking (19.2%), alcohol abuse (16.7%), and sedentarism (14.1%) were other risk factors found. Definite risk factors for VaD were found in 83.3% of the patients. Previous interventions targeting risk factors were found in only 20% of the cases. The high rates of risk factors for VaD identified in this sample suggest that psychiatrists should be more attentive to these factors for the prevention of VaD.\n",

This study aims to examine the association between VRFs and the rate of cognitive decline in patients with Alzheimer's disease (AD).\nMETHODS: Data were obtained from patients visiting a memory clinic between 2004 and 2012. VRFs were determined at baseline and included hypertension, hypercholesterolemia, diabetes mellitus, overweight and smoking. Continuous values of blood pressure, total cholesterol, glucose level and body mass index were also obtained. Mini-Mental State Exam (MMSE) scores were obtained at baseline and during follow-up visits. The association between VRFs and the annual change in MMSE scores was analysed with a multivariable linear mixed model adjusted for age, sex and the aforementioned VRFs.\nRESULTS: From 174 patients (mean age 78.3 years), with a follow-up time up to 5.8 years (mean 1.1 year), in total 447 MMSE scores were obtained. The multivariable analyses showed an association between age as well as systolic blood pressure and a decline in annual rates of change in MMSE scores of -0.05 (95% confidence interval (CI): -0.09 to 0.00) and -0.01 (CI: -0.03 to 0.00), respectively. For all other VRFs, including sex, patients did not show a significant difference.\nCONCLUSION: This study did not find an association between preventable vascular risk factors and cognitive decline in patients with AD, except for systolic blood pressure. As the association between systolic blood pressure and decline in MMSE was small, clinical relevance may be limited. Copyright © 2014 Elsevier Ireland Ltd. All rights reserved.\n",

        "Abstract":"It is unclear if atrial fibrillation (AF) is an independent risk factor for cognitive impairment. This review evaluates the available evidence and provides an overview of the association between AF and cognitive function. Electronic database searches, January 1990 to December 2012, identified 271 studies comparing the incidence of cognitive impairment and\/or dementia in patients with\/without AF. Cognitive function was diagnosed by a physician using the mini-mental state examination (MMSE) or other established diagnostic criteria. Studies with <20 participants and without direct comparison to controls in sinus rhythm were excluded. There were no restrictions on the basis of age, language or study design. Full texts of 11 studies were obtained. Eight studies (three cross-sectional, two case-control and three prospective cohorts) reported an association between cognitive decline and AF. Among cross-sectional studies, patients with AF had a 1.7 (95% CI 1.2-2.5) to 3.3 (95% CI 1.6-6.5) greater risk of cognitive impairment, and a 2.3-fold (95% CI 1.4-3.7) increased risk of dementia, compared to patients in sinus rhythm. There was marked heterogeneity in the design, size and quality of studies and reporting of the data which precluded formal meta-analysis. Eight studies reported an association between AF and cognitive impairment and\/or dementia, but the magnitude of risk varied.

        "Abstract":"PURPOSE: To explore the correlation of vascular risk factors for Alzheimer's disease (AD) in Chinese population.\nMETHODS: A total of 123 outpatients with probable AD followed up for 3 years were investigated. Severity of cognitive impairment and functional ability was assessed using Mini-Mental State Examination (MMSE) and modified activities of daily living (ADLs), respectively. The incidence of vascular risk factors was studied in patients with AD.\nRESULTS: Univariate analysis showed significance difference in MMSE and ADL scores between patients with and without vascular risk factors (P < .05). Multiple regression analysis showed age, education, hyperhomocysteinemia, and hypertension were significant variables associated with annual MMSE, while there were no significant correlations between annual MMSE and sex, initial MMSE, diabetes, and so on.\nCONCLUSIONS: Vascular risk factors are common comorbidities in patients with AD in China, with younger, better educated ones showing faster cognitive decline. Hypertension and hyperhomocysteinemia may also aggravate the progression, and it is important to prevent and treat patients with AD. Copyright © The Author(s) 2014.\n",

        "Abstract":"We examined the neuropsychological test performance of a randomly selected community sample of English-speaking non-Hispanic African American and white elders in northern Manhattan. All participants were diagnosed as nondemented by a neurologist, whose assessment was made independent of neuropsychological test scores. African American elders obtained significantly lower scores on measures of verbal and nonverbal learning and memory, abstract reasoning, language, and visuospatial skill than whites. After using a stratified random sampling technique to match groups on years of education, many of the discrepancies became nonsignificant; however, significant ethnic group differences on measures of figure memory, verbal abstraction, category fluency, and visuospatial skill remained. Discrepancies in test performance of education-matched African Americans and whites could not be accounted for by occupational attainment or history of medical conditions such as hypertension and diabetes. These findings emphasize the importance of using culturally appropriate norms when evaluating ethnically diverse elderly for dementia.\n",

        "Abstract":"AIMS: Peroxisome proliferator-activated receptor gamma (PPAR-gamma) agonists exert neuroprotective effects in the brain. Therefore, in this population-based cohort study, we investigated the effects of pioglitazone, a PPAR-gamma agonist, on the risk of dementia.\nMETHODS: By using claims data from Taiwan's National Health Insurance Research Database, we included 6401 patients with diabetes who were treated with pioglitazone and 12,802 age- and sex-matched patients with diabetes who were never treated with pioglitazone from 2004 to 2009 and who were free of dementia at baseline.\nRESULTS: In total, 113 (1.8%) and 323 (2.5%) patients in the pioglitazone-treated and comparison cohorts, respectively, developed dementia during the 5-year follow-up. The risk of dementia decreased by 23% in the pioglitazone-treated cohort compared with that in the comparison cohort after adjustment for age, sex, hypertension, and stroke (adjusted hazard ratio [HR], 0.77; 95% confidence interval [CI]=0.62-0.96). In addition, the adjusted HRs (95% CIs) for dementia were 0.50 (0.34-0.75, P=.001) in high-cumulative dose users, 0.53 (0.36-0.77, P<.001) in long-term users, and 0.66 (0.49-0.90, P=.009) in high-mean daily dose users.\nCONCLUSIONS: Pioglitazone is a time- and dose-dependent protective factor against dementia in patients with diabetes. The risk of dementia is lower in long-term and high-dose pioglitazone users than in never users of pioglitazone. Copyright © 2017 Elsevier Inc. All rights reserved.\n",

Proton pump inhibitors (PPIs) are widely used to reduce gastric acid production, but information on the risk of dementia is lacking. We assessed association between the use of PPIs and the risk of dementia in elderly people. Data were derived from a longitudinal, multicenter cohort study in elderly primary care patients, the German Study on Aging, Cognition and Dementia in Primary Care Patients (AgeCoDe), including 3,327 community-dwelling persons aged >= 75 years. From follow-up 1 to follow-up 4 (follow-up interval 18 months), we identified a total of 431 patients with incident any dementia, including 260 patients with Alzheimer's disease. We used time-dependent Cox regression to estimate hazard ratios of incident any dementia and Alzheimer's disease. Potential confounders included in the analysis comprised age, sex, education, the Apolipoprotein E4 (ApoE4) allele status, polypharmacy, and the comorbidities depression, diabetes, ischemic heart disease, and stroke. Patients receiving PPI medication had a significantly increased risk of any dementia [Hazard ratio (HR) 1.38, 95% confidence interval (CI) 1.04-1.83] and Alzheimer's disease (HR 1.44, 95% CI 1.01-2.06) compared with nonusers. Due to the major burden of dementia on public health and the lack of curative medication, this finding is of high interest to research on dementia and provides indication for dementia prevention.\n",

Weight, anthropometry, biomarkers for breast cancer, diabetes, cardiovascular disease and dementia risk; insulin resistance (HOMA), oxidative stress markers, leptin, adiponectin, insulin-like growth factor (IGF)-1 and IGF binding proteins 1 and 2, androgens, prolactin, inflammatory markers (high sensitivity C-reactive protein and sialic acid), lipids, blood pressure and brain-derived neurotrophic factor were assessed at baseline and after 1, 3 and 6 months.\nRESULTS: Last observation carried forward analysis showed that IER and CER are equally effective for weight loss: mean (95% confidence interval ) weight change for IER was -6.4 (-7.9 to -4.8) kg vs -5.6 (-6.9 to -4.4) kg for CER (P-value for difference between groups = 0.4). Both groups experienced comparable reductions in leptin, free androgen index, high-sensitivity C-reactive protein, total and LDL cholesterol, triglycerides, blood pressure and increases in sex hormone binding globulin, IGF binding proteins 1 and 2. Reductions in fasting insulin and insulin resistance were modest in both groups, but greater with IER than with CER; difference between groups for fasting insulin was -1.2 (-1.4 to -1.0) muU ml(-1) and for insulin resistance was -1.2 (-1.5 to -1.0) muU mmol(-1) l(-1) (both P = 0.04).\nCONCLUSION: IER is as effective as CER with regard to weight loss, insulin sensitivity and other health biomarkers, and may be offered as an alternative equivalent to CER for weight loss and reducing disease risk.\n",

        "Abstract":"INTRODUCTION: Population aging translates into more people with chronic non-communicable diseases, disability, frailty and dependency. The study of frailty--a clinical syndrome associated with an increased risk of falls, disability, hospitalization, institutionalization and death--is important to improve clinical practice and population health indicators.\nOBJECTIVES: In a cohort of older adults in Havana and Matanzas provinces, Cuba, estimate prevalence of frailty and its risk factors; determine incidence of dependency; estimate mortality risk and identify mortality predictors.\nMETHODS: A prospective longitudinal study was conducted door to door, from June 2003 through July 2011, in a cohort of 2813 adults aged >=65 years living in selected municipalities of Havana and Matanzas provinces; mean followup time was 4.1 years. Independent variables included demographics, behavioral risk factors and socioeconomic indicators, chronic non-communicable diseases (hypertension, stroke, dementia, depression, diabetes, anemia), number of comorbidities, and APOE epsilon4 genotype. Dependent variables were frailty, dependency and mortality. Criteria for frailty were slow walking speed, exhaustion, weight loss, low physical activity and cognitive decline. Prevalence and frailty risk were estimated by Poisson regression, while dependency and mortality risks and their predictors were determined using Cox regression.\nRESULTS: Frailty syndrome prevalence was 21.6% (CI 17.9%-23.8%) at baseline; it was positively associated with advanced age, anemia and presence of comorbidities (stroke, dementia, depression, three or more physically debilitating diseases). Male sex, higher educational level, married or partnered status, and more household amenities were inversely associated with frailty prevalence. In followup, dependency incidence was 33.1 per 1000 person-years (CI 29.1-37.6) and mortality was 55.1 per 1000 person-years. Advanced age, male sex, lower occupational status during productive years, dependency, frailty, dementia, depression, cerebrovascular disease and diabetes were all associated with higher risk of death.\nCONCLUSIONS: Given the challenge for developing countries presented by demographic and epidemiologic transition; the high prevalence in older adults of frailty syndrome, dependency and chronic non-communicable diseases; and the association of all these with higher mortality, attention should be targeted to older adults as a risk group. This should include greater social protection, age-appropriate health services, and modification and control of cardiovascular risk factors.\n",

The study sample comprised 1,480 randomly invited subjects aged 60 to 93 years, and had a participation rate of 82% at follow-up. OH test included assessment of blood pressure and symptoms of OH.\nRESULTS: The 6-year incidence of MCI was 8%, increasing from 12.1 to 40.5 per 1,000 person-years for men and 6.9 to 16.9 per 1,000 person-years for women aged 60 to >80 years. The corresponding 6-year incidence of dementia was 8%. Orthostatic intolerance during uprising was related to risk for MCI at follow-up (odds ratio [OR] =1.84 [1.20-2.80][95% CI]), adjusted for age and education independently of blood pressure during testing. After stratification for hypertension (HT), the corresponding age-adjusted OR for MCI in the non-HT group was 1.71 (1.10-2.31) and 1.76 (1.11-2.13) in the HT group. Among controls, the proportion of those with OH was 16%; those with MCI 24%; and those with dementia 31% (age-adjusted OR 1.93 [1.19-3.14]).\nCONCLUSION: Not only OH, but also symptoms of OH, seem to be a risk factor for cognitive decline and should be considered in the management of blood pressure among the elderly population.\n",

To date, the demographic and acute medical care use patterns of patients in these practices have not been described.\nDESIGN: A descriptive study using a 6-month retrospective record review of adults enrolled in a medical primary care practice that provides on-site primary medical care in SLCs.\nSETTING: Greater Rochester, New York.\nPARTICIPANTS: Participants were 681 patients residing in 19 SLCs.\nMEASUREMENTS: Demographic and clinical data were collected. Use of acute medical care by patients in the SLC program, including phone consultation, provider emergent\/urgent in-home visit, emergency department (ED) visit, and hospital admissions, were recorded. ED visit and hospital admissions at the 2 primary referral hospitals for the practice were reviewed for chief complaint and discharge plan.\nRESULTS: A total of 635 (93%) of 681 records were available. The median age was 85 years (interquartile range [IQR] 77, 89). Patients were predominantly female (447, 70%) and white (465, 73%). Selected chronic medical diseases included dementia\/cognitive impairment (367, 58%), cardiac disease (271, 43%), depression (246, 39%), diabetes (173, 27%), pulmonary disease (146, 23%), renal disease (118, 19%), cancer (115, 18%), and stroke\/TIA (93,15%). The median Mini Mental State Examination score was 25 (IQR 19, 28; n = 446). Patients took a median of 10 medications (IQR 7, 12). Important medication classes included cardiovascular (512, 81%), hypoglycemics (117, 18%), benzodiazepines (71, 11%), dementia (194, 31%), and anticoagulants (51, 8%). Patients received acute care 1876 times (median frequency 3, IQR 2, 6) for 1504 unique medical issues. Falls were the most common complaint (399, 20%). Of these 1876 episodes, patients accessed acute care via telephone (1071, 57%), provider visit at the SLC (417, 22%), and ED visit (388, 21%). Of the cases conducted via telephone, 693 (67%) were resolved by phone, 253 (24%) required home visits, 15 (1%) required subspecialist follow-up, and 81 (8%) required ED evaluation. Of the cases prompting a home visit by a medical provider, 399 (96%) were resolved during the visit, 13 (3%) required subspecialist follow-up, and 4 (1%) required ED evaluation. Of the 389 cases conducted via ED visit, 164 (42%) were admitted to the hospital and 2 (0.5%) died.\nCONCLUSION: SLC primary care medical practices serve a population that is older, has significant medical comorbidity, and frequently accesses acute medical care. Although many acute care issues for this population are handled via phone, home visits and\/or ED use is common. Understanding the acute care health utilization patterns of SLC dwellers is critical to designing systems to optimally address the acute care needs of aging older adults.

Inconclusive results have been reported in clinical trials of rosiglitazone, an insulin sensitizer that also increases cardiovascular mortality risks. No study has yet reported a protective cognitive effect of metformin, an insulin-sensitizing biguanide widely used in diabetic patients. We studied 365 older persons aged 55 and over in the population-based Singapore Longitudinal Aging Study with diabetes who were followed up over 4 years. The odds ratios (OR) of association of metformin use (n = 204) versus non-use (n = 161) with cognitive impairment (Mini-Mental State Exam <= 23), and by duration: up to 6 years (n = 114) and more than 6 years (n = 90) were evaluated in cross-sectional and longitudinal multivariate analyses. Controlling for age, education, diabetes duration, fasting blood glucose, vascular and non-vascular risk factors, metformin use showed a significant inverse association with cognitive impairment in longitudinal analysis (OR = 0.49, 95% CI 0.25-0.95). Metformin use showed significant linear trends of association across duration of use in cross-sectional and longitudinal analyses (p = 0.018 and p = 0.002, respectively), with use for more than 6 years significantly associated with lowest risk of cognitive impairment in both cross-sectional analysis (OR = 0.30, 95% CI 0.11-0.80) and in longitudinal analysis (OR = 0.27, 95% CI 0.12-0.60). No significant interactive effects of metformin use with APOE-epsilon4, depression, or fasting glucose level were observed. Among individuals with diabetes, long-term treatment with metformin may reduce the risk of cognitive decline. Further studies should establish the role of hyperglycemia and insulin resistance, and the protective role of metformin in the risk of cognitive decline and dementia.\n",

Eighty-two patients (42 women and 40 men; mean age, 65.5 y) were included.\nINTERVENTIONS: Not applicable.\nMAIN OUTCOME MEASURES: We measured postvoid residual (PVRs) by catheterization or by using an ultrasonic bladder scanner. Twenty-five patients (30.5%) had IBE with PVRs greater than 100 mL on 2 consecutive days. Patients with IBE were evaluated by a urologist and subsequently underwent urodynamic studies.\nRESULTS: The presence of IBE was significantly associated with urinary tract infection (P<.001) and aphasia (P=.046). The presence of IBE was not related to sex, stroke location, nature of stroke (hemorrhagic or ischemic), history of diabetes mellitus, or previous stroke. Urodynamic studies done on 22 patients with IBE revealed acontractile detrusor in 8 patients (36%) and detrusor underactivity in 3 (14%). Eleven patients (50%) had detrusor-external sphincter dyssynergia (DESD) combined with normative detrusor function (5 patients) or detrusor hyperactivity (6 patients); all but 1 of these patients had a supratentorial lesion. The presence of DESD was associated with a longer onset-to-evaluation interval (P=.018) [corrected] and spasticity of the stroke-affected lower limb (P=.02). [corrected] Diabetes mellitus was associated with the presence of acontractile detrusor or detrusor underactivity (P=.03).\nCONCLUSIONS: IBE is common among patients with stroke and is caused by decreased detrusor contractility or DESD. Spasticity of the external urethral sphincter is a possible pathophysiologic mechanism of DESD. Copyright 2010 American Congress of Rehabilitation Medicine. Published by Elsevier Inc.

We followed up this cohort 9-12 years later to assess cognitive function with the Mini-Mental State Examination (MMSE), to update exposure status, and to obtain genomic material. Multivariate analysis was used to identify independent baseline predictors of cognitive outcome 9-12 years later.\nRESULTS: We followed up 387 subjects (58.6% of survivors). After adjusting for baseline cognition, poorer cognitive outcome was found to be independently associated with a family history of dementia, increasing age, less decline in systolic blood-pressure, lower premorbid IQ (rather than limited education), and abstinence from alcohol.\nCONCLUSIONS: Reduction in systolic blood pressure (among hypertensives) and moderate alcohol intake could protect against cognitive deterioration in late life.\n",

Compared with patients with eGFRs>=60mL\/min\/1.73m(2), fully adjusted IRRs for pneumonia among those with eGFRs<15, 15 to 29, 30 to 44, and 45 to 59mL\/min\/1.73m(2) were 3.04 (95% CI, 2.42-3.83), 1.73 (95% CI, 1.57-1.92), 1.19 (95% CI, 1.11-1.28), and 0.95 (95% CI, 0.89-1.01), respectively. Associations between lower eGFRs and sepsis were stronger, with fully adjusted IRRs up to 5.56 (95% CI, 3.90-7.94). Those associations with LRTI were weaker but still clinically relevant at up to 1.47 (95% CI, 1.34-1.62). In fully adjusted models, a history of proteinuria remained an independent marker of increased infection risk for LRTI, pneumonia, and sepsis (IRRs of 1.07 [95% CI, 1.05-1.09], 1.26 [95% CI, 1.19-1.33], and 1.33 [95% CI, 1.20-1.47]).\nLIMITATIONS: Patients without creatinine results were excluded.\nCONCLUSIONS: Strategies to prevent infection among people with CKD are needed.

        "Abstract":"Recent studies have revealed that type 2 diabetes mellitus (T2DM) is a risk factor for cognitive dysfunction or dementia, especially those related to Alzheimer's disease (AD). Basic research suggests that insulin accelerates Alzheimer-related pathology through its effects on the amyloid beta (Abeta). Several pathological studies with autopsy samples have demonstrated, however, that dementia subjects with diabetes have less AD-related neuropathology than subjects without diabetes. We and others have reported that small vessel diseases affect cognitive function in older diabetics. Asymptomatic ischemic lesions in T2DM subjects may lower the threshold for the development of dementia and this may explain the inconsistency between the basic research and clinicopathological studies. Longitudinal follow-up of T2DM subjects without overt dementia using both amyloid imaging and magnetic resonance imaging may elucidate these issues. Following up until the development of overt dementia would make it possible to compare both amyloid load and ischemic lesions before and after the development of dementia. Moreover, amyloid imaging in non-demented older people with or without insulin resistance would verify the role of insulin in the processing and deposition of Abeta. Vascular risk factors may represent a therapeutic target, while neurodegenerative pathologies have not yet been amenable to treatment. It remains to be investigated whether medical interventions on vascular risk factors have protective effects against the development and progress of dementia.\n",

        "Abstract":"AIMS: To determine whether atrial fibrillation (AF) in stroke-free patients is associated with impaired cognition and structural abnormalities of the brain. AF contributes to stroke and secondary cognitive decline. In the absence of manifest stroke, AF can activate coagulation and cause cerebral microembolism which could damage the brain.\nMETHODS AND RESULTS: We cross-sectionally evaluated 122 stroke-free individuals with AF recruited locally within the German Competence Network on AF. As comparator, we recruited 563 individuals aged 37-84 years without AF from the same community. Subjects underwent 3 T magnetic resonance imaging to assess covert territorial brain infarction, white matter lesions, and brain volume measures. Subjects with evidence for stroke, dementia, or depression were excluded. Cognitive function was assessed by an extensive neuropsychological test battery covering the domains learning and memory, attention and executive functions, working memory, and visuospatial skills. Cognitive scores and radiographic measures were compared across individuals with and without AF by stepwise multiple regression models. Stroke-free individuals with AF performed significantly worse in tasks of learning and memory (s = -0.115, P < 0.01) as well as attention and executive functions (s = -0.105, P < 0.01) compared with subjects without AF. There was also a trend (P = 0.062) towards worse performance in learning and memory tasks in patients with chronic as compared with paroxysmal AF. Corresponding to the memory impairment, hippocampal volume was reduced in patients with AF. Other radiographic measures did not differ between groups.\nCONCLUSION: Even in the absence of manifest stroke, AF is a risk factor for cognitive impairment and hippocampal atrophy. Therefore, cognition and measures of structural brain integrity should be considered in the evaluation of novel treatments for AF.\n",

        "Abstract":"Alzheimer's disease (AD) and diabetes mellitus (DM) are two of the most common and devastating health problems in the elderly. They share a number of common features amongst which high prevalence after 65 years, important impact of patient's quality of life, substantial health care costs. Reviews on the epidemiological studies on cognitive impairment in patients with DM found evidence of cross-sectional and prospective associations between type 2 DM and moderate cognitive impairment, on memory and executive functions. There is also evidence for an elevated risk of both vascular dementia and AD in patients with type 2 DM, albeit with strong interaction of other factors such as hypertension, dyslipidaemia and ApoE genotype. DM is an independent predictor of post-stroke dementia. DM being an atherogenic risk factor, it may increase the risk of dementia through associations with stroke, causing vascular dementia. In addition, vascular reactivity may be adversely affected by advanced glycosylation end products resulting in more subtle perfusion abnormalities. Cerebrovascular disease may exacerbate AD through direct interactions between the two pathological processes or through cognitive impairment secondary to cerebrovascular disease \"unmasking\" AD at an earlier stage than it would otherwise become apparent. The increased risk of AD may also be mediated by the exacerbation of B-amyloid neurotoxicity by advanced glycosylation end products identified in the matrix of neurofibrillary tangles and amyloid plaques in AD brains, or associations with insulin functions. Decreased cholinergic transport across the blood-brain barrier observed in diabetic animals may exacerbate cognitive impairment in AD. Many interventions could reduce the cognitive decline associated with DM, yet not enough are taken into account so far. [References: 151]\n",

        "Abstract":"BACKGROUND: Antipsychotic medications have been increasingly and more widely prescribed despite continued uncertainty about their association with the incidence of acute myocardial infarction (AMI).\nMETHODS AND RESULTS: We investigated the risk of AMI associated with antipsychotic treatment in 56 910 patients with schizophrenia, mood disorders, or dementia first hospitalized or visiting an emergency room for AMI in 1999 to 2009. A case-crossover design was used to compare the distributions of antipsychotic exposure for the same patient across 1 to 30 and 91 to 120 days just before the AMI event. Adjustments were made for comedications and outpatient visits. The adjusted odds ratio of AMI risk was 2.52 (95% confidence interval, 2.37-2.68) for any antipsychotics, 2.32 (95% confidence interval, 2.17-2.47) for first-generation antipsychotics, and 2.74 (95% confidence interval, 2.49-3.02) for second-generation antipsychotics. The risk significantly increased (P<0.001) with elevations in dosage and in short-term use (<=30 days). Male patients, elderly patients, and patients with dementia were at significantly increased risk (all P<0.001). Physically healthier patients with no preexisting diabetes mellitus, hypertension, or dyslipidemia were at significantly greater risk (P<0.001), largely because they had been exposed to higher doses of antipsychotics (P<0.001). A study of the selected binding of antipsychotics to 14 neurotransmitter receptors revealed only dopamine type 3 receptor antagonism to be significantly associated with AMI risk (adjusted odds ratio, 2.59; 95% confidence interval, 2.43-2.75; P<0.0001).\nCONCLUSIONS: Antipsychotic use may be associated with a transient increase in risk for AMI, possibly mediated by dopamine type 3 receptor blockades.

        "Abstract":"To fulfill criteria for probable Alzheimer's disease (AD), patients must be free of cerebrovascular lesions that may explain the cognitive decline. These criteria probably lead to an underestimation of the links between risk factors for stroke and AD. However, the association between stroke and AD is probably more frequent than expected. Arterial hypertension is the most important risk factor for stroke. The aim of this study is to evaluate, from the literature, the possible relationship between blood pressure and AD. Cognitive performances are usually lower in patients with arterial hypertension. A longitudinal study revealed that patients with AD aged 79-85 are more likely to have had higher values of blood pressure 10 to 15 years earlier, and they usually have a spontaneous decline of blood pressure beginning 1 or 2 years before the onset of AD. The relationship between arterial hypertension and AD is probably due to the summation of Alzheimer pathology, white matter changes and cerebrovascular lesions. A possible consequence of these findings would be to prevent, or to postpone, AD by an early treatment of arterial hypertension. This is currently evaluated in drug trials. [References: 114]\n",

Further examination was conducted in the Pittsburgh, Pa, cohort (n = 927), where participants with MCI were classified as having either the MCI amnestic-type or the MCI multiple cognitive deficits-type.\nSETTING: Multicenter population study.\nPATIENTS: This study includes all participants of the Cardiovascular Health Study Cognition Study (n = 3608) who had a magnetic resonance imaging (MRI) scan of the brain between 1991 and 1994, and detailed neuropsychological, neurological, and medical evaluations to identify the presence of MCI or dementia in the period 1998 to 1999. The mean time between the closest clinical examination to the MRI and the diagnostic evaluation for cognitive disorders was 5.8 years for the Cardiovascular Health Study Cognition Study cohort and 6.0 years for the Pittsburgh cohort.\nMAIN OUTCOME MEASURES: Risk factors for MCI at the time of the MRI were identified using logistic regression, controlling for age, race, educational level, baseline Modified Mini-Mental State Examination and Digit Symbol Test scores, measurements of depression, MRI findings (atrophy, ventricular volume, white matter lesions, and infarcts), the presence of the apolipoprotein E (APOE) epsilon4 allele, hypertension, diabetes mellitus, and heart disease.\nRESULTS: Mild cognitive impairment (n = 577) was associated with race (African American), low educational level, low Modified Mini-Mental State Examination and Digit Symbol Test scores, cortical atrophy, MRI-identified infarcts, and measurements of depression. The MCI amnestic-type was associated with MRI-identified infarcts, the presence of the APOE epsilon4 allele, and low Modified Mini-Mental State Examination scores. The MCI multiple cognitive deficits-type was associated with low Modified Mini-Mental State Examination and Digit Symbol Test scores.\nCONCLUSIONS: The development of MCI is associated with measurements of cognition and depression, racial and constitutional factors, and cerebrovascular disease. Early cognitive deficits seem to be a common denominator for the 2 forms of MCI; the presence of cerebrovascular disease and the APOE epsilon4 allele is associated with the amnestic type of MCI.\n",

The relationship among diabetes mellitus, insulin, and AD is an important area of investigation. However, whether cognitive impairment seen in those with diabetes is mediated by excess pathological features of AD or other related abnormalities, such as vascular disease, remains unclear.\nOBJECTIVE: To investigate the association between serial measures of glucose intolerance and insulin resistance and in vivo brain beta-amyloid burden, measured with carbon 11-labeled Pittsburgh Compound B (11C-PiB), and AD pathology at autopsy.\nDESIGN: Scores calculated from the Consortium to Establish a Registry for Alzheimer's Disease (CERAD) and Braak criteria were correlated with measures of hyperglycemia, hyperinsulinemia, glucose intolerance, and insulin resistance in 197 participants who underwent autopsy after death and who had undergone 2 or more oral glucose tolerance tests (OGTT) using grouped analyses and a continuous mixed-models analysis. The same measures of glucose intolerance and insulin resistance were also correlated with brain 11C-PiB retention in an additional 53 living subjects from the Baltimore Longitudinal Study of Aging neuroimaging study.\nSETTING: Prospective, serially assessed cohort of community-dwelling subjects.\nPARTICIPANTS: Cohort 1 consisted of 197 participants enrolled in the Baltimore Longitudinal Study of Aging who had 2 or more OGTTs during life and a complete brain autopsy after death.

Thirty subjects with frank diabetes mellitus who received medications also had AD pathology scores that were similar to those of the cohort as a whole.\nCONCLUSIONS AND RELEVANCE: In this prospective cohort with multiple assessments of glucose intolerance and insulin resistance, measures of glucose and insulin homeostasis are not associated with AD pathology and likely play little role in AD pathogenesis. Long-term therapeutic trials are important to elucidate this issue.\n",

High hemoglobin A1c (HbA1c) has also been associated with dementia, and is the primary contributor to T2D complications. Here we investigated whether the association of duration of T2D with cognitive functioning is modulated by HbA1C levels.\nMETHODS: This study examined nondemented community-dwelling T2D elderly (N = 897) participating in the Israel Diabetes and Cognitive Decline study, who were assessed with a broad neuropsychological battery. Subjects were all from the Maccabi Healthcare Services, which has a Diabetes Registry with complete HbA1c measurements since 1998. Partial correlations were performed to examine the modulating effect of HbA1c on the relationship of duration of T2D with five cognitive measures, controlling for sociodemographic and cardiovascular risk factors.\nRESULTS: An interaction of duration of T2D with HbA1c was associated with executive functioning (p = 0.006), semantic categorization (p = 0.019), attention\/working memory (p = 0.011), and overall cognition (p = 0.006), such that the associations between duration of T2D and cognitive impairment increased as HbA1c levels increased-but not for episodic memory (p = 0.984).\nCONCLUSIONS: Because duration of T2D was associated with cognition in higher HbA1c levels and overall no associations were found in lower HbA1c levels, our results suggest that individuals with T2D may limit their risk of future cognitive decline by maintaining long-term good glycemic control.

        "Abstract":"Vascular factors play a role in the etiology of Alzheimer's disease (AD), presumably due to emergence of white matter lesions. However, important white matter structures involved in the etiology of AD, including the corpus callosum (CC), remain invariably free from macroscopical white matter lesions, although loss of microstructural integrity assessed with diffusion tensor imaging (DTI) has been described in the CC. Vascular factors have been related to these microstructural white matter changes too, but little is known about their effect on the CC. In 499 subjects with cerebral small vessel disease, aged 50-85 years, we cross-sectionally investigated the relation between hypertension, hypertension treatment status, the microstructural integrity of the CC using DTI, and the attendant cognitive performance. Fractional anisotropy and mean diffusivity were calculated in four substructures of the CC (genu, anterior body, posterior body, and splenium). Differences between groups were calculated with analysis of variance, adjusted for age, gender, and cardiovascular risk factors. Compared with normotensive subjects, hypertensive subjects had a lower fractional anisotropy in the splenium and a significant higher mean diffusivity in both the anterior body and the splenium; this was most noticeable in treated uncontrolled hypertensive subjects. Furthermore we found that microstructural integrity of the CC was related to global cognition. Of this relation, 14 to 60% was explained by the mediating effect of small vessel disease elsewhere in the white matter. Our findings indicate that adequate blood pressure treatment might postpone these changes and the attendant cognitive dysfunction.\n",

        "Abstract":"BACKGROUND: Despite declining age-adjusted stroke mortality rates, the disease remains the third most common cause of death in Israel. Based on a national survey, we examined mortality rates during the first 3 years after a first-ever acute ischemic stroke (IS) and the major predictors of short-term (1 month) and long-term (3 years) mortality.\nMETHODS: In the National Acute Stroke Israeli Survey (NASIS 2004), data were collected on all hospitalized stroke patients in Israel during a 2-month period. Mortality rates for first-ever IS were assessed at 1 month and 3 years and predictors of death were evaluated using the Cox proportional hazard model.\nRESULTS: A total of 1,079 first-ever IS patients were included. Survival data were complete for over 99% of patients. Cumulative mortality rates were 9.9% at 1 month and 31.1% at 3 years. Of the survivors at 1 month, 23.5% did not survive for 3 years. At 1 month, the hazard ratio (HR) for death significantly increased with stroke severity. One-month mortality was also associated with a decreased level of consciousness (HR 2.9, 95% CI 1.7-5.1), total anterior circulation infarction (TACI); HR 4.9, 95% CI 1.6-15.2), temperature on admission (HR 1.5, 95% CI 1.1-2.1 per 1 degrees C), age (HR 1.04, 95% CI 1.02-1.07 per year) and glucose levels on admission (HR 1.003, 95% CI 1.001-1.006 per 1 mg\/dl). Age-adjusted proportions of diabetes and chronic heart failure were considerably higher in the deceased compared with survivors at 3 years (48 vs. 38 and 21 vs. 9%, respectively). In the multivariate survival analyses, predictors of death at 1 month also predicted death at 3 years; however, history of dementia (HR 1.5, 95% CI 1.0-2.4), diabetes (HR 1.6, 95% CI 1.0-2.4), peripheral artery disease (HR 1.7, 95% CI 1.1-2.8), chronic heart failure (HR 1.6, 95% CI 1.1-2.4) and malignancy (HR 1.7, 95% CI 1.1-2.7) were additional predictors of long-term mortality for patients surviving the first month after stroke.\nCONCLUSIONS: Approximately one third of patients did not survive 3 years after the first-ever IS. While age and markers of severe stroke were the major predictors of death at 1 month, comorbidities and variables associated with atherosclerotic vascular disease predicted long-term mortality. Improved control of these factors can potentially reduce long-term mortality in stroke victims. Copyright 2009 S. Karger AG, Basel.\n",

In this follow-up study, we investigated the effects of SSLI on the SN and movement disorders in patients with Parkinson's disease (PD).\nMETHODS: A total of 60 untreated patients with early-stage PD, divided into control and SSLI groups, were enrolled in this study. All participants underwent conventional MRI and DKI twice; at baseline and after a 1-year period. We analyzed the differences of the following variables between the two groups: mean kurtosis (MK) values of the SN, the severity of disease, daily dosage of levodopa, and the variation of these indexes from baseline to 1-year visit. Logistic regression analysis was used to identify the major risk factors for SSLI in PD patients.\nRESULTS: 1. All variables showed significant differences between the two groups. 2. The variation in MK values of the SN had a positive correlation with the variation in the severity of disease. 3. Hypertension and hyperhomocysteinemia were independent factors for SSLI in patients with PD.\nCONCLUSION: As PD progresses, movement disorders become more prominent, with increased structural changes to the SN, especially in patients with SSLI. Furthermore, PD patients with hypertension and hyperhomocysteinemia are more likely to have SSLI. Copyright © 2017. Published by Elsevier Ltd.\n",

The mean follow-up time was 3.4 years. Using linear regressions with Generalized Estimating Equation, selected medical conditions (diabetes mellitus, hypertension, coronary heart disease, cerebrovascular disease (CVD), osteoporosis, arthritis, and cancer), low cognitive function, depression, and smoking were associated with worse functional outcomes. Exercise and moderate alcohol use were associated with better functional outcomes. Over the follow-up period, coronary heart disease, CVD, and depression were associated with increased rates of functional decline. Exercise and moderate alcohol consumption were associated with decreased rates of functional decline. Significant interactions were observed between exercise and coronary heart disease, moderate alcohol use and CVD, and cognition and CVD.\nCONCLUSIONS: Our study has identified not only risk factors associated with functional decline but also the interactions among these factors. These observations, along with other published research, add to the growing understanding of the underlying process of functional change and could provide a basis to design effective strategies to delay functional decline.\n",

        "Abstract":"PURPOSE: To examine the demographic, clinical, and pharmacological correlates of regular laxative use in elderly persons residing in a long-term care setting.\nMETHODS: This was a cross-sectional study using retrospective record review undertaken in an academically affiliated long-term care facility in the United States. All individuals residing in the institution for at least 1 month (n = 694) were characterized regarding use of laxatives. Regular laxative use was defined as more than 30 doses of laxatives, stool softeners, or enemas taken over the most recent 1-month period.\nRESULTS: Residents with regular laxative use (n = 349) were compared with those who received no laxatives (n = 227). Factors significantly associated with regular laxative use at the P < 0.05 significance level were simultaneously included in a multiple logistic regression model. Factors associated with regular laxative use were immobility, Parkinson's disease, diabetes mellitus, and use of iron supplements, calcium channel blockers, and antidepressants with moderate to strong anticholinergic properties.\nCONCLUSION: Regular laxative use is often associated with neurologic dysfunction that directly or indirectly affects the gut, or medications known to depress colonic motility. Identification of potentially modifiable correlates of regular laxative use in older individuals may suggest management strategies to avoid or reduce laxative, stool softener, and enema requirements, improve constipation symptoms, and enhance quality of life for the frail elderly population.\n",

        "Abstract":"In older individuals, inflammatory mechanisms have been linked to the pathogenesis of both dementia and functional impairment. In this cross-sectional study we have investigated the possible association between some markers of systemic inflammation and functional status, in a sample of one hundred and forty older demented patients including 60 patients with late onset Alzheimer's disease (LOAD) and 80 with vascular dementia (VD). Functional status was evaluated by Barthel Index (BI); the total score ranged from 0 (total dependency) to 20 (total autonomy). Interleukin-1beta, Tumor Necrosis Factor-alpha, Interleukin- 6, Interleukin- 8, and Transforming Grow Factor beta were quantified by ELISA. Among the cytokines evaluated, only IL-6 was correlated with the BI (r: -0.32, p < 0.001). The mean levels of IL-6 progressively decreased from I (9.50 pg\/mL), to II (6.40 pg\/mL), to III BI tertile (4.80 pg\/mL) (p < 0.02). At multiple regression analysis, IL-6 was associated with BI in the whole sample and in VD, but not in LOAD, independent of age, gender, smoking, alcohol consumption, hypertension, diabetes, coronary heart disease, previous stroke, and mini mental state examination score. Our study suggests the existence of an independent and negative relationship between IL-6 plasma levels and functional status in older individuals with vascular dementia. This finding might contribute to explain the 'excess of disability' phenomenon described in older demented patients.\n",

        "Abstract":"OBJECTIVE: To examine whether antihypertensive medication use can affect the occurrence and progression of dementia.\nSUBJECTS AND METHODS: In a community cohort of 1810 persons aged 75 years and older, 225 prevalent cases of dementia were detected. Among the 1301 persons without dementia, 224 incident cases of dementia were identified during an average period of 3 years. Among the 225 prevalent cases of dementia, 79 were suitable for the analysis of cognitive decline. Information on drug use was collected for the 2 weeks preceding the baseline interview.\nRESULTS: Subjects taking antihypertensive medication (n = 651, 83.9% of whom took diuretics) had a lower prevalence of dementia than those not taking antihypertensive medication (P<.001). Subjects without dementia who were taking antihypertensive medication at baseline (n = 584) had a reduced incidence of dementia (adjusted relative risk, 0.7; 95% confidence interval, 0.6-1.0; P = .03). Furthermore, subjects taking diuretics (n = 484) had an adjusted relative risk of 0.7 (95% confidence interval, 0.5-1.0; P = .02) for all dementia, and subjects taking diuretic monotherapy (n = 345) had an adjusted relative risk of 0.6 (95% confidence interval, 0.4-0.9; P = .006). The use of other antihypertensive medication (calcium antagonists or beta-blockers), however, was related to a reduced risk of Alzheimer disease (adjusted relative risk, 0.6; 95% confidence interval, 0.3-1.2) only in the subpopulation with a higher baseline blood pressure (n = 458). Patients with dementia at baseline who were not taking diuretics had a 2-fold faster rate of decline in the score on the Mini-Mental State Examination than those taking diuretics.\nCONCLUSION: The use of diuretics may protect against dementia in elderly persons.\n",

        "Abstract":"Epidemiological studies have identified a robust association between type II diabetes mellitus and Alzheimer disease (AD), and neurobiological studies have suggested the presence of central nervous system insulin resistance in individuals with AD. Given this association, we hypothesized that the central nervous system-penetrant insulin-sensitizing medication metformin would be beneficial as a disease-modifying and\/or symptomatic therapy for AD, and conducted a placebo-controlled crossover study of its effects on cerebrospinal fluid (CSF), neuroimaging, and cognitive biomarkers. Twenty nondiabetic subjects with mild cognitive impairment or mild dementia due to AD were randomized to receive metformin then placebo for 8 weeks each or vice versa. CSF and neuroimaging (Arterial Spin Label MRI) data were collected for biomarker analyses, and cognitive testing was performed. Metformin was found to be safe, well-tolerated, and measureable in CSF at an average steady-state concentration of 95.6 ng\/mL. Metformin was associated with improved executive functioning, and trends suggested improvement in learning\/memory and attention. No significant changes in cerebral blood flow were observed, though post hoc completer analyses suggested an increase in orbitofrontal cerebral blood flow with metformin exposure. Further study of these findings is warranted.\n",

        "Abstract":"Vascular dementia (VaD) is a heterogeneous pathology currently regarded as the result of a variety of causes. Different types of VaD can be identified according to different criteria. This heterogeneity might be one of the causes of the controversial results observed, up to now, in clinical trials. Recently, the 10th revision of the International Classification of Diseases (ICD-10) explicitly identified subcortical VaD as a well-defined subgroup. Abnormalities of white matter are clearly detectable with computed tomography or magnetic resonance scans. The clinicoradiological association of dementia, blood hypertension, and other vascular risk factors, extensive white matter lesions, and small subcortical infarcts might be considered as a clinical univocal entity. Following the encouraging results of a preliminary pilot study, the above-mentioned criteria were followed to define a population of patients to be enrolled in a double-blind, parallel-groups, placebo-controlled clinical trial with nimodipine, which has been proposed as a drug that can improve cognitive functions in patients with VaD. The paper discusses the protocol design of this ongoing trial and its main entry criteria, with particular emphasis on the definition of the population to be enrolled. Implication for future trials in subcortical VaD are discussed further.\n",

Those with falls and\/or early dementia may be at particular risk for stroke and hemorrhage.\nOBJECTIVE: The aim of this study was to determine the prescribing patterns, risks, and benefits of anticoagulation with warfarin or acetylsalicylic acid (ASA) in elderly patients with AF at risk for stroke and hemorrhage, including those with falls and\/or dementia.\nMETHODS: In this single-center, retrospective, observational study, data from patients aged > or =65 years with chronic nonvalvular AF treated at an urban academic geriatrics practice over a 1-year period were included. Eligible patients were receiving noninvasive management of AF with warfarin or ASA. Data were assessed to determine the prevalences of stroke, hemorrhage, falls, and the possible effects of anticoagulation with dementia. Outcomes events at 12 months, including time-in-therapeutic range (TTR), stroke, hemorrhage, and death, were determined. The stroke risk in each patient was estimated using the CHADS(2) (congestive heart failure, hypertension, age > or =75 years, diabetes, history of stroke or transient ischemic attack) score, and the risk for hemorrhage was estimated using the Outpatient Bleeding Risk Index.\nRESULTS: A total of 112 patients (mean age, 82 years) were identified; 106 were included in the present analysis (80 women, 26 men); 6 were not receiving antithrombotic therapy and thus were excluded from the analysis. Warfarin was prescribed in 85% (90 patients); ASA, 15% (16). International normalized ratio testing was done frequently, with a median interval of 13.7 days between tests (92% within 28 days). No association was found between an improved TTR and the number of tests per unit of time or the number of patients per clinician. The distributions of both the CHADS(2) and Outpatient Bleeding Risk Index scores were not significantly different between the warfarin and ASA groups. The proportions of patients treated with warfarin were not significantly different between the groups with a high risk for hemorrhage and the groups at lower risk. At 12 months in the 90 patients initially treated with warfarin, the rate of stroke was 2% (2 patients); major hemorrhage, 6% (5); and death, 20% (18). Mortality was greater in patients with falls (45% [5\/11]) and\/or dementia (47% [8\/17]) compared with those without either falls or dementia (12% [8\/65]).\nCONCLUSIONS: In this well-monitored geriatric population with chronic AF, including patients with falls and\/or dementia, a high percentage were prescribed warfarin (85%), with low rates of stroke, hemorrhage, and death at 12 months despite a low TTR. Patients with falls and\/or dementia had a high mortality rate (approximately 45%).\n",

Less attention has been paid to the effect of obesity on dementia. This overview discusses methodological issues related to the epidemiologic study of obesity and dementia, reviews results of long-term prospective studies, and briefly considers possible mechanisms for an obesity-dementia association. At least six cohort studies of 18 to 32 years duration confirm that overweight middle-aged or older adults are at increased risk of dementia in later life. In many of these studies, the association persisted after adjusting for classical cardiovascular risk factors. A few epidemiologic studies (and more laboratory studies not reviewed here) suggest biomarkers such as C-reactive protein, interleukin 6, and leptin may explain part of the obesity-dementia connection. If any of these factors are in the causal pathway to dementia, their reversal or prevention by weight control would have huge public health importance. [References: 34]\n",

        "Abstract":"High blood pressure is a major risk factor for stroke and is also closely correlated with cognitive decline and dementia. Indeed, most longitudinal studies showed that cognitive functioning is often inversely proportional to blood pressure values measured 15 or 20 years previously. Because of the aging of the population, the frequency of stroke and dementia will dramatically increase in the coming years. Therefore, the prevention of cerebrovascular and cognitive disorders represents a major challenge. Antihypertensive drugs have shown clinical benefits in both primary and secondary prevention of strokes. Consensus is generally that blood-pressure lowering represents the major determinant of the benefit conferred by the antihypertensive treatment for stroke prevention; however, recent studies have suggested some differences between classes of antihypertensive drugs. The results of therapeutic trials (Systolic Hypertension in Europe, Perindopril Protection Against Recurrent Stroke Study [PROGRESS]) open the way to the prevention of dementia (vascular or Alzheimer's type) by antihypertensive treatments. These two studies suggest different mechanisms for the prevention of cognitive decline using antihypertensive drugs. In this context, reduced incidence of dementia should be the primary outcome of future trials comparing different classes of antihypertensive drugs. [References: 40]\n",

The identification of factors of EOAD might provide insights into Alzheimer's disease (AD) pathogenesis.\nMETHODS: Data from over 3000 subjects with AD from C-Path Online Data Repository were used to compare demographics, comorbidities and prescribed medications between EOAD and late-onset Alzheimer's disease (LOAD). The generalized estimating equations binomial model was used to identify factors associated with EOAD, allowing for within-trials correlation (multiple patients from one single trial).\nRESULTS: Despite the similar proportions in White, Asian and Black between EOAD and LOAD, a significantly higher proportion of EOAD population was from other races: Native American Indian, Alaskan and Hawaiian and other minorities (including Hispanics) (P < 0.0001); and were more likely to have anxiety or depression (P < 0.0001). A high proportion of the LOAD population reported a history of AD from any relative (70% vs. 58%); atrial fibrillation, hypertension, heart disease, stroke, hypercholesterolaemia and hypothyroidism were over-represented in LOAD (P < 0.01). LOAD patients used more risperidone and donepezil (P < 0.01). The multivariable model results showed that, compared with LOAD, EOAD patients were more frequently from other races and were more likely to have anxiety or depression, with less hypertension, stroke and atrial fibrillation.\nCONCLUSION: Early-onset Alzheimer's disease is found more frequently in Native American Indians, Alaskans, Hawaiians and other minorities, including Hispanics; patients with EOAD have more anxiety or depression.

A subset of 329 individuals had fluorodeoxyglucose (FDG) PET. We ascertained presently existing cardiovascular and metabolic conditions (CMC) from health care records and used the summation of presence\/absence of hypertension, hyperlipidemia, cardiac arrhythmias, coronary artery disease, congestive heart failure, diabetes mellitus, and stroke as a surrogate for vascular health. We used global amyloid from Pittsburgh compound B PET, entorhinal cortex tau uptake (ERC-tau) from tau-PET, and neurodegeneration in AD signature regions from MRI and FDG-PET as surrogates for AD pathophysiology. We dichotomized participants into CMC = 0 (CMC- ) versus CMC > 0 (CMC+ ) and tested for age-adjusted group differences in AD biomarkers. Using structural equation models (SEMs), we assessed the impact of vascular health on AD biomarker cascade (amyloid leads to tau leads to neurodegeneration) after considering the direct and indirect age, sex, and apolipoprotein E effects.\nRESULTS: CMC+ participants had significantly greater neurodegeneration than CMC- participants but did not differ by amyloid or ERC-tau. The SEMs showed that (1) vascular health had a significant direct and indirect impact on neurodegeneration but not on amyloid; and (2) vascular health, specifically the presence of hyperlipidemia, had a significant direct impact on ERC-tau.\nINTERPRETATION: Vascular health had quantifiably greater impact on neurodegeneration in AD regions than on amyloid deposition.

We aim to evaluate antihypertensive drugs for an association with PD in hypertensive patients.\nMETHODS: Hypertensive patients who were free of PD, dementia and stroke were recruited from 2005-2006 using Taiwan National Health Insurance Database. We examined the association between the use of calcium channel blockers (CCBs), angiotensin converting enzyme inhibitors (ACEIs), angiotensin receptor blockers (ARBs) and the incidence of PD using beta-blockers as the reference. Cox regression model with time-varying medication use was applied.\nRESULTS: Among 65,001 hypertensive patients with a mean follow-up period of 4.6 years, use of dihydropyridine CCBs, but not non-dihydropyridine CCBs, was associated with a reduced risk of PD (adjusted hazard ratio [aHR] = 0.71; 95% CI, 0.57-0.90). Additionally, use of central-acting CCBs, rather than peripheral-acting ones, was associated with a decreased risk of PD (aHR = .69 [55-0.87]. Further decreased association was observed for higher cumulative doses of felodipine (aHR = 0.54 [0.36-0.80]) and amlodipine (aHR = 0.60 [0.45-0.79]). There was no association between the use of ACEIs (aHR = 0.80 [0.64-1.00]) or ARBs (aHR = 0.86 [0.69-1.08]) with PD. A potentially decreased association was only found for higher cumulative use of ACEIs (HR = 0.52 [0.34-0.80]) and ARBs (HR = 0.52 [0.33-0.80]).\nCONCLUSIONS: Our study suggests centrally-acting dihydropyridine CCB use and high cumulative doses of ACEIs and ARBs may associate with a decreased incidence of PD in hypertensive patients. Further long-term follow-up studies are needed to confirm the potential beneficial effects of antihypertensive agents in PD.\n",

        "Abstract":"Olive oil (OO) is the most representative food of the traditional Mediterranean Diet (MedDiet). Increasing evidence suggests that monounsaturated fatty acids (MUFA) as a nutrient, OO as a food, and the MedDiet as a food pattern are associated with a decreased risk of cardiovascular disease, obesity, metabolic syndrome, type 2 diabetes and hypertension. A MedDiet rich in OO and OO per se has been shown to improve cardiovascular risk factors, such as lipid profiles, blood pressure, postprandial hyperlipidemia, endothelial dysfunction, oxidative stress, and antithrombotic profiles. Some of these beneficial effects can be attributed to the OO minor components. Therefore, the definition of the MedDiet should include OO. Phenolic compounds in OO have shown antioxidant and anti-inflammatory properties, prevent lipoperoxidation, induce favorable changes of lipid profile, improve endothelial function, and disclose antithrombotic properties. Observational studies from Mediterranean cohorts have suggested that dietary MUFA may be protective against age-related cognitive decline and Alzheimer's disease. Recent studies consistently support the concept that the OO-rich MedDiet is compatible with healthier aging and increased longevity. In countries where the population adheres to the MedDiet, such as Spain, Greece and Italy, and OO is the principal source of fat, rates of cancer incidence are lower than in northern European countries. Experimental and human cellular studies have provided new evidence on the potential protective effect of OO on cancer. Furthermore, results of case-control and cohort studies suggest that MUFA intake including OO is associated with a reduction in cancer risk (mainly breast, colorectal and prostate cancers).

        "Abstract":"OBJECTIVE: The prevalence of dementia continues to rise, and yet, there are few known modifiable risk factors. Depression, as a treatable condition, may be important in the development of dementia. Our objective was to examine the association between depressive symptoms and longitudinal cognitive changes in older adults who were high-functioning at baseline.\nMETHODS: The authors analyzed data from a community-based cohort (aged 70-79 at baseline), who, at study entry, scored 7 or more (out of 9) on the Short Portable Mental Status Questionnaire (SPMSQ). Depressive symptoms were assessed at baseline using the depression subscale of the Hopkins Symptom Check List. Cognitive performance was measured at baseline and at seven-year follow up by the SPMSQ and by summary scores from standard tests of naming, construction, spatial recognition, abstraction, and delayed recall.\nRESULTS: After adjusting for potential confounders, including age, education, and chronic health conditions such as diabetes, heart attack, stroke, and hypertension, a higher number of baseline depressive symptoms were strongly associated with greater seven-year decline in cognitive performance and with higher odds of incident cognitive impairment, i.e., decline in SPMSQ score to < or = 6 (adjusted odds ratio per quartile of depressive symptoms score: 1.34, 95% confidence interval: 1.10-1.68).\nCONCLUSIONS: Depressive symptomatology independently predicts cognitive decline and incident cognitive impairment in previously high-functioning older persons.\n",

        "Abstract":"AIM: To evaluate the cognitive performance of a homogeneous population of Alzheimer's disease (AD), non-demented Type 2 Diabetes Mellitus (DIAB), demented with concomitant diseases (AD+DIAB) and healthy control subjects. AD is a progressive dementia disorder characterized clinically by impairment of memory, cognition and behavior. Recently, a major research interest in AD has been placed on early evaluation. Diabetes is one of the clinical conditions that represent the greatest risk of developing oxidative stress and dementia. Glucose overload, leading to the development of impaired-induced insulin secretion in DIAB and has been suggested to slow or deter AD pathogenesis.\nMETHODS: The degree of cognitive impairment was determined on the Alzheimer Disease Assessment Scale-Cognitive (ADAS-Cog) and the Folstein's Mini Mental State Examination (MMSE); the severity of dementia was quantified applying the Clinical Dementia Rating (CDR) test; the Hamilton test was employed to evaluate depressive conditions; the final population studied was 101 subjects.\nRESULTS: The cognitive deterioration is statistically significantly lower (p<0.05) in AD+DIAB patients as compared with AD patients.\nCONCLUSIONS: In this longitudinal study the superimposed diabetic condition was associated with a lower rate of cognitive decline, while diabetic non-demented patients and controls present normal scores.

        "Abstract":"OBJECTIVE: We aimed to investigate the differences in clinical characteristics and pharmacological treatment associated with the presence of diabetes in a large cohort of patients with dementia.\nRESEARCH DESIGN AND METHODS: A cross-sectional registry-based study was conducted using data from the Swedish Dementia Registry (SveDem). Data on dementia diagnosis, dementia type, and demographic determinants were extracted from SveDem. Data from the Swedish Patient Register and Prescribed Drug Register were combined for the diagnosis of diabetes. Data on antidiabetic, dementia, cardiovascular, and psychotropic medications were extracted from the Swedish Prescribed Drug Register. Logistic regression was used to determine whether the variables were associated with diabetes after adjustment for confounders. In total, 29,630 patients were included in the study, and 4,881 (16.5%) of them received a diagnosis of diabetes.\nRESULTS: In the fully adjusted model, diabetes was associated with lower age at dementia diagnosis (odds ratio [OR] 0.97 [99% CI 0.97-0.98]), male sex (1.41 [1.27-1.55]), vascular dementia (1.17 [1.01-1.36]), and mixed dementia (1.21 [1.06-1.39]). Dementia with Lewy bodies (0.64 [0.44-0.94]), Parkinson disease dementia (0.46 [0.28-0.75]), and treatment with antidepressants (0.85 [0.77-0.95]) were less common among patients with diabetes. Patients with diabetes who had Alzheimer disease obtained significantly less treatment with cholinesterase inhibitors (0.78 [0.63-0.95]) and memantine (0.68 [0.54-0.85]).\nCONCLUSIONS: Patients with diabetes were younger at dementia diagnosis and obtained less dementia medication for Alzheimer disease, suggesting less optimal dementia treatment. Future research should evaluate survival and differences in metabolic profile in patients with diabetes and different dementia disorders. Copyright © 2017 by the American Diabetes Association.\n",

        "Abstract":"INTRODUCTION: Previous studies of omega-3 fatty acids report improved outcomes where inflammation is a key factor. The objective of this systematic review is to evaluate effects of omega-3s on inflammatory biomarkers.\nMETHODS: Randomized clinical studies that measured the influence of omega-3 fatty acids on inflammatory biomarkers were identified using a comprehensive search. Eligible studies were rated with the American Dietetic Association Evidence Analysis Manual and Grading of Recommendations, Assessment, Development and Evaluation (GRADE) process to examine study quality and risk\/benefit.\nRESULTS: 112 studies were included. Over 65% reported statistically significant effects. The majority were scored as low risk of bias (high quality) and scored strong (cardiac populations and critically ill) to weak (Alzheimer's Disease, hypertriglyceridemia\/diabetes, and obesity) on the risk\/benefit ratio evidence for modulation of inflammatory biomarkers. There was inadequate data to determine a GRADE for inflammatory biomarker studies for some conditions (healthy individuals, rheumatoid arthritis, metabolic syndrome, renal disease, pregnancy, or children).\nCONCLUSION: Clinical literature on the effects of omega-3 fatty acids on inflammatory biomarkers contains mostly small sample sizes, is neutral to high quality, and report mixed effects. Larger studies examining dose and delivery are needed. Reprint & Copyright © 2014 Association of Military Surgeons of the U.S.\n",
