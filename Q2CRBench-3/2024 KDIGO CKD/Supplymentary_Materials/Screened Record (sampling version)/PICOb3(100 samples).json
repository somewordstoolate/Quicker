        "Abstract":"OBJECTIVE: To describe the characteristics and management of patients with gout in France during the year 2014.\nMETHODS: Data were obtained from a computerized observational longitudinal patient database of a representative sample of 1200 general practitioners. Patients on urate-lowering treatment and\/or colchicine were described by demographics and comorbidities, quality of management indicators (serum uric acid and renal function testing) and treatment (type of urate-lowering treatment, change and dose regimen).\nRESULTS: We identified 14,400 patients (84.4% men, mean age: 67.5 years) with gout in the database. The most frequent comorbidities were hypertension (70%), dyslipidemia (51%), diabetes (24%) and obesity (23%). The proportion with uric acid and renal function testing data was 32% and 29%, respectively. In gout patients, only 39% had a serum uric acid<6mg\/dL. Among treated gout patients, 76% were receiving allopurinol at a mean dose lower than 200mg\/d, most without any further change of dose regimen over one year.\nCONCLUSION: These data outlined the persistence of clinical inertia in 2014 for patients with gout.",

        "Abstract":"50\nXanthine oxidase (XO) is a critical target for the therapy of hyperuricemia and gout. In this study, a number of 3-[4-alkoxy-3-(1H-tetrazol-1-yl) phenyl]-1,2,4-oxadiazol-5(4H)-ones (3a-3w) were newly designed by a bioisosteric replacement and hybrid strategy with the hope of obtaining novel and effective nonpurine XO inhibitors. Subsequently, these compounds were synthesized through a three-step procedure, with good yields. In addition, the in vitro bovine XO inhibitions were measured by spectrophotometric determination of uric acid formation at 295 nm using allopurinol as a positive control. As a result, compound 3j was found to be the most potent XO inhibitor, with an IC value of 0.121 µM, which was approximately 63-fold more potent than allopurinol, and the analysis of the structure-activity relationships indicated that the hydrophobic group at 4'-position was essential for inhibitory potency. Additionally, the molecular modeling results showed that the 1,2,4-oxadiazol-5(4H)-one moiety binds to XO active site via various hydrogen bonds with Arg880 and Thr1010. Moreover, the compound 3j was demonstrated to be a mixed-type nonpurine XO inhibitor. Furthermore, the hypouricemic studies on a rat model, induced by potassium oxonate, demonstrated that serum uric acid levels could be effectually reduced by compound 3j at an oral dose of 15 mg\/kg. Therefore, compound 3j could be a promising lead compound for the treatment of hyperuricemia and gout.",

        "Abstract":"['Background:', 'Case report:', 'Conclusion:']\nLesch-Nyhan disease (LND) is a rare X-linked recessive inborn error of purine metabolism. Late diagnosis of LND may cause significant morbidity. LND cases have never been reported in Indonesia. A 15-year-old male who had been diagnosed with cerebral palsy was referred to our hospital due to renal failure requiring emergency dialysis. The patient presented with three classic manifestations of LND: increased uric acid levels, neurological disorders, and self-injurious behaviors. LND was suspected because of an abscess-like lump on the left ankle that was confirmed to be a tophus, which had burst and discharged thick masses containing blood, debris, and white crystal materials. The diagnosis of LND was confirmed by the presence of a deletion to exon 1 of the HPRT1 gene. The patient received oral allopurinol daily and treatment for end-stage renal disease (ESRD), which included regular dialysis and subcutaneous administration of erythropoietin. At a 2-month follow-up, he improved clinically with a 71% decrease in uric acid levels after regular dialysis and allopurinol treatment. In developed countries, LND can be diagnosed as early as 3 days after birth. However, diagnosis in the present case was delayed due to the rarity of the disease and the limited number of facilities in Indonesia that offer genetic counseling. Late diagnosis of LND leads to ESRD and irreversible abnormalities. This is the first case of LND presenting with a unique clinical presentation of tophus burst reported in Indonesia.",

DECT scans of feet and radiographs of hands and feet were obtained at baseline, year 1, and year 2 visits. DECT scans were scored for bone erosion and urate volume.\nRESULTS: Paired imaging data were available for 87 patients (42 in the dose-escalation group and 45 in the control group). At year 2, the progression in the CT erosion score was higher in the control group than in the dose-escalation group (+7.8% versus +1.4%; P = 0.015). Changes in plain radiography erosion or narrowing scores did not differ between groups. Reductions in DECT urate volume were observed in both groups. At year 2, patients in the control group who had an SU level of <0.36 mmoles\/liter and patients in the dose-escalation group had reduced DECT urate volume (-27.6 to -28.3%), whereas reduction in DECT urate volume was not observed in control group patients with an SU level of ≥0.36 mmoles\/liter (+1.5%) (P = 0.023).\nCONCLUSION: These findings provide evidence that long-term urate-lowering therapy using a treat-to-SU-target strategy can influence structural damage and reduce urate crystal deposition in gout.",

        "Abstract":"BACKGROUND: Tumor lysis syndrome (TLS) is a metabolic emergency in hematology patients. The recommended dose of rasburicase for the management of TLS is 0.2 mg\/kg per day for 5 days, which is cost prohibitive for many patients. We sought to determine the efficacy of single low-dose rasburicase in the prevention and treatment of hyperuricemia in TLS.\nPATIENTS AND METHODS: We planned a prospective study for the safety and efficacy of fixed (weight based) dose of rasburicase to manage TLS. Patients diagnosed with leukemia\/lymphoma with laboratory or clinically confirmed TLS or presence of ≥ 2 high-risk factors and serum uric acid > 7.5 mg\/dL were included. The primary endpoint was uric acid normalization (< 7.5 mg\/dL) within 24 hours of rasburicase administration.\nRESULTS: Fifty-five patients were recruited for this study. Pediatric patients (< 18 years) accounted for 43.6% of cases. Rasburicase was provided prophylactically to 43 patients (78.2%) and for treating TLS to 12 (21.8%). Mean ± standard deviation serum uric acid at baseline and 24 hours was 9.2 ± 1.8 mg\/dL and 3.2 ± 2.1 mg\/dL, respectively. There was significant reduction in the serum uric acid and creatinine (P < .001) within 24 hours of rasburicase administration. The response was maintained up to 72 hours. A single dose of rasburicase was effective in 94.5% of patients. Single low-dose rasburicase led to 95% direct cost savings compared to the recommended dose.\nCONCLUSION: Single-dose rasburicase with frequent laboratory monitoring is effective in the management of TLS and offers significant cost reductions.",

        "Abstract":"Hyperuricemia may promote the progression of hypertension and renal dysfunction. However, the effects of hyperuricemia treatment on blood pressure and renal function in adult hypertensive patients with hyperuricemia remain unclear. A total of 137 hypertensive patients with hyperuricemia (96 men and 41 women; mean age of 67 years) who recently started taking xanthine oxidase inhibitors (allopurinol or febuxostat) as outpatients were recruited. Serum uric acid level, estimated glomerular filtration rate (eGFR, ml min(-1) per 1.73 m(2)) and blood pressure (mm Hg) were retrospectively compared immediately before and shortly after starting treatment with xanthine oxidase inhibitors. The mean blood pressure and the eGFR immediately before starting treatment were 128\/71 mm Hg and 44.6 ml min(-1) per 1.73 m(2), respectively. Although the eGFR decreased from 46.6 to 44.6 ml min(-1) per 1.73 m(2) before starting treatment with xanthine oxidase inhibitors, it increased to 46.2 ml min(-1) per 1.73 m(2) (P=0.001, compared with immediately before treatment) without any significant changes in blood pressure after the administration of xanthine oxidase inhibitors. Multiple regression analysis revealed that the increase in eGFR after starting xanthine oxidase inhibitor treatment positively correlated with the changes in systolic blood pressure and negatively correlated with the changes in uric acid levels and the use of renin-angiotensin system inhibitors. These results suggest that xanthine oxidase inhibitors may delay the progression of renal dysfunction in adult hypertensive patients with hyperuricemia.",

A fixed-effects model was used to evaluate the standardized mean differences (SMDs) with 95% confidence intervals (CIs). We conducted subgroup analysis, sensitivity analysis, and analyzed publication bias, to comprehensively estimate the renoprotective effects of febuxostat in hyperuricemic patients with CKD.\nRESULTS: Among 296 retrieved studies, 5 relevant RCTs were included in the meta-analysis. The result showed that serum estimated glomerular filtration rate (eGFR) was improved after febuxostat treatment in hyperuricemic patients with CKD, with an SMD (95% CI) of 0.24 [-0.17 to 0.43] and P = .67 (fixed-effects model). No heterogeneity was observed across studies (I  = 0% and P = .67). Subgroup analysis suggested that treatment-related reductions in serum eGFR levels were not related to drug doses, intervention times, or region.\nCONCLUSIONS: The present meta-analysis suggests that febuxostat may slow the progression of mild-to-moderate CKD.

        "Abstract":"This review article summarizes the relevant English literature on gout from 2010 through April 2017. It emphasizes that the current epidemiology of gout indicates a rising prevalence worldwide, not only in Western countries but also in Southeast Asia, in close relationship with the obesity and metabolic syndrome epidemics. New pathogenic mechanisms of chronic hyperuricaemia focus on the gut (microbiota, ABCG2 expression) after the kidney. Cardiovascular and renal comorbidities are the key points to consider in terms of management. New imaging tools are available, including US with key features and dual-energy CT rendering it able to reveal deposits of urate crystals. These deposits are now included in new diagnostic and classification criteria. Overall, half of the patients with gout are readily treated with allopurinol, the recommended xanthine oxidase inhibitor (XOI), with prophylaxis for flares with low-dose daily colchicine. The main management issues are related to patient adherence, because gout patients have the lowest rate of medication possession ratio at 1 year, but they also include clinical inertia by physicians, meaning XOI dosage is not titrated according to regular serum uric acid level measurements for targeting serum uric acid levels for uncomplicated (6.0 mg\/dl) and complicated gout, or the British Society for Rheumatology recommended target (5.0 mg\/dl). Difficult-to-treat gout encompasses polyarticular flares, and mostly patients with comorbidities, renal or heart failure, leading to contraindications or side effects of standard-of-care drugs (colchicine, NSAIDs, oral steroids) for flares; and tophaceous and\/or destructive arthropathies, leading to switching between XOIs (febuxostat) or to combining XOI and uricosurics.",

Thus, we attempted to conduct a randomized controlled study using the Chinese population with advanced grade of CKD.\nMETHODS: One hundred CKD patients in stages 3 and 4 with asymptomatic hyperuricemia from seven medical centers were included in this prospective randomized controlled study and assigned to the control and febuxostat group, the latter of which received febuxostat to titrate to achieve serum uric acid (SUA) < 6 mg\/dL. The observation period was 12 months. The primary outcomes included the event of estimated glomerular filtration rate (eGFR) decline ≥ 30% or 50% from baseline at 12 months, dialysis and death from CKD; secondary outcome was the change in eGFR. Safety analysis was also performed.\nRESULTS: Forty-seven patients and 45 patients in the febuxostat and control groups, respectively completed the study. Seven of 47 (14.9%) participants reached 30% decline in eGFR in the febuxostat group, while 1 (2.1%) and 2 (4.3%) patients reached 50% decline in eGFR or dialysis. Thirteen (28.9%), 10 (22.2%) and 3 (6.7%) of 45 patients reached primary kidney outcomes separately in the control group.

In this work, we have demonstrated the preparation of a drug-drug cocrystal of a hypertension drug (Telmisartan; TEL) with a hyperuricemia drug (Febuxostat; FEB) in 1:1 molar ratio using a solvent evaporation method for the first time. Generally, a multi-component system may yield either a eutectic, salt, and\/or a cocrystal. This study adopted a methodical orthogonal framework to analyze the final solid form. A single crystal X-ray structural investigation revealed the formation of a heterosynthon with carboxylic and benzimidazole groups of FEB and TEL, respectively, in the triclinic P-1 space group. ΔpKa of the heterosynthon is ∼1.5, hence, based on the empirical rules, a salt-cocrystal continuum is hypothesized. Further, attenuated total reflectance Fourier transform infrared (ATR-FTIR), and Raman spectroscopy were employed to corroborate the hydrogen bond formation in the heterosynthon (-N---H-O-), which confirmed the propensity for cocrystal formation. An accelerated stability study and an in vitro biorelevant dissolution study of the cocrystal were performed, which demonstrated that it is physiochemically stable, but it resulted in a slower dissolution rate when compared with plain drugs.",

Whether fenofibrate produces sustained reductions in uric acid and gout attacks is unknown.\nMETHODS: In the Fenofibrate Intervention and Event Lowering in Diabetes (FIELD) trial, participants aged 50-75 years with type 2 diabetes were randomly assigned to receive either co-micronised fenofibrate 200 mg once per day or matching placebo for a median of 5 years follow-up. We did a post-hoc analysis of recorded on-study gout attacks and plasma uric acid concentrations according to treatment allocation. The outcomes of this analysis were change in uric acid concentrations and risk of on-study gout attacks. The FIELD study is registered with ISRCTN, number ISRCTN64783481.\nFINDINGS: Between Feb 23, 1998, and Nov 3, 2000, 9795 patients were randomly assigned to fenofibrate (n=4895) or placebo (n=4900) in the FIELD study. Uric acid concentrations fell by 20·2% (95% CI 19·9-20·5) during the 6-week active fenofibrate run-in period immediately pre-randomisation (a reduction of 0·06 mmol\/L or 1 mg\/dL) and remained -20·1% (18·5-21·7, p<0·0001) lower in patients taking fenofibrate than in those on placebo in a random subset re-measured at 1 year. With placebo allocation, there were 151 (3%) first gout events over 5 years, compared with 81 (2%) among those allocated fenofibrate (HR with treatment 0·54, 95% CI 0·41-0·70; p<0·0001). In the placebo group, the cumulative proportion of patients with first gout events was 7·7% in patients with baseline uric acid concentration higher than 0·36 mmol\/L and 13·9% in those with baseline uric acid concentration higher than 0·42 mmol\/L, compared with 3·4% and 5·7%, respectively, in the fenofibrate group. Risk reductions were similar among men and women and those with dyslipidaemia, on diuretics, and with elevated uric acid concentrations. For participants with elevated baseline uric acid concentrations despite taking allopurinol at study entry, there was no heterogeneity of the treatment effect of fenofibrate on gout risk. Taking account of all gout events, fenofibrate treatment halved the risk (HR 0·48, 95% CI 0·37-0·60; p<0·0001) compared with placebo.\nINTERPRETATION: Fenofibrate lowered uric acid concentrations by 20%, and almost halved first on-study gout events over 5 years of treatment.

        "Abstract":"BACKGROUND: The factors associated with a low plasma xanthine oxidoreductase (XOR) activity were not elucidated in patients with acute heart failure (AHF).\nMETHODS: Two-hundred and twenty-nine AHF patients who visited the emergency department were prospectively analyzed. AHF patients were divided into 3 groups according to the plasma XOR quartiles (Q1 = low-XOR group [n = 57], Q2\/Q3 = middle-XOR group [n = 115], and Q4 = high-XOR group [n = 57]). The prognostic nutritional index (PNI) and the controlling nutritional status (CONUT) score were evaluated.\nRESULTS: The multivariate logistic regression model showed that the nutritional status (PNI: OR 1.044, 95% CI 1.000-1.088; CONUT: OR 3.805, 95% CI 1.158-12.498), age, and serum creatinine level were independently associated with a low plasma XOR activity. The Kaplan-Meier curve showed a significantly lower incidence of heart failure events in the low-XOR group than in the middle + high-XOR group (hazard ratio, HR 1.648, 95% CI 1.061-2.559). In particular, a low XOR activity with an increased serum creatinine level (>1.21 mg\/dL) was independently associated with heart failure events (HR 1.937, 95% CI 1.199-3.130).\nCONCLUSION: A low plasma XOR activity was associated with malnutrition, renal dysfunction, and aging in AHF. A low XOR activity complicated with renal dysfunction leads to adverse long-term outcomes.",

        "Abstract":"Over the last decade, there have been major advances in the understanding of the genetic basis of hyperuricaemia and gout as well as of the pharmacogenetics of urate-lowering therapy. Key findings include the reporting of 28 urate-associated loci, the discovery that ABCG2 plays a central role on extra-renal uric acid excretion, the identification of genes associated with development of gout in the context of hyperuricaemia, recognition that ABCG2 variants influence allopurinol response, and the impact of HLA-B*5801 testing in reducing the prevalence of allopurinol hypersensitivity in high-risk populations. These advances, together with the reducing cost of whole genome sequencing, mean that integrated personalised medicine approaches may soon be possible in clinical practice. Genetic data may inform assessment of disease prognosis in individuals with hyperuricaemia or established gout, personalised lifestyle advice, selection and dosing of urate-lowering therapy, and prevention of serious medication adverse effects. In this article, we summarise the discoveries from genome-wide association studies and discuss the potential for translation of these findings into clinical practice.",

However, definitive evidence is lacking.\nSTUDY DESIGN: Randomized, double-blind, placebo-controlled trial.\nSETTING & PARTICIPANTS: 467 patients with stage 3 CKD and asymptomatic hyperuricemia at 55 medical institutions in Japan.\nINTERVENTION: Participants were randomly assigned in a 1:1 ratio to receive febuxostat or placebo for 108 weeks.\nOUTCOMES: The primary end point was the slope (in mL\/min\/1.73m per year) of estimated glomerular filtration rate (eGFR). Secondary end points included changes in eGFRs and serum uric acid levels at 24, 48, 72, and 108 weeks of follow-up and the event of doubling of serum creatinine level or initiation of dialysis therapy.\nRESULTS: Of 443 patients who were randomly assigned, 219 and 222 assigned to febuxostat and placebo, respectively, were included in the analysis.

Risk factors include male sex; obesity; hypertension; alcohol intake; diuretic use; a diet rich in meat and seafood; chronic kidney disease; a diet heavy in fructose-rich food and beverages; being a member of certain ethnic groups, including Taiwanese, Pacific Islander, and New Zealand Maori; and living in high-income countries. Gout is characterized by swelling, pain, or tenderness in a peripheral joint or bursa, including the development of a tophus. Diagnosis of gout can be made using several validated clinical prediction rules. Arthrocentesis should be performed when suspicion for an underlying septic joint is present; synovial fluid or tophus analysis should be performed if the diagnosis is uncertain. Colchicine, nonsteroidal anti-inflammatory drugs, and corticosteroids relieve pain in adults with acute gout episodes. Indications for long-term urate-lowering therapy include chronic kidney disease, two or more flare-ups per year, urolithiasis, the presence of tophus, chronic gouty arthritis, and joint damage. Allopurinol and febuxostat are used to prevent flare-ups, although febuxostat is associated with an increase in all-cause and cardiovascular mortality and is therefore not routinely recommended.",

        "Published":"2018-12-04",
        "Abstract":"INTRODUCTION: Pegloticase is a PEGylated uric acid specific enzyme indicated for the treatment of refractory gout. Anti-pegloticase antibodies contribute to high discontinuation rates, increased risk of infusion reactions, and early loss of drug efficacy.\nOBJECTIVE: To describe the use of methotrexate to recapture function of pegloticase after development of anti-drug antibodies while treating gout.\nMETHODS: We report two cases of using methotrexate as an adjunct to treatment with pegloticase for refractory tophaceous gout. We also present the results of a literature review on the use of concomitant immunosuppressive therapy with pegloticase to prevent anti-pegloticase antibody development.\nRESULTS: Patient A, a 55-year-old man with a history of tophaceous gout, was treated with pegloticase but developed high serum urate(sUA) levels prior to his third infusion. Adjunctive treatment with methotrexate restored pegloticase response and the patient's sUA levels decreased, and remained low for the remainder of his treatment. Patient B, a 36-year-old man with a history of tophaceous gout, was treated with pegloticase. Oral methotrexate was initiated at the first infusion. Low sUA levels were achieved but increased after a lapse in methotrexate compliance. Re-initiation of methotrexate restored pegloticase response and the patient tolerated subsequent infusions. Literature review identified three reports of successful use of concomitant pegloticase and immunosuppressive therapy for refractory tophaceous gout, including an open label trial with a subset of 7 transplant recipients, an additional case study of pegloticase treatment with one transplant recipient, and a case study of pegloticase administered with low-dose azathioprine.\nCONCLUSION: Prophylactic use of immunosuppressive therapy with pegloticase may enable sustained treatment and improve outcomes. Additionally, immunosuppressive therapy seems to show the ability to recapture pegloticase response after development of anti-drug antibodies. The use of immunosuppressants to prevent anti-drug antibody formation, recapture pegloticase efficacy, and reduce discontinuation rates warrants further study.",

Open-label pharmacokinetic studies were performed in volunteers or subjects with hyperuricemia (serum uric acid ≥ 8 mg\/dL) to investigate interactions of lesinurad (with and without concurrent XOIs) with colchicine and 2 nonsteroidal anti-inflammatory drugs: naproxen and indomethacin. Colchicine studies included consecutive 7-day treatment periods of (1) allopurinol 300 mg, allopurinol 300 mg plus lesinurad 400 or 600 mg, and continued lesinurad 400 or 600 mg; or (2) febuxostat 40 or 80 mg, febuxostat 40 or 80 mg plus lesinurad 400 mg, and continued febuxostat 40 or 80 mg plus lesinurad 600 mg. Naproxen and indomethacin studies included lesinurad 400 mg on day 1, naproxen 250 mg twice daily or indomethacin 25 mg twice daily on days 2-6, and lesinurad 400 mg plus continued naproxen or indomethacin on days 7-13 and the morning of day 14. Lesinurad did not alter the pharmacokinetics of naproxen and modestly altered exposure to colchicine (AUC decrease of ≤ 25%) and indomethacin (AUC increase of ∼35%).

        "Abstract":"Epidemiological studies indicate that hyperuricaemia is an independent risk factor for cardiovascular disease. Alongside uric acid formation, increased xanthine oxidase activity also results in the formation of oxidative free radicals and superoxide particles. Oxidative stress significantly contributes to the development of cardiovascular disease, including endothelial cell dysfunction, atherosclerosis, vascular calcification and impaired myocardial energetics. Allopurinol, a competitive xanthine oxidase inhibitor, in addition to reducing serum uric acid levels, can act as a free radical scavenger. Although traditionally used for the management of gout, there has been renewed interest in the role of allopurinol in the management of cardiovascular disease. In this review, we summarise the role of the xanthine oxidase pathway in the generation of oxidative stress and evaluate the current body of evidence assessing the clinical effects of allopurinol in patients with cardiovascular disease. A number of small clinical studies have shown a beneficial effect of allopurinol in reducing ischemia-reperfusion injury in the setting of bypass surgery and coronary angioplasty. Additionally, studies in heart failure indicate a potential favourable effect of allopurinol on endothelial dysfunction, LV function and haemodynamic indices, particularly in those with raised serum uric acid levels. Whilst this cheap and readily available pharmacological option may offer a very cost effective therapeutic option, large-scale prospective studies are required to better delineate its role in reducing hard clinical end-points.",

        "Abstract":"BACKGROUND: Gout is a common chronic disease with a high recurrence rate. To date, the debate continues about the best time for using urate lowering therapy (ULT) during an acute gout attack.\nOBJECTIVE: This updated meta-analysis is designed to assess the clinical efficacy of ULT in the management of acute exacerbations of gout. Through the results, we hope to determine whether uric acid lowering agents should be used to manage acute exacerbations of gout.\nMETHODS: A comprehensive search of six databases without language restrictions includes PubMed, Cochrane Library, Web of Science, EMBASE, CNKI, and WanFang data. The literature used was published before October 2019. Six randomized controlled trials (RCTs) with 557 patients met the inclusion criteria. Standardized mean difference (SMD), weighted mean difference (WMD), risk ratio (RR), and 95% confidence interval (CI) were used for estimating the clinical efficacy of ULT in acute gout.\nRESULTS: Data results showed no statistical difference in the pain visual analogue score (VAS) by day 3 (weighted mean difference (WMD), 0.06; 95% CI, - 0.13 to 0.25; I 0%; P = 0.55), erythrocyte sedimentation rate (ESR) and C-reactive protein (CRP) between the group using uric acid lowering agents and the group that was not using such agents. Moreover, the patients using ULT agents had lower serum uric acid level (standardized mean difference (SMD), - 0.73; 95% CI, -0.92 to -0.54; I 23%; P < 0.00001) and showed better adherence to medication (risk ratio (RR), 1.40; 95% CI, 1.18 to 1.65; I 0%; P < 0.0001) as compared with the patients not that were not using such agents. However, there was no substantial difference in the recurrence rate of acute gout attacks (RR, 0.84; 95% CI, 0.59 to 1.19; I 0%; P = 0.33).The evidence for this is, however, very moderate.\nCONCLUSION: Our finding shows that it is beneficial in many aspects to use uric-acid-lowering drugs at the initial stage of an acute gout attack. However, larger sample size studies are still needed to prove our results.\nTRIAL REGISTRATION: Registration number: PROSPERO (CRD42020153924).

We aimed to design and synthesize a more potent hURAT1 based on the structure of Lesinurad (LU), which was reported to lower uric acid levels with IC50 value of hURAT1 (about 60μM).\nMETHODS: A cell model was conducted and characterized via Real-time qRCR and Western blot. We synthesized and identified a new midazole analogue of LU. Cells stably-expressing hURAT1 or human organic anion transporter 1 (hOAT1) were used in the [C] urate or 6-carboxyfluorescein (6-CF) uptake assays to test the activities of the newly synthesized compound. The uric acid lowering effects of LU and LUM and their effects on urea nitrogen and creatinine in potassium oxonate-induced hyperuricemic rats were analyzed.\nRESULTS: The [C] Urate uptake assay using hURAT1 stably transfected MDCK cells indicated that LUM was more potent than LU against hURAT1, with IC50 values of 3.22μM and 65.47μM, respectively. LU and LUM also effectively suppressed hOAT1-mediated 6-CF uptake, and the IC50 hURAT1\/IC50 hOAT1 of LU and LUM was1.49 and 0.35 respectively, indicating a better selectivity for LUM than LU. In vivo, LUM-Na (40mg\/kg) showed more potent activity in reducing serum uric acid levels in potassium oxonate-induced hyperuricemic rats, compared to similar doses of LU-Na.\nCONCLUSION: LUM was demonstrated to be as potent a uricosuric drug as LU.",

Exciting new developments in the last decade have brought back the focus on this interesting, crystal-induced chronic inflammatory condition. New insights include the role of NALP3 inflammasome-induced inflammation in acute gout, the characterization of diagnostic signs on ultrasound and dual-energy computed tomography imaging modalities, the recognition of target serum urate less than 6 mg\/day as the goal for urate-lowering therapies, and evidence-based treatment guidelines. A better understanding of disease mechanisms has enabled drug discovery - three new urate-lowering drugs have been approved in the last decade, with several more in the pipeline.

        "Abstract":"While rasburicase has shown efficacy to rapidly correct hyperuricemia compared with allopurinol, its overall impact in improving clinically significant outcomes, such as acute kidney injury (AKI), in tumor lysis syndrome (TLS) is unknown. In this retrospective cohort study, we included all hospitalized cancer patients with hyperuricemia and AKI who received rasburicase +\/- allopurinol or allopurinol alone from 2009 to 2015. Inverse probability of treatment weighting using propensity score was used to account for potential confounders and to estimate the causal effect associated with differential drug treatment. 150 patients met inclusion criteria; 89 received rasburicase +\/- allopurinol and 61 received allopurinol alone. Weighted outcome regression analysis demonstrated that rasburicase was associated with significantly lower mean uric acid nadir at 7 days compared to allopurinol (2.70 versus 5.82 mg\/dL, p < 0.01). However, likelihood of renal function recovery (OR = 0.90, p = 0.79), creatinine nadir by 7 days (1.80 versus 1.66 mg\/dL, p = 0.51), and final creatinine by 30 days (2.08 versus 2.07 mg\/dL, p = 0.98) did not significantly differ. In conclusion, the clinical benefit of rasburicase in promoting renal function recovery in cancer patietns with concurrent hyperuricemia and renal failure remains inconclusive. Our results suggest that correction of hyperuricemia as a surrogate endpoint may not be associated with significant renal function improvement, particularly if renal dysfunction is unrelated to TLS.",

        "Abstract":"The management of gout consists of urate-lowering therapy and acute and chronic anti-inflammatory drugs. Allopurinol, a xanthine oxidase inhibitor, is the primary urate-lowering therapy employed for decades. Recent studies suggest cardiovascular disease and mortality, chronic kidney disease, prostate cancer, and manic symptoms are reduced in patients with gout treated with allopurinol. These findings support that allopurinol contributes to a variety of beneficial effects beyond urate lowering. This manuscript reviews the analgesic and anti-inflammatory properties of allopurinol, which are rarely discussed. Several mechanisms are suggested to confer these benefits including accumulation of adenosine and inhibitory effects of allopurinol on reactive oxygen species, tumor necrosis factor- α, nuclear factor kappa-light-chain-enhancer of activated B cells, and the NACHT, LRR and PYD domains-containing protein 3 (NLRP3) inflammasome. Also, allopurinol blocks the stimulating effects of thioredoxin-interacting protein and interacts directly with the redox-active domain of thioredoxin as a negative regulator, decreasing NLRP3 activation. The importance of allopurinol's analgesic and anti-inflammatory properties requires further study and the implications to patient care better understood.",

Subjects with CKD stage 1 experienced less sU lowering with 100 mg than 300 mg of allopurinol. Subjects with stage 4 and 5 CKD had equivalent sU decreases across the 100 mg and 300 mg allopurinol groups. However, the 100 mg group started at a higher pre-treatment sU and ended at a higher final sU than the 300 mg group.\nCONCLUSIONS: The strategy of titrating allopurinol to sU in patients with kidney impairment may result in greater sU lowering at lower doses than in patients without CKD but may also pose a treatment challenge from a possible drug ceiling effect.",

        "Abstract":"['2', '2', '2', '2', '2']\nIn this work, a highly efficient electrochemiluminescence (ECL) biosensor was developed based on the nanosponge-hydrogel system for uric acid (UA) detection. First, the nanosponge consisted of polylactic acid glycolic acid (PLGA) nanoparticles immobilized with MoS quantum dots (QDs) and urate oxidase (UAO). The marked loading capability of PLGA nanoparticles enables loading many biomolecules and QDs for the specific recognition of UA. Urate oxidase on the nanosponge can catalyze UA to generate H O in situ, which further triggers the ECL signal for the MoS QDs. Furthermore, the biocompatible acrylamide-based hydrogel not only effectively retained the functionalities of the chimeric nanosponge-hydrogel, but also provided structural integrity and engineering flexibility on the electrode for ECL sensing applications. In addition, there were many ester groups and amide bonds in the nanosponge-hydrogel structure. Therefore, many electron can be excited in the ECL process due to the large number of lone electron pairs on oxygen and nitrogen atoms. This resulted in a seven-fold ECL enhancement of the MoS QDs. Finally, the nanosponge-hydrogel structure-based ECL biosensor was successfully used in real clinical serum assays. This showed a good analytical performance for UA detection (100-500 μmol\/L) with a limit of detection of 20 μmol\/L.",

        "Abstract":"BACKGROUND: Although hyperuricemia is associated with chronic kidney disease, whether and how it should be managed for renoprotection remains debatable. Thus, we investigated whether allopurinol and febuxostat, the most frequently used urate-lowering treatments, have differential renoprotective effects on chronic kidney disease.\nMETHODS: Incident users of allopurinol and febuxostat were identified from two tertiary referral centers. One-to-one propensity score matching between the allopurinol and febuxostat groups was performed. Participants were followed up until the occurrence of clinical outcomes, urate-lowering agent discontinuation, mortality, or the end of the study period, whichever occurred first. The primary outcomes were a 30% decline in estimated glomerular filtration rate (eGFR) and end-stage renal disease. Differential trends of eGFR decline were estimated using a linear mixed-effects model.\nRESULTS: Each group included 654 participants. Baseline eGFRs were 40.1 [26.6-57.3] and 39.1 [27.9-58.3] mL\/min\/1.73 m2 in the allopurinol and febuxostat group, respectively. Adjusted least square mean change in serum urate was -1.58 mg\/dL [95% confidence interval (CI), -1.78 to -1.38] and -2.69 mg\/dL (95% CI, -2.89 to -2.49) in the allopurinol and febuxostat groups, respectively. Despite lower serum urate levels, febuxostat was significantly more associated with a 30% decline in eGFR (hazard ratio 1.26; 95% CI 1.03-1.54) and end-stage renal disease (hazard ratio 1.91, 95% CI 1.42-2.58) than allopurinol. Annual eGFR decline in febuxostat users was estimated to be more rapid than in allopurinol users by 2.14 (standard error 0.71) mL\/min\/1.73 m2 per year.\nCONCLUSIONS: Allopurinol demonstrated attenuation of chronic kidney disease progression and prevention of hypouricemia, compared to febuxostat. Because the treatment can be renoprotective, further studies on its effects on chronic kidney disease are required.",

        "Abstract":"OBJECTIVES: The current world witnesses a greatly increased prevalence and incidence of hyperuricemia and gout with unfortunately the comparative efficacy and safety of present available uricosuric agents remaining uncertain. We herein aimed to investigate the most appropriate uricosuric agent for gout or hyperuricemia patients.\nMETHOD: PubMed, Embase, Cochrane Library databases, and ClinicalTrials.gov from inception to 2 July 2022 were searched to retrieve eligible studies assessing efficacy and safety of uricosuric drugs in hyperuricemia or gout patients. Network meta-analysis was carried out using the Stata 16.0 software.\nRESULTS: Twelve randomized controlled trials comprising 1851 patients were eventually included. Network meta-analysis showed that dotinurad 4 mg once daily, verinurad, dotinurad 2 mg once daily, dotinurad 1 mg once daily, and benzbromarone were the top 5 effective treatments to achieve target serum uric acid. Furthermore, dotinurad 4 mg once daily was more effective at achieving urate-lowering targets (RR of dotinurad 4 mg once daily vs. probenecid: 1.68, 95% CI [1.13; 2.50]) and safer (RR of probenecid vs. dotinurad 4 mg once daily: 1.77, 95% CI [0.69; 4.56]) than probenecid.\nCONCLUSIONS: This network meta-analysis demonstrated an important absolute benefit of dotinurad 4 mg once daily to achieve target serum uric acid and low risk of adverse events for drug treatment of gout or hyperuricemia patients. Additionally, verinurad might be used as an alternative uricosuric therapeutic option to dotinurad. These findings provided further comprehensive insight into the treatment value of current uricosuric agents for gout or hyperuricemia. Key Points 1. This is the first systematic review and network meta-analysis examining the efficacy and safety of currently available uricosuric agents in gout or hyperuricemia patients. 2. Recommended doses of dotinurad 4mg once daily used for the treatment of gout or hyperuricemia patients can significantly decrease serum uric acid levels. 3. The present findings will provide further comprehensive insight into the treatment value of certain uricosuric agents for gout or hyperuricemia.",

She underwent a heart transplant at age 22 and has received prednisone, mycophenolate mofetil, and cyclosporine to prevent rejection since the transplant. The patient presented with numerous gouty tophi and elevated serum uric acid, likely precipitated by her immunosuppressant medications, and underwent a 38-week course of pegloticase infusions at 2-week intervals. After the first infusion, her serum uric acid decreased to <89 μmol\/L (<1.5 mg\/dL) and remained at this level throughout treatment. Her proximal tophi, and subsequently distal tophi, resolved over the course of treatment; she did not report any gout flares.

This article also summarizes any evidence of the association of patient perceptions to patient outcomes in gout.\nSUMMARY: A recognition of patient perspectives in gout has the potential to positively impact clinical care for gout. Discussion of disease impact, misperceptions about benefits\/harms of urate-lowering therapy (ULT), and patient values\/preferences regarding pharmacological and nonpharmacological treatments can lead to a better shared decision-making and improved outcomes in gout. These findings emphasize the importance of inclusion of patient perspective not only in clinical care and quality improvement and research initiatives but also in the design and implementation of the research agenda in gout. Inclusion of patient-reported outcomes in clinical research is likely to improve its relevance to patients with gout.",

Serum urate levels after treatment with verinurad plus febuxostat were 59.6% and 63.7% lower than after placebo at 12 and 24 weeks, respectively. No clinically meaningful changes were observed in estimated glomerular filtration rate or serum creatinine or serum cystatin C concentrations. Verinurad plus febuxostat was well tolerated.\nLIMITATIONS: Sample size and study duration were insufficient to evaluate definitive effects of verinurad plus febuxostat on UACR and glomerular filtration. Generalizability was limited by exclusion of patients with stages 4 and 5 chronic kidney disease.\nCONCLUSIONS: Verinurad plus febuxostat reduced albuminuria and lowered serum urate concentrations in patients with T2DM, albuminuria, and hyperuricemia. Definitive assessment of their combined impact on preservation of kidney function awaits larger clinical studies.\nFUNDING: This study was supported by AstraZeneca.\nTRIAL REGISTRATION: Registered at ClinicalTrials.gov with study number NCT03118739.",

        "Abstract":"Lowering serum urate levels below the threshold for crystal formation with urate-lowering therapy (ULT) has been associated with a lower risk for gout flare reoccurrences. However, gout patients on ULT still commonly suffer from recurring gout flares. The purpose of this study was to explore prognostic factors associated with gout flare recurrence within the first 3 months, in gout patients starting ULT during an acute gout flare. Post-hoc analysis of trial data on acute gout patients randomized to either gout flare standard of care or anakinra treatment were used, including baseline demographic, laboratory, clinical, and patient-reported variables, as well as 3-month follow-up data on gout flare recurrences. Only patients starting ULT at baseline were included. Using variable selection based on clinical relevance, univariate, and multivariate binary logistic regression analyses were done to examine predictors of gout flare reoccurrence. A total of 75 patients were included in this study, of which 36 (48%) experienced a gout flare ≤ 3 months post baseline. The multivariate regression analysis revealed that CRP levels > 30 mg\/L (OR 9.47) and lack of prophylaxis when starting ULT (OR 11.56) were independently associated with gout flare recurrence. Similar results were found for the univariate regression analyses. Our results show that CRP levels > 30 mg\/L and lack of prophylaxis when starting ULT were prognostic factors for early gout flare reoccurrence in patients starting ULT during an acute gout flare. KEY POINTS: • Gout flare recurrences were common within the first 3 months after starting urate-lowering therapy in gout patients. • Intake of prophylaxis when starting ULT had a strong protective effect on gout flare recurrences. • C-reactive protein level > 30 mg\/L was an additional prognostic factor for early (≤ 3 months) gout flare reoccurrence in patients starting ULT during an acute gout flare.",

        "Abstract":"Previous research has investigated whether hyperuricemia serves as an independent risk factor for cardiovascular and renal diseases. Hyperuricemia is defined as an abnormally high level of uric acid (UA; i.e., serum urate level > 6.8 mg\/dL). Hyperuricemia has been considered a complication of chronic kidney disease (CKD). However, it seems to play a pathogenic role in the progression of renal diseases. There has been increasing focus on the link between hyperuricemia and CKD. The results of randomized controlled trials have implied independent associations between hyperuricemia and the progression of cardiovascular and renal morbidities. These associations may be mediated by renin-angiotensin system activation, nitric oxide synthase inhibition, and macrovascular\/microvascular disease development. There remains controversy regarding the use of serum UA level as an indirect index of renal vascular disease. This literature review focuses on the role of asymptomatic hyperuricemia in the progression of CKD, as well as the association between hyperuricemia and cardiovascular disease. It also provides a general overview of the physiological metabolism of UA.",

        "Abstract":"PURPOSE: Verinurad (RDEA3170) is a selective uric acid reabsorption inhibitor in clinical development for treatment of gout and asymptomatic hyperuricemia. This study evaluated verinurad pharmacokinetics, pharmacodynamics, and tolerability in healthy Japanese and non-Asian adult male subjects.\nMETHODS: This was a Phase I, randomized, single-blind, placebo-controlled study. Panels of 8 Japanese subjects were randomized to receive oral verinurad (2.5-15 mg) or placebo administered as a single dose in a fasted and fed state and as once-daily doses for 7 days in a fed state. Eight non-Asian subjects received verinurad 10 mg as a single dose (fasted and fed) and multiple doses in the fed state. Serial plasma\/serum and urine samples were assayed for verinurad and uric acid. Safety was assessed by adverse events and laboratory data.\nRESULTS: Of 48 randomized subjects, 46 (Japanese, 39; non-Asian, 7) completed the study. Following single or multiple doses in Japanese subjects, maximum plasma concentration () and area under the plasma concentration-time curve (AUC) increased in a near dose-proportional manner. Time to  () was ~1.25-2.0 hours with fasting. A moderate-fat meal delayed  (range 3.0-5.0 hours) and had a variable effect on AUC (0%-97% increase) and  (0%-26% increase) across the dose groups. Following multiple verinurad 10 mg doses,  and AUC were 38% and 23% higher, respectively, in Japanese vs non-Asian subjects, largely due to body weight differences. Mean reduction of serum urate following multiple verinurad 10 mg doses was 46% and 44% after 24 hours in Japanese and non-Asian subjects, respectively. Verinurad was well tolerated at all doses.\nCONCLUSION: Verinurad monotherapy lowered serum urate and was well tolerated in both healthy Japanese and non-Asian males, while small differences in plasma pharmacokinetics were observed.

Rasburicase, a recombinant urate oxidase, is a common treatment for hyperuricemia from different etiologies. There are scarce reports on rasburicase treatment for neonatal Acute Kidney Injury (AKI) with hyperuricemia to prevent renal damage secondary to hyperuricemia. Herein we report a case of neonatal AKI with hyperuricemia that was treated with a single dose of rasburicase. Serum uric acid declined immediately after rasburicase infusion and remained in the normal range since then. In contrast to previous reports, the normalization of uric acid levels was not accompanied by recovery from AKI and serum creatinine levels remained elevated for a long period. The neonate recovered from AKI only 2 weeks post rasburicase treatment. This case report highlights the importance of uric acid levels in neonatal AKI and suggests treatment with rasburicase in cases of hyperuricemia and acute kidney injury in neonates.",

        "Abstract":"As an important part of the comprehensive treatment methods, the urate-lowering Chinese herbs could provide favorable clinical effects on hyperuricemia in its ability to invigorate spleen and remove dampness. Owing to the long-term duration, it brought up the potential adverse reactions (ADRs) and concerns about the drug-induced liver injury from these herbs. To address this problem, the bioinformatics approaches which combined the network pharmacology, computer simulation and molecular biology experiments were undertaken to elucidate the underlying drug-induced liver injury molecular mechanisms of urate-lowering Chinese herbs. Several electronic databases were searched to identify the potential liver injury compounds in published research. Then, the putative target profile of liver injury was predicted, and the interaction network was constructed based on the links between the compounds, corresponding targets and core pathways. Accordingly, the molecular docking simulation was performed to recognize the representative compounds with hepatotoxicity. Finally, the cell experiments were conducted to investigate the biochemical indicators and expression of the crucial protein that were closely associated with liver injury. In conclusion, the current research revealed that the compounds with potential liver injury including diosgenin, baicalin, saikosaponin D, tetrandrine, rutaecarpine and evodiamine from urate-lowering Chinese herbs, could lead to decline the survival rate of L-02 cell, increase the activities of aspartate aminotransferase (AST), alanine aminotransferase (ALT), lactate dehydrogenase (LDH) and alkaline phosphatase (ALP) in cell-culture medium, enhance the expression of p-p38\/p38, while the p38 inhibitor could achieve the trend of regulating and controlling liver injury. These research findings bring further support to the growing evidence that the mechanism of the liver injury induced by the compounds from urate-lowering Chinese herbs may be associated with the activation of p38α.",

Common causes of hyperuricemia, in addition to hereditary reduced renal excretion of urate, include purine over-nutrition, aging, comorbidities and associated medications, some of which increase serum urate levels. The first gout flare represents the signal for deposited urate crystals. If hyperuricemia remains untreated, crystal deposition proceeds and can cause recurrent gout flares, joint destruction and tophi. There is evidence that silent inflammation is ongoing even during asymptomatic stages. Gout patients often exhibit other metabolic, renal and cardiovascular co-morbidities and have higher (cardiovascular) mortality. Therefore, guidelines call for consequent urate lowering strategies to bring serum urate levels to a target at least below 360 µmol\/l.

All patients were treated using a T2T strategy according to national gout guidelines to achieve the target levels of serum uric acid (sUA; < 5-6 mg\/dl) within 6 months of the first visit. The primary outcome was to assess changes in eGFR. The effects of independent variables were analyzed over eGFR in a linear mixed-effects (LME) model. Fifty patients with gout and CKD stage 3 treated with XOIs with a T2T strategy for 12 months were included. Eighty-two percent of the patients achieved the sUA target during the study period.

Lowering of the serum urate level with allopurinol may slow the decrease in the glomerular filtration rate (GFR) in persons with type 1 diabetes and early-to-moderate diabetic kidney disease.\nMETHODS: In a double-blind trial, we randomly assigned participants with type 1 diabetes, a serum urate level of at least 4.5 mg per deciliter, an estimated GFR of 40.0 to 99.9 ml per minute per 1.73 m of body-surface area, and evidence of diabetic kidney disease to receive allopurinol or placebo. The primary outcome was the baseline-adjusted GFR, as measured with iohexol, after 3 years plus a 2-month washout period. Secondary outcomes included the decrease in the iohexol-based GFR per year and the urinary albumin excretion rate after washout. Safety was also assessed.\nRESULTS: A total of 267 patients were assigned to receive allopurinol and 263 to receive placebo. The mean age was 51.1 years, the mean duration of diabetes 34.6 years, and the mean glycated hemoglobin level 8.2%. The mean baseline iohexol-based GFR was 68.7 ml per minute per 1.73 m in the allopurinol group and 67.3 ml per minute per 1.73 m in the placebo group. During the intervention period, the mean serum urate level decreased from 6.1 to 3.9 mg per deciliter with allopurinol and remained at 6.1 mg per deciliter with placebo. After washout, the between-group difference in the mean iohexol-based GFR was 0.001 ml per minute per 1.73 m (95% confidence interval [CI], -1.9 to 1.9; P = 0.99). The mean decrease in the iohexol-based GFR was -3.0 ml per minute per 1.73 m per year with allopurinol and -2.5 ml per minute per 1.73 m per year with placebo (between-group difference, -0.6 ml per minute per 1.73 m per year; 95% CI, -1.5 to 0.4). The mean urinary albumin excretion rate after washout was 40% (95% CI, 0 to 80) higher with allopurinol than with placebo. The frequency of serious adverse events was similar in the two groups.\nCONCLUSIONS: We found no evidence of clinically meaningful benefits of serum urate reduction with allopurinol on kidney outcomes among patients with type 1 diabetes and early-to-moderate diabetic kidney disease.

        "Abstract":"OBJECTIVE: There is increasing evidence to show that hyperuricemia may have a pathogenic role in the progression of renal diseases. We performed a prospective, randomized, controlled trial to investigate the renal effects of allopurinol treatment in hyperuricemic patients with end-stage renal disease (ESRD) who undergo peritoneal dialysis.\nMETHODS: This was a unicenter, randomized, controlled clinical trial conducted in \"Alzahra Hospital, Isfahan, Iran.\" Patients were randomly assigned into treatment or control group. Treatment-group patients were administered a starting allopurinol dose of 100 mg\/day. The dose was adjusted according to serum uric acid level, aiming to maintain uric acid levels within the normal range. Participants were followed up for 6 months after receiving the medicine. Residual renal function (RRF) was assessed by measuring the renal component of Kt\/V urea and estimating the patient's glomerular filtration rate (GFR) by calculating the mean of urea and creatinine clearance. In addition, systolic and diastolic blood pressure and serum level of creatinine were measured every 3 months during the follow-up period.\nFINDINGS: Eighty patients were enrolled in the study and divided into two groups, including 40 ESRD patients receiving allopurinol and 40 ESRD did not receive allopurinol and considered as the control group. GFR measurements showed that there was not a significant difference between patients' RRF of two groups. However, allopurinol group had higher RRF than the control group during the follow-up period. Evaluating RRF by Kt\/V showed the same results.\nCONCLUSION: Our study demonstrated significant effects of allopurinol on decreasing serum levels of uric acid in ESRD patients undergoing peritoneal dialysis.

        "Abstract":"AIM: This thorough QT\/QTc (TQT) study was conducted to evaluate the risk of QT prolongation for verinurad when combined with allopurinol. Verinurad is a novel, urate anion exchanger 1 inhibitor that reduces serum urate levels by promoting urinary excretion of uric acid. It is co-administered with a xanthine oxidase inhibitor.\nMETHODS: The TQT study (NCT04256629) was a randomized, placebo-controlled, double-blind, three-period, crossover study, conducted in healthy volunteers. A total of 24 participants received single doses of verinurad 24 mg extended release, 40 mg immediate release formulation (both co-administered with allopurinol 300 mg), and matching placebos. The primary endpoint was baseline- and placebo-adjusted Fridericia-corrected QTcF interval (ΔΔQTcF) at the concentration of interest. A prespecified linear mixed-effects concentration-QTc model was used to estimate the primary endpoint. Time-matched 12-lead digital electrocardiograms and plasma concentrations were measured at baseline and up to 48 h after dose in each participant.\nRESULTS: Estimated ΔΔQTcF at the highest clinically relevant scenario (76 ng\/mL) was -2.7 msec (90% confidence interval [CI]: -4.6, -0.8). Furthermore, the upper 90% ΔΔQTcF CI was estimated to be below 10 msec at all observed verinurad concentrations. Supratherapeutic verinurad dose was used to achieve exposures eightfold higher than the highest clinically relevant exposure, thus waiving the need for positive control.\nCONCLUSIONS: As the effect on ΔΔQTcF was below the threshold for regulatory concern (10 msec) at the supratherapeutic exposure, it can be concluded that verinurad and allopurinol treatment does not induce QTcF prolongation at the highest clinically relevant exposures.",

        "Abstract":"['4mm', '4mm']\nPrevious studies reported that elevated serum uric acid level was associated with greater coronary lipid plaque. Xanthine oxidoreductase (XOR) is a rate-limiting enzyme in purine metabolism and is believed to play important roles in coronary atherosclerosis. However, the relation between XOR and coronary lipid plaque is unclear. Patients with stable coronary artery disease who underwent elective percutaneous coronary intervention under near-infrared spectroscopy intravascular ultrasound (NIRS-IVUS) guidance were prospectively included. They were divided into 3 groups according to plasma XOR activities based on a previous report: low, normal, and high. Quantitative coronary angiography and gray-scale IVUS were analyzed. The primary end point was coronary lipid plaques in a nontarget vessel assessed by NIRS-IVUS with lipid core burden index (LCBI) and maximum LCBI in 4 mm (maxLCBI). Out of 68 patients, 26, 31, and 11 patients were classified as low, normal, and high XOR activity groups. Quantitative coronary angiography demonstrated that the high XOR activity group had longer lesion length, smaller minimum lumen diameter, and higher percentage of diameter stenosis in a nontarget vessel among the 3 groups. Gray-scale IVUS analysis also showed smaller lumen area in the high XOR activity group than the others. LCBI (102.1 ± 56.5 vs 65.6 ± 48.5 vs 55.6 ± 37.8, p = 0.04) and maxLCBI (474.4 ± 171.6 vs 347.4 ± 181.6, 294.0 ± 155.9, p = 0.04) in a nontarget vessel were significantly higher in the high XOR group than in the normal and low groups. In conclusion, elevated XOR activity was associated with coronary lipid-rich plaque in a nontarget vessel in patients with stable coronary artery disease.",

Both HFrEF and HF with preserved ejection fraction (HFpEF) are associated with poor outcomes. We investigated the effect of topiroxostat, an oral xanthine oxidoreductase inhibitor, for HFpEF patients with hyperuricemia or gout.\nMETHODS: In this nonrandomized, open-label, single-arm trial, we administered topiroxostat 40-160 mg\/day to HFpEF patients with hyperuricemia or gout to achieve a target uric acid level of 6.0 mg\/dL. The primary outcome was rate of change in log-transformed brain natriuretic peptide (BNP) level from baseline to 24 weeks after topiroxostat treatment. The secondary outcomes included amount of change in BNP level, uric acid evaluation values, and oxidative stress marker levels after 24 weeks of topiroxostat treatment. Thirty-six patients were enrolled; three were excluded before study initiation.\nRESULTS: Change in log-transformed BNP level was -3.4 ± 8.9% (p = 0.043) after 24 weeks of topiroxostat treatment. The rate of change for the decrease in BNP level was -18.0 (-57.7, 4.0 pg\/mL; p = 0.041).

Key exclusion criteria included MTX contraindication, current immunosuppressant use, G6PDH deficiency, and estimated glomerular filtration rate <40 ml\/minute\/1.73 m . Patients were randomized 2:1 to 52 weeks of pegloticase (8 mg biweekly) with either oral MTX (15 mg\/week) or placebo. The primary end point was the proportion of treatment responders during month 6 (defined as serum urate <6 mg\/dl for ≥80% of visits during weeks 20-24). Efficacy was evaluated in all randomized patients (intent-to-treat population), and safety was evaluated in all patients receiving ≥1 blinded MTX or placebo dose.\nRESULTS: A total of 152 patients were randomized, 100 to receive pegloticase plus MTX, 52 to receive pegloticase plus placebo. Significantly higher treatment response occurred during month 6 in the MTX group versus the placebo group (71.0% [71 of 100 patients] versus 38.5% [20 of 52 patients], respectively; between-group difference 32.3% [95% confidence interval 16.3%, 48.3%]) (P < 0.0001 for between-group difference). During the first 6 months of pegloticase plus MTX or pegloticase plus placebo treatment, 78 (81.3%) of 96 MTX patients versus 47 (95.9%) of 49 placebo patients experienced ≥1 adverse event (AE), most commonly gout flare (64 [66.7%] of 96 MTX patients and 34 [69.4%] of 49 placebo patients). Reports of AEs and serious AEs were comparable between groups, but the infusion reaction rate was considerably lower with MTX cotherapy (4.2% [4 of 96 MTX patients, including 1 patient who had anaphylaxis]) than with placebo cotherapy (30.6% [15 of 49 placebo patients, 0 who had anaphylaxis]) (P < 0.001). Antidrug antibody positivity was also lower in the MTX group.\nCONCLUSION: MTX cotherapy markedly increased pegloticase response rate over placebo (71.0% versus 38.5%) during month 6 with no new safety signals. These findings verify higher treatment response rate, lower infusion reaction incidence, and lower immunogenicity when pegloticase is coadministered with MTX.",

        "Abstract":"50\nHyperuricemia is a kind of metabolic disease resulted from imbalance between urate production and excretion. Xanthine oxidase (XOD) or renal urate transporter 1 (URAT1) inhibitors have been applied for hyperuricemia treatment in clinic, but available drugs could not simultaneously target XOD and URAT1 and had various adverse effects. (E)-2-(4-bromophenyl)-1-(2, 4-dihydroxyphenyl)ethanone oxime (BDEO), as a deoxybenzoins oxime analog, was obtained from a cluster of deoxybenzoins derivatives synthesized by our research group with potent anti-hyperuricemic activity, which was expected to be dual inhibitor of XOD and URAT1. This study aimed to investigate effects of BDEO on XOD and URAT1 in vitro, as well as the possible mechanism by which BDEO attenuated hyperuricemia in vivo. In vitro, BDEO obviously inhibited XOD activity with an IC value of 3.33μM, moreover, in Human embryonic kidney (HEK)293 cells expressing URAT1, BDEO and benzbromarone blocked uptake of uric acid with a Ki value of 0.145μM. On the other hand, mice were orally administrated by oxonate for seven consecutive days to induce hyperuricemia, BDEO at various doses were administered intragastrically to hyperuricemic and normal mice daily. BDEO dose-dependently decreased serum urate level and uric acid excretion in 24h in hyperuricemic mice. More importantly, BDEO significantly suppressed hepatic XOD activity and down-regulated renal URAT1 protein level in hyperuricemic mice. Notably, BDEO exhibited no effects on all these detected biochemical indicators in normal mice, predicting its safety. Taken together, the data suggested that BDEO may serve as a dual XOD and URAT1 inhibitor for treatment of hyperuricemia.",

Urate-lowering therapy is used to treat gout by reducing serum uric acid levels. However, adherence to urate-lowering therapy among patients remains poor. To date, there have been no available studies based on a conceptual framework that examined factors influencing medication adherence in patients with gout.\nDESIGN: Cross-sectional, descriptive correlational study.\nMETHODS: A convenience sample of outpatients (n = 108) was recruited between October 2014-January 2015 from a tertiary hospital in Singapore. Outcomes were measured by relevant valid and reliable instruments. Descriptive statistics and parametric tests including multiple linear regression were used to analyse the data.\nRESULTS: Although 44.4% of the participants were high adherers to urate-lowering therapy, the mean adherence level was moderate. Significant differences in medication adherence scores were found among the subgroups of gender, ethnicity, marital status, employment status and presence of comorbidity. Medication adherence was positively significantly correlated with age, number of comorbidities and beliefs about medicines. Linear regression showed that higher level of beliefs about medicines, presence of comorbidity and being married were factors positively influencing medication adherence.\nCONCLUSIONS: This study revealed moderate adherence to urate-lowering therapy in patients with gout in Singapore, indicating the need for strategies to improve adherence by considering its main influencing factors. Future research should be conducted to develop interventions targeted at modifying patients' beliefs about medicines in order to improve medication adherence.\nRELEVANCE TO CLINICAL PRACTICE: Findings from this study allow healthcare providers to quickly and easily identify patients who may have low adherence. Nurses should take the lead in educating patients on the mechanism of urate-lowering therapy and highlight the importance of adhering to it.",

Target sUA was further assessed by subgroup analysis of urate-lowering therapy (ULT) prescriptions and outcomes, stratified by renal function.\nRESULTS: Patients achieving target sUA tended toward older, female, higher ULT dose, higher adherence, more comorbidities, and\/or antidiabetic drugs prescribed. Renal dysfunction and\/or diuretic prescriptions were associated with reduced achievement of target sUA. Severe renal dysfunction was particularly influential (odds ratio [OR] = 0.22 [95% confidence interval (CI): 0.10-0.48] for <15, 0.15 [0.10-0.23] for ≥15 to <30, compared with eGFR ≥90 mL\/min\/1.73 m ). Across all renal function categories, mean prescribed ULT dose was low (febuxostat 17.0-21.0 mg\/day, allopurinol 123.1-139.6 mg\/day), and target sUA achievement was reduced among renal dysfunction patients. Gouty arthritis was more likely in patients with a prior history of such occurrences, and less likely for higher ULT adherence, sUA monitored regularly at medical facilities, and\/or more comorbidities.\nCONCLUSION: In a real-world setting, severe renal dysfunction is the most important risk factor for failure to achieve the target sUA, suggesting suboptimal disease management in patients with gout or hyperuricemia complicated by this condition. Findings associated with gouty arthritis suggest that these occurrences could be successfully managed by regular monitoring of sUA and closer adherence to ULT.",

Every 3 weeks, the dosage of the drug was increased by 50 mg to 300 mg per day under the control of the level of serum uric acid (sUA). The total daily dose of the drug movalis, used in the form of different dosage forms, was 7.515 mg. The clinical effectiveness of the treatment was evaluated after 3, 6, 9 and 12 weeks according to physical examination, the dynamics of joint pain at rest, during movement and palpation, according to the visual analogue scale (VAS) in millimeters, Likert scale, EuroQol-5D-5L questionnaire, care for oneself, habitual daily activities, the presence of anxiety and depression, assessment of satisfaction with treatment (on a scale of 1 to 5, where 1 is the complete absence of improvement or worsening, and 5 is a very good result); took into account the period of remission, as well as the time before the onset of relapse of gouty arthritis. An adverse event (AE) was recorded.\nRESULTS AND DISCUSSION: On the background of treatment with movalis 7.5 mg per day more than two-thirds of patients showed no worsening of the articular syndrome with an increase in the dose of allopurinol to 300 mg per day. By the 12th week of observation, a significant difference was found between the severity of gouty arthritis characteristics in the direction of improving mobility, self-care, normal daily activities, reducing soreness, reducing anxiety and depression (p0.05).

Moreover, TbUox exhibits high thermostability from 10 to 65 °C, with Tm of 70.3 °C and near-neutral pH stability from pH 7.0 to 8.0 and high thermal tolerance. The crystal structures of TbUox revealed a distinct feature of the C-terminal loop extensions that may help with protein stability via inter-subunit interactions. In addition, the high thermal tolerance of TbUox may be contributed by the extensive inter-subunit contacts via salt bridges, hydrogen bonds, and hydrophobic interactions. The findings in this study provide a molecular basis for the thermophilic TbUox urate oxidase for application in hyperuricemia and gout therapy.",

        "Abstract":"AIM: Gout is the most common form of inflammatory arthritis in men. Despite the availability of effective urate-lowering therapies (ULT), the management of gout is suboptimal due to poor persistence with ULT. This study examined national prescribing patterns of ULT to determine persistence with allopurinol in Australia.\nMETHODS: A 10% sample of the Australian Pharmaceutical Benefits Scheme dispensing claims database was used to identify individuals initiated on allopurinol between April 2014 and December 2019. The number of allopurinol scripts dispensed was used to estimate persistence with allopurinol. Persistence was defined as the number of months from initiation until discontinuation (last prescription with no further scripts acquired for a period thereafter). Kaplan-Meier curves were used to examine persistence, while Cox regression analysis was used to examine the influence of gender, concomitant colchicine and age.\nRESULTS: The largest drop in persistence occurred immediately after initiation, with 34% of patients discontinuing allopurinol 300-mg therapy in the first month. Median persistence with allopurinol 300 mg was 5 months (95% confidence interval 4.76-5.24), with around 63% of individuals not persisting with this therapy for more than 12 months. Concomitant prescription of colchicine on the day of allopurinol initiation only occurred in 7% of allopurinol initiations. No increase in persistence was observed for those co-prescribed colchicine.\nCONCLUSION: Persistence with allopurinol was poor. More effective methods targeting prescribers, patients and systems are required to promote persistence with allopurinol. Improving persistence to allopurinol is an important public health goal given the proven potential of this medication to eliminate gout.",

After rigorous evaluation on quality, the data was extracted from included publications.\nRESULTS: A total of 10 articles involving 6989 subjects were included, with 4841 receiving febuxostat and 2148 using allopurinol. The pooled analysis showed that the febuxostat group (40, 80, or 120 mg QD) was greater in reducing serum urate levels than the allopurinol group (200 or 300 mg) (RR=1.56, 95% CI=1.37-1.78, P<0.00001). In addition, daily dosing of febuxostat 80 mg had greater efficacy to that of febuxostat 40 mg (RR=1.47, 95% CI=1.34-1.60, P<0.00001), and febuxostat 120 mg\/day was associated with lower serum urate levels versus febuxostat 80 mg\/day (RR=1.08, 95% CI=1.02-1.13, P=0.004). In terms of the adverse events, the pooling overall adverse events data did achieve advantage in the febuxostat group (RR=0.96, 95% CI=0.92-1.00, P=0.04). While, liver function test abnormalitie , diarrhea, skin rashes, musculoskeletal and connective tissue disorders, gastrointestinal disorders, headaches, the statistical significance between the two groups fail to be achieved (P≥0.05).\nCONCLUSION: Febuxostat was superior in reducing the serum urate levels of hyperuricemic patients, while with an acceptable tolerability profile than allopurinol. Moreover, our result suggested that dose titration to febuxostat 120 mg daily was superior to other daily dosing with regard to urate-lowering efficacy.",

        "Abstract":"PURPOSE: This network meta-analysis aimed to assess the current efficacy of decreasing the uric acid (UA) level with drugs to reduce mortality in patients with heart failure (HF).\nMETHODS: Electronic literature searches using EMBASE and MEDLINE of studies published from 1 Jan 1950 to 26 Dec 2019 were conducted for randomized controlled trials or non-randomized cohort studies that included at least one group of patients who took UA-lowering drugs and with a study outcome of all-cause mortality. A random-effects network meta-analysis was performed within a frequentist framework. Hierarchy of treatments was expressed as the surface under the cumulative ranking curve (SUCRA) value, which is in proportion to mean rank (best is 100%).\nRESULTS: Nine studies, which included seven different types of groups, were eligible for analysis. The \"untreated uricemia\" group in which patients had hyperuricemia but without treatment had a significantly higher risk of mortality than the \"no uricemia\" group in which patients had no hyperuricemia (relative risk (RR)(95% confidence interval (CI), 1.43 (1.08-1.89)). The \"start-allo\" group wherein patients started to take allopurinol did not have a significantly lower risk of mortality than the \"untreated uricemia\" group (RR (95% CI), 0.68 (0.45-1.01)). However, in the \"start-allo\" group the SUCRA value was comparable to that in the \"no uricemia\" group (SUCRA: 65.4% for \"start-allo\"; 64.1% for \"no uricemia\").\nCONCLUSIONS: Results suggested that allopurinol therapy was not associated with a significantly improved prognosis in terms of mortality but could potentially counteract the adverse effects associated with longstanding hyperuricemia in HF patients.",

        "Abstract":"PURPOSE: Allopurinol is a potent inhibitor of the enzyme xanthine oxidase used primarily in the treatment of hyperuricemia and gout. The aim of this study was to compare the analgesic efficacy of preanesthetic allopurinol versus placebo on postoperative pain and anxiety in patients undergoing abdominal hysterectomy.\nMETHODS: This is a prospective, double-blinded, placebo-controlled, randomized clinical trial. We investigated 54 patients scheduled to undergo elective abdominal hysterectomy. Patients were randomly assigned to receive either oral allopurinol 300 mg (n = 27) or placebo (n = 27) the night before and 1 h before surgery. Patients were submitted to evaluation of pain and anxiety before the treatment, for 24 h postoperatively, 30 and 90 days after surgery. Cerebrospinal fluid was collected at the time of the spinal anesthesia to perform the measurement of the central levels of purines.\nRESULTS: Preoperative administration of allopurinol was effective in reducing postoperative pain 2 h after surgery. Allopurinol caused a reduction of approximately 40% in pain scores measured by the visual analogue pain scale after surgery (p < 0.05). No differences were found between groups in anxiety scores after surgery. There was a significant change in the cerebrospinal fluid concentrations of xanthine and uric acid before surgery (p < 0.01).\nCONCLUSION: This study showed a short-term benefit of the use of allopurinol as a preanesthetic medication since it was related to a reduction on pain scores 2 h after surgery.

Lately, however, a new therapeutic alternative has become available for the management of this pathology: lesinurad, a urate transporter inhibitor.\nOBJECTIVE: To objective of this study was to evaluate the cost effectiveness of lesinurad\/allopurinol in comparison with febuxostat as a second-line therapeutic strategy for the management of patients affected by gout and hyperuricemia that did not respond to a first-line therapy based on allopurinol alone.\nMETHODS: A Markov model was built based on the natural history of the pathology; patients entered the model according to their level of serum uric acid concentration and flowed across it according to their response to the therapy. The analysis was carried out considering the perspective of the Italian National Health Service on a lifetime horizon and 6-month cycles. Costs and quality-adjusted life-years (QALYs) were discounted at a 3.5% yearly rate. The results of the model were expressed in terms of incremental cost-effectiveness ratio (ICER). Both a one-way and a multi-way Monte-Carlo analysis were carried out in order to check the robustness of the results achieved.\nRESULTS: The ICER derived from the comparison was equal to €77.53\/QALY on the lifetime horizon, as there was a higher level of costs associated with the combination as compared with febuxostat (€10,658.27 vs. €10,645.87, for a differential of €12.40) and a higher level of QALYs achieved (7.77 vs. 7.61, for a differential of 0.16).\nCONCLUSIONS: The lesinurad\/allopurinol combination is recommended for the treatment of patients affected by gout\/hyperuricemia in the Italian Health System as it appears to be cost effective and thus sustainable for the Italian healthcare sector.",

        "Abstract":"The treatment of gout is based on several principles. Symptom control and termination of the inflammatory process are important early goals, whereas the urate level should be lowered in the long term to prevent further gout attacks and complications. The non-pharmacological approach is based on individually informing the patient on dietary measures and changes of life style. Besides physical measures, such as cold applications on the affected joint, various medications are available for treatment of an acute gout attack. The choice of drug depends on the individual risk profile. If non-steroidal anti-inflammatory drugs (NSAID) and coxibs are chosen it should be taken into account that the use is restricted in patients with renal insufficiency. Moreover, these drugs may have gastrointestinal side effects and are associated with increased cardiovascular morbidity and mortality. Colchicine has gastrointestinal side effects at high dosages but can also be used for differential diagnostics if there is a quick response to treatment. Steroids are an effective alternative and can be given orally or parenterally in patients with dysphagia. Moreover, steroids can be used in cases of renal insufficiency. After symptoms of the acute attack have subsided, urate lowering therapy should be initiated to prevent further attacks. Low-dose urate lowering therapy can be started during an acute gout attack when acute therapy is initiated. Allopurinol is still the medication of choice but its use is restricted in patients with renal insufficiency. A rare but serious side effect is allopurinol hypersensitivity syndrome. Febuxostat can be an alternative in patients who do not tolerate allopurinol. In February 2016, lesinurad, an URAT-1 and OAT-4 inhibitor, was approved in combination with allopurinol or febuxostat. Data on the effectiveness and safety of synthetic uricases and biologicals are still sparse for elderly patients. These substances are reserved for severe cases of gout.",

Adenine-induced hyperuricemic mice were administered with fucoidan, allopurinol and vehicle control respectively to compare the effects of the drugs. Serum uric acid, urea nitrogen, hepatorenal functions, activities of hepatic adenosine deaminase (ADA), xanthine oxidase (XOD), renal urate transporter 1 (URAT1) and NF-κB p65 were assessed. As the serum uric acid, urea nitrogen, creatinine, glutamic oxalacetic transaminase (GOT), glutamic pyruvic transaminase (GPT), superoxide dismutase (SOD), catalase (CAT) and malondialdehyde (MDA) data demonstrated, the adenine not only mediated hepatorenal function disorders, but also induced hyperuricemia in mice. Meanwhile, activities of hepatic ADA and XOD were markedly augmented by adenine, and the expression of URAT1 was promoted, which was conducive to the reabsorption of urate. However, exposure to fucoidan completely reversed those adenine-induced negative alternations in mice, and the activities of hepatic ADA and XOD were recovered to the normal level. It was obvious that hepatic and renal functions were protected by fucoidan treatment. The expression of URAT1 was returned to normal, resulting in an increase of renal urate excretion and consequent healing of adenine-induced hyperuricemia in mice. Expression and activation of NF-κB p65 was promoted in kidneys of adenine treated mice, but suppressed in kidneys of mice exposed to fucoidan from  or allopurinol. In conclusion, the fucoidan is a potential therapeutic agent for the treatment of hyperuricemia through dual regulatory roles on inhibition of hepatic metabolism and promotion of renal excretion of urate.",

Subjects with sUA ≥8.0 mg\/dL were identified, and disease status (prescriptions for urate-lowering therapy (ULT), occurrence of gout flare, sUA) was investigated for 1 year. Time to first onset and incidence rate of gout flare were determined by disease status subgroups for 2 years or more. The relationship between gout flare and sUA control was assessed using multivariable analysis.\nRESULTS: The analysis population was 19 261 subjects who met eligibility criteria. We found fewer occurrences of gout flare, for both gout and asymptomatic hyperuricaemia, in patients who achieved sUA ≤6.0 mg\/dL with ULT than in patients whose sUA remained >6.0 mg\/dL or who were not receiving ULT.

        "Abstract":"Gout is an inflammatory disease manifested by the deposition of monosodium urate (MSU) crystals in joints, cartilage, synovial bursa, tendons or soft tissues. Gout is not a new disease, which was first documented nearly 5,000 years ago. The prevalence of gout has increased globally in recent years, imposing great disease burden worldwide. Moreover, gout or hyperuricemia is clearly associated with a variety of comorbidities, including cardiovascular diseases, chronic kidney disease, urolithiasis, metabolic syndrome, diabetes mellitus, thyroid dysfunction, and psoriasis. To prevent acute arthritis attacks and complications, earlier use of pharmacotherapeutic treatment should be considered, and patients with hyperuricemia and previous episodes of acute gouty arthritis should receive long-term urate-lowering treatment. Urate-lowering drugs should be used during the inter-critical and chronic stages to prevent recurrent gout attacks, which may elicit gradual resolution of tophi. The goal of urate-lowering therapy should aim to maintain serum uric acid (sUA) level <6.0 mg\/dL. For patients with tophi, the initial goal can be set at lowering sUA to <5.0 mg\/dL to promote tophi dissolution. The goal of this consensus paper was to improve gout and hyperuricemia management at a more comprehensive level. The content of this consensus paper was developed based on local epidemiology and current clinical practice, as well as consensuses from two multidisciplinary meetings and recommendations from Taiwan Guideline for the Management of Gout and Hyperuricemia.",

Following DECT, treatment regimen was modified to gout-specific therapy in 52% of the patients.\nDISCUSSION: The ability to make a definite diagnosis of gout by DECT imaging in a substantial number of asymptomatic patients in the intercritical period should help in treatment decision-making and improve patient adherence to long-term urate-lowering therapy.",

        "Abstract":"With increased unhealthy dietary patterns and a sedentary lifestyle, the prevalence of hyperuricemia is growing rapidly, placing a tremendous burden on the public health system. Persistent hyperuricemia in extreme cases induces gout, gouty arthritis, and other metabolic diseases. Benzbromarone is a potent human urate transporter 1 (URAT1) inhibitor that is widely used as a uric acid-lowering drug. Recent studies indicated that benzbromarone can also activate farnesoid X receptor (FXR), whereas its agonistic activity on FXR is rather poor. Mounting evidence suggested that the etiology of gout is directly related to NOD-like receptor thermal protein domain associated protein 3 (NLRP3) inflammasomes, and FXR suppresses the expression of NLRP3 in various ways. Therefore, the dual URAT1 inhibitor and FXR agonist may exert synergistic effects on decreasing uric acid (UA) levels and inhibiting inflammation. To obtain a better dual URAT1 inhibitor and FXR agonist, we performed the structure-based drug design (SBDD) strategy to improve the FXR activation of benzbromarone by forming strong interactions with ARG331 in FXR binding pocket. All of these efforts lead to the identification of compound 4, which exerts better activity on FXR and uric acid-lowering effect than benzbromarone.",

This review discusses advances in gout genetics and their potential clinical applications.\nRECENT FINDINGS: Genome-wide association studies have identified approximately 30 serum urate-associated loci, some of which represent targets for drug development in gout. Some genes implicated in initiating the inflammatory response to deposited crystals in gout flares have also been described. In addition, genetic studies have been used to understand the link between hyperuricaemia and other comorbidities, particularly cardiometabolic diseases. ABCG2 has been established as a key genetic determinant in the onset of gout, and plays a role in the progression and severity of disease. Recent pharmacogenetic studies have also demonstrated the association between ABCG2 and poor response to allopurinol, and the link between HLA-B58:01 genotype and adverse drug reactions to allopurinol.\nSUMMARY: Advances in gout genetics have provided important molecular insights into disease pathogenesis, better characterized the pharmacogenetics of allopurinol, and raised the possibility of using genetic testing to provide personalized treatment for patients. Prospective studies are now needed to clarify whether genetic testing in gout provides further benefit when added to established clinical management.",

In this review, we discuss recent advances in epidemiology and treatment strategies for gout.\nRECENT FINDINGS: Genetic factors and obesity are prominent contributors to hyperuricemia and gout, while dietary factors contribute to less variance in serum urate, though can still have some contribution to population attributable risk. A consensus statement by the Gout, Hyperuricemia and Crystal-Associated Disease Network outlined appropriate terminology regarding gout, which will aid in communication about various aspects of the disease. The 2020 American College of Rheumatology gout guideline offers comprehensive evidence-based recommendations for the management of hyperuricemia using urate-lowering therapy, prophylaxis when initiating urate-lowering therapy, treatment of gout flare and adjunctive management strategies. There is improved understanding of risk factors for allopurinol hypersensitivity syndrome and well tolerated use of allopurinol in chronic kidney disease. Trial data have provided new insights regarding cardiovascular risk with febuxostat. Several new drug therapies are being tested for both urate-lowering efficacy and gout flare management.\nSUMMARY: Although there have been significant advances in understanding of risk factors and treatment approaches, gout remains suboptimally managed.

Patients were then divided into treatment group and control group according to the random number table method. All the patients received low purine diet, renin-angiotensin-aldosterone system (RAAS) inhibitors, and adequate routine hypoglycemic treatment. Febuxostat was employed only in the treatment group. The levels of blood uric acid (sUA), serum creatinine (Scr), cystatin C (cys-c), eGFR, 24-hour urine protein quantification, albuminuria, and creatinine ratio (ACR) were evaluated in all patients before and after treatment at 4, 8, 12, and 24 week.\nRESULTS: No difference was found before treatment between the two groups. After treatment at 4, 8, 12, and 24 week, the levels of sUA, SCr, cys-c, and eGFR between the two groups were significant different (P<0.05).

We aimed to search for factors associated with poor control of serum uric acid (UA) levels in a large population of patients with gout receiving ULT.\nMETHODS: This cross-sectional study involved adults with gout in primary care who were receiving ULT. Demographics, gout history, comorbidities, lifestyle, clinical factors, concomitant treatments, and laboratory data were compared in well-controlled gout (serum UA ≤6.0 mg\/dl) versus poorly controlled gout (serum UA >6.0 mg\/dl) on univariate and multivariate analyses.\nRESULTS: Among the 1,995 patients receiving ULT, only 445 (22.3%) had reached the target of 6.0 mg\/dl serum UA. Such patients had a lower rate of gout flares within the previous year than patients without the target (mean ± SD 1.7 ± 1.4 versus 2.1 ± 1.4; P < 0.0001). The main factors associated with poor serum UA level control in multivariate analysis were low high-density lipoprotein cholesterol level (adjusted odds ratio [OR] 0.5 [95% confidence interval (95% CI) 0.26-0.96]; P = 0.04), high total cholesterol level (OR 1.83 [95% CI 1.29-2.60]; P = 0.0007), increased waist circumference (OR 1.55 [95% CI 1.11-2.13]; P = 0.008), and alcohol consumption (OR 1.52 [95% CI 1.15-2.00]; P = 0.003).\nCONCLUSION: Dyslipidemia, abdominal obesity, and alcohol consumption are the main factors associated with a poor response to ULT.

Propensity score (PS)-weighted Cox proportional hazards model was used to estimate hazard ratios (HRs) for CKD progression and improvement. A separate analysis was conducted to assess the HR for CKD progression and CKD recovery among those with worsening CKD.\nRESULTS: The incidence of CKD progression among allopurinol, febuxostat and uricosuric agent users were 1.98, 1.88 and 1.64 per 1000 person-days. Compared with allopurinol users, the PS-weighted HR (95% confidence intervals [CIs]) was 1.77 (0.85-1.76) for febuxostat users and 1.37 (0.71-1.37) for uricosuric agent users for CKD progression and 1.43 (1.26-1.62) for febuxostat users and 1.00 (0.88-1.14) for uricosuric agent users for CKD improvement. Compared to allopurinol users, the HRs for CKD progression were 1.14 (0.80-1.66) for febuxostat users and 0.92 (0.67-1.31) for uricosuric agent users.

Although only a minority of our population develops clinically relevant symptomatic hyperuricemia, there is growing evidence that elevated serum uric acid levels might be associated with elevated cardiovascular risk and cardiovascular disease progression. But it is not clear whether uric acid is just a biomarker or exerts detrimental effects itself. The xanthine oxidoreductase (XOR) is an essential enzyme for the generation of uric acid. A typical pharmacological therapy to reduce the uric acid amounts is inhibition of XOR. There is good evidence that inhibition of uric acid reduces cardiovascular events in patients. The question arises if XOR inhibition might be an attractive target to reduce cardiovascular events in patients with high or even normal uric acid levels.\nMETHOD: This review summarizes the available publications on the relationship between XOR and cardiovascular co-morbidities.\nRESULTS: The association of elevated serum uric acid level with oxidative damage in the vessel wall, inflammatory and proliferative vascular changes, hypertension and impaired kidney function are depicted. In addition, the therapeutics currently approved for the treatments of hyperuricemia are outlined and an overview regarding novel, currently researched XOR inhibitors is provided.\nCONCLUSION: Observational and small prospective studies already have given hints for positive cardiovascular effects of XOR inhibition. However, larger prospective studies investigating cardiovascular outcomes are awaited to validate the potential beneficial effect of XOR inhibition for reduction of the cardiovascular burden.",

        "Abstract":"BACKGROUND: Hyperuricemia and gout are associated with an increased risk of cardiovascular disease. Xanthine oxidase inhibitors, allopurinol and febuxostat, are the mainstay of urate-lowering treatment for gout and may have different effects on cardiovascular risk in patients with gout.\nMETHODS: Using US Medicare claims data (2008-2013), we conducted a cohort study for comparative cardiovascular safety of initiating febuxostat versus allopurinol among patients with gout ≥65 years of age. The primary outcome was a composite end point of hospitalization for myocardial infarction or stroke. Secondary outcomes were individual end points of hospitalization for myocardial infarction, stroke, coronary revascularization, new and recurrent heart failure, and all-cause mortality. We used propensity score matching with a ratio of 1:3 to control for confounding. We estimated incidence rates and hazard ratios for primary and secondary outcomes in the propensity score-matched cohorts of febuxostat and allopurinol initiators.\nRESULTS: We included 24 936 febuxostat initiators propensity score-matched to 74 808 allopurinol initiators. The median age was 76 years, 52% were male, and 12% had cardiovascular disease at baseline. The incidence rate per 100 person-years for the primary outcome was 3.43 in febuxostat and 3.36 in allopurinol initiators. The hazard ratio for the primary outcome was 1.01 (95% CI, 0.94-1.08) in the febuxostat group compared with the allopurinol group. Risk of secondary outcomes including all-cause mortality was similar in both groups, except for a modestly decreased risk of heart failure exacerbation (hazard ratio, 0.94; 95% CI, 0.91-0.99) in febuxostat initiators. The hazard ratio for all-cause mortality associated with long-term use of febuxostat (>3 years) was 1.25 (95% CI, 0.56-2.80) versus allopurinol. Subgroup and sensitivity analyses consistently showed similar cardiovascular risk in both groups.\nCONCLUSIONS: Among a cohort of 99 744 older Medicare patients with gout, overall there was no difference in the risk of myocardial infarction, stroke, new-onset heart failure, coronary revascularization, or all-cause mortality between patients initiating febuxostat compared with allopurinol. However, there seemed to be a trend toward an increased, albeit not statistically significant, risk for all-cause mortality in patients who used febuxostat for >3 years versus allopurinol for >3 years. The risk of heart failure exacerbation was slightly lower in febuxostat initiators.",

        "Abstract":"The present review explores the role of xanthine oxidoreductase (XOR) in the development and progression of chronic kidney disease (CKD). Human XOR is a multi-level regulated enzyme, which has many physiological functions, but that is also implicated in several pathological processes. The main XOR activities are the purine catabolism, which generates uric acid, and the regulation of cell redox state and cell signaling, through the production of reactive oxygen species. XOR dysregulation may lead to hyperuricemia and oxidative stress, which could have a pathogenic role in the initial phases of CKD, by promoting cell injury, hypertension, chronic inflammation and metabolic derangements. Hypertension is common in CKD patients and many mechanisms inducing it (upregulation of renin-angiotensin-aldosterone system, endothelial dysfunction and atherosclerosis) may be influenced by XOR products. High XOR activity and hyperuricemia are also risk factors for obesity, insulin resistance, type 2 diabetes and metabolic syndrome that are frequent CKD causes. Moreover, CKD is common in patients with gout, which is characterized by hyperuricemia, and in patients with cardiovascular diseases, which are associated with hypertension, endothelial dysfunction and atherosclerosis. Although hyperuricemia is undoubtedly related to CKD, controversial findings have been hitherto reported in patients treated with urate-lowering therapies.",

        "Abstract":"OBJECTIVES: Uric acid (UA) control may be insufficient in chronic kidney disease (CKD) patients in the current era. It is unclear, however, whether this is the result of environmental effects, patient anthropometrics or insufficient dosing of medical therapy (allopurinol).\nMETHODS: We have collected data on multiple clinical and laboratory parameters of 114 CKD clinic patients attending the nephrology clinic of the University of Mississippi Medical Center with an estimated glomerular filtration rate <45 mL · min · 1.73 m. We assessed the correlates of UA levels and the allopurinol doses along with achieved serum UA and urine pH.\nRESULTS: The cohort consisted of middle-aged to elderly patients with a mean (± standard deviation) age of 62.1 (11.6) years; 45.6% were female, 68.4% were African American and 47.4% had a history of gout. The mean UA level was 7.7 (2.49) mg\/dL (range 3.1-16), allopurinol dose was 192 (99) mg\/day (range 50-450) and estimated glomerular filtration rate was 23.8 (11.3) mL · min · 1.73 m. While the overall serum bicarbonate level was 25 (3.2) mEq\/L, urine pH was <6 in 60.5% of the cohort. Significant univariate correlates of the administered doses of allopurinol were weight ( 0.317,  = 0.001), body mass index (BMI;  0.313,  = 0.001), and female sex (0.198;  = 0.035). Achieved UA levels correlated directly with BMI ( 0.201,  = 0.036) but inversely with the allopurinol dose ( -0.196;  = 0.036). During logistic regression analysis with stepwise selection, only weight (β 0.313,  = 0.001) and sex (β -0.190,  = 0.039) proved to be predictive of the allopurinol dose; as for the achieved UA level, only BMI (β 0.271,  = 0.006) and the allopurinol dose (β -0.258;  = 0.009) had a significant effect.\nCONCLUSIONS: In patients with advanced CKD, conventional dosing recommendations for allopurinol are unlikely to suffice in reaching target serum UA goals. In our cohort, larger-than-usual allopurinol doses were well tolerated.",

        "Published":"2022-08-30",
        "Abstract":"BACKGROUND AND OBJECTIVE: Previously, we developed a pharmacokinetic-pharmacodynamic model of allopurinol, oxypurinol, and biomarkers, hypoxanthine, xanthine, and uric acid, in neonates with hypoxic-ischemic encephalopathy, in which high initial biomarker levels were observed suggesting an impact of hypoxia. However, the full pharmacodynamics could not be elucidated in our previous study. The current study included additional data from the ALBINO study (NCT03162653) placebo group, aiming to characterize the dynamics of hypoxanthine, xanthine, and uric acid in neonates with hypoxic-ischemic encephalopathy.\nMETHODS: Neonates from the ALBINO study who received allopurinol or placebo mannitol were included. An extended population pharmacokinetic-pharmacodynamic model was developed based on the mechanism of purine metabolism, where synthesis, salvage, and degradation via xanthine oxidoreductase pathways were described. The initial level of the biomarkers was a combination of endogenous turnover and high disease-related amounts. Model development was accomplished by nonlinear mixed-effects modeling (NONMEM, version 7.5).\nRESULTS: In total, 20 neonates treated with allopurinol and 17 neonates treated with mannitol were included in this analysis. Endogenous synthesis of the biomarkers reduced with 0.43% per hour because of precursor exhaustion. Hypoxanthine was readily salvaged or degraded to xanthine with rate constants of 0.5 1\/h (95% confidence interval 0.33-0.77) and 0.2 1\/h (95% confidence interval 0.09-0.31), respectively. A greater salvage was found in the allopurinol treatment group consistent with its mechanism of action. High hypoxia-induced initial levels of biomarkers were quantified, and were 1.2-fold to 2.9-fold higher in neonates with moderate-to-severe hypoxic-ischemic encephalopathy compared with those with mild hypoxic-ischemic encephalopathy. Half-maximal xanthine oxidoreductase inhibition was achieved with a combined allopurinol and oxypurinol concentration of 0.68 mg\/L (95% confidence interval 0.48-0.92), suggesting full xanthine oxidoreductase inhibition during the period studied.\nCONCLUSIONS: This extended pharmacokinetic-pharmacodynamic model provided an adequate description of the complex hypoxanthine, xanthine, and uric acid metabolism in neonates with hypoxic-ischemic encephalopathy, suggesting a positive allopurinol effect on these biomarkers. The impact of hypoxia on their dynamics was characterized, underlining higher hypoxia-related initial exposure with a more severe hypoxic-ischemic encephalopathy status.",

        "Abstract":"Xanthine oxidase (XO) is a versatile molybdoflavoprotein, widely distributed, occurring in milk, kidney, lung, heart, and vascular endothelium. Catalysis by XO to produce uric acid and reactive oxygen species leads to many diseases. Anti hyperuricemic therapy by xanthine oxidase inhibitors has been mainly employed for the treatment of gout. Area covered: This review covers the patent literature (2011-2015) and also presents the interesting strategies\/rational approaches employed for the design of xanthine oxidase inhibitors reported recently. Expert opinion: Recent literature indicates that various non purine scaffolds have been extensively investigated for xanthine oxidase inhibition. The significant potential endowed by heteroaryl based compounds, in particularly fused heterocycles clearly highlights their clinical promise and the need for detailed investigation. Studies by various research groups have also revealed that the flavone framework is open for isosteric replacements and structural modifications for yielding potent non purine xanthine oxidase inhibitors. In addition, various plant extracts recently reported to possess significant xanthine oxidase inhibitory potential presents enough promise to initiate a screening program for the identification of other plant extracts and phytoconstituents possessing inhibitory potential towards the enzyme.",

        "Abstract":"BACKGROUND: Hyperuricemia is associated with the progression of chronic kidney disease (CKD), but it is not known whether the relationship is causal. We examined the association of hyperuricemia and uric acid lowering therapy (UALT) with progression of CKD in patients with CKD 3 and 4 in the Cleveland Clinic CKD registry.\nMETHODS: We included 1,676 patients with CKD stages 3 and 4 from Ohio, who had measured their uric acid (UA) levels a year prior to the recording of the second eGFR <60 mL\/min\/1.73 m2, and follow-up eGFR, between 2005 and 2009. Our primary composite outcome included a 50% drop in eGFR or progression to ESRD. Secondary outcomes included the rate of decline in eGFR, all-cause mortality, progression to ESRD, and a composite measure of progression to ESRD or death. We assessed the association between UA, UALT, and outcomes using Cox models and competing risks regression models.\nRESULTS: In multivariable models, higher UA was associated with the composite endpoint, but it reached statistical significance only in the 4th quartile (≥8.9 mg\/dL). Receipt of UALT was significantly associated with increased risk of the composite outcome. Neither UA nor UALT (considered a time-dependent covariate) was significantly associated with mortality. The inference was similar for UA as high vs. low, quartiles, or continuous. Similarly, neither high UA nor UALT were significantly associated with ESRD, the composite of ESRD and mortality, or eGFR decline.\nCONCLUSIONS: Hyperuricemia is associated with increased risk of progression to ESRD in patients with CKD stages 3 and 4, but UALT does not ameliorate the risk, suggesting that the relationship is not causal.",

        "Abstract":"BACKGROUND: Hyperuricemia is highly prevalent in chronic kidney disease (CKD) patients, but the evidence for a relationship between uric acid (UA) and clinical outcomes in CKD patients is limited and inconsistent. We hypothesized that UA has a different impact on clinical outcomes according to the underlying disease causing CKD.\nMETHODS: This study prospectively investigated the associations between UA and renal and non-renal outcomes according to the underlying disease causing CKD in 2,797 Japanese patients under the care of nephrologists. The patients were categorized into four groups: primary renal disease (n = 1306), hypertensive nephropathy (n = 467), diabetic nephropathy (n = 275), and other nephropathy (n = 749). The renal outcome was defined as end-stage renal disease (ESRD), and the non-renal outcome was defined as a composite endpoint of cardiovascular events (CVEs) and all-cause mortality.\nRESULTS: During a median 4.8-year follow-up, 359 (12.8%) patients reached the renal outcome, and 260 (9.3%) reached the non-renal outcome. In the all-patient analysis, hyperuricemia was not associated with the risks for renal and non-renal outcomes, but in primary renal disease (PRD) and hypertensive renal disease (HTN) patients, hyperuricemia was significantly associated with non-renal outcomes. Per 1 mg\/dl higher UA level, multivariable adjusted hazard ratio was 1.248 (95% CI: 1.003 to 1.553) for PRD, and 1.250 (1.035 to 1.510) for HTN. Allopurinol did not reduce the risks for renal and non-renal outcomes, both in all patients and in the subgroup analysis.\nCONCLUSIONS: The effect of hyperuricemia on clinical outcomes in CKD patients varies according to the underlying disease causing CKD. Hyperuricemia is an independent risk factor for non-renal outcomes in primary renal disease and hypertensive renal disease patients. Allopurinol did not decrease the risks for renal and non-renal outcomes.",

        "Published":null,
        "Abstract":"Gout is common in the elderly, affecting an estimated 4.7 million people aged > 60 years in the USA alone. The incidence and prevalence of gout increases, and male predisposition to gout reduces, with increasing age. The elderly have more comorbidities, and gout manifests differently, with more frequent involvement of knees, ankles, and wrists at disease onset, systemic upset, and tophi. Comorbidities and polypharmacy make the management of gout flares challenging in this population. Intra-articular corticosteroid injection remains the treatment of choice for accessible joints, oral prednisolone is preferred over low-dose colchicine, and non-steroidal anti-inflammatory drugs (NSAIDs) are best avoided. Xanthine oxidase inhibitors (XOI) remain the first-line treatment for hyperuricemia in the elderly. Arhalofenate, an emerging uricosuric anti-inflammatory drug, prevents gout flares while reducing serum urate. It may be particularly relevant in the treatment of gout in the elderly as they are unable to tolerate long-term colchicine for flare prophylaxis and frequently have contraindications to corticosteroids and NSAIDs. However, given its modest urate-lowering effect, it can only be used in combination with an XOI, and the safety and efficacy of this drug has not been examined in the elderly or in those with chronic kidney disease. Diuretics and beta-blockers should be discontinued where feasible, whereas low-dose aspirin can be continued if otherwise indicated.",

Gout treatment includes rapid initiation of anti-inflammatory medications for acute attacks and chronically treating with urate lowering drugs as well as chronic anti-inflammatory prophylaxis.

Expert opinion: Gout is a curable disease with appropriate treatment. The advent of new therapies provides encouraging opportunities to improve gout management. However, clinicians should be aware of some of the safety concerns of medications used to treat acute and chronic gout. When prescribing medications for gout one has to be mindful of the presence of comorbidities commonly affecting gout patients that may affect drug safety and efficacy, especially in the elderly and in patients treated with multiple drugs. The benefits of gout drugs, usually, outweigh their safety concerns. Studies are needed in gout patients with chronic kidney disease and\/or cardiovascular disease, so that escalation of dosing \/combination of anti-inflammatory drugs needed to suppress gouty inflammation as well as escalation of dosing\/combination of urate lowering drugs needed to achieve target serum urate level will lead to better understanding of gout treatment safety issues.",

We evaluated the long-term effect of febuxostat, a non-purine selective xanthine oxidase inhibitor, on endothelial function in patients with asymptomatic hyperuricemia.\nMETHODS: In the PRIZE study, patients with hyperuricemia were randomly assigned to either add-on febuxostat treatment (febuxostat group) or non-pharmacologic hyperuricemia treatment (control group). Among the 514 participants, endothelial function was assessed in 41 patients in the febuxostat group and 38 patients in the control group by flow-mediated vasodilation (FMD) of the brachial artery at the beginning of the study and after 12 and\/or 24 months of treatment (63 men; median age, 68.0 years).\nRESULTS: The least squares mean concentration of serum uric acid was significantly lower in the febuxostat group than in the control group at 6 months (mean between-group difference [febuxostat group - control group], -2.09 mg\/dL [95% confidence interval (CI), -2.520 to -1.659];  < 0.001), 12 months (mean between-group difference, -2.28 mg\/dL [95% CI, -2.709 to -1.842];  < 0.001), and 24 months (mean between-group difference, -2.61 mg\/dL [95% CI, -3.059 to -2.169];  < 0.001).
