        "Abstract":"BACKGROUND AND AIMS: Catheter-related bladder discomfort (CRBD) causes significant distress to the patient and requires great attention to analgesia and increases morbidity in the postoperative period. This study evaluated the efficacy of intramuscular dexmedetomidine in alleviating CRBD following percutaneous nephrolithotomy (PCNL) and postoperative inflammatory response.\nMATERIAL AND METHODS: A prospective randomized double-blind study was conducted in a tertiary care hospital from December 2019- March 2020. Sixty seven of ASA I and II patients scheduled for elective PCNL were randomized and group I received 1 μg\/kg dexmedetomidine intramuscularly and group II normal saline as control 30 minutes before induction of anesthesia. Standard anesthesia protocol was followed and patients were catheterized with 16 Fr Foleys after induction of anesthesia. Rescue analgesia was paracetamol if the score was moderate. Postoperatively CRBD score and inflammatory markers; total white cell count, erythrocyte sedimentation rate and temperature were noted for 3 days.\nRESULTS: There was a significant low CRBD score in group I. Ramsay sedation score was 2 in group I with p 0.00 and rescue analgesia required was very low with p 0.00. Statistical Package for social Sciences software version 20 was used for analysis. Student ttest, analysis of variance, and Chisquare test were applied for quantitative and qualitative analysis respectively.\nCONCLUSION: Single dose intramuscular dexmedetomidine is effective, simple and safe in preventing the CRBD and the inflammatory response remained uninfluenced except ESR, the reason remains largely unknown.",

        "Published":"2022-08-25",
        "Abstract":"BACKGROUND: Patients with diabetes mellitus (DM) are at a higher risk of ischemic events compared with patients without DM. Percutaneous coronary intervention (PCI) with the Resolute Onyx zotarolimus-eluting stent (ZES) followed by 1-month dual antiplatelet therapy (DAPT) is safe and effective in patients with high bleeding risk. However, outcomes in patients with DM are not fully understood.\nMETHODS: Onyx ONE Clear was a prospective, multicenter study that included patients receiving the Resolute Onyx ZES during PCI and 1-month DAPT. The primary end point was a composite of cardiac death (CD) or myocardial infarction from 1 month to 12 months.\nRESULTS: Among the Onyx ONE Clear population (N = 1506), 39% had DM. Patients with DM had a higher incidence of hypertension, hyperlipidemia, and previous PCI and a higher body mass index than patients without DM. Patients with diabetes were also younger, more likely to be anemic, and experience renal failure. After adjusting for baseline differences between the groups, the Kaplan-Meier rates of CD or myocardial infarction (9.3% vs 6.1%;  = .122, unadjusted  = .010) and target lesion failure (10.2% vs 7.7%;  = .294, unadjusted  = .056) between 1 month and 12 months were not significantly different in patients with and without DM. The rates of target lesion revascularization were also similar in both groups, and stent thrombosis was very low and comparable in both arms after adjusting for baseline differences. Non-CD and bleeding were more frequent in patients with DM.\nCONCLUSIONS: Patients with diabetes treated with the Resolute Onyx ZES followed by 1-month DAPT had favorable 12-month ischemic outcomes after accounting for baseline differences between patients with and without DM, supporting the safety and efficacy of the treatment in selected patients with DM at high bleeding risk.",

        "Abstract":"BACKGROUND: Heart failure (HF) is a growing public health problem and ischemic heart disease is an important risk factor. Understanding the epidemiology of HF in patients with atherosclerosis may help identify subgroups at greater risk who have the potential to derive greater benefit from preventive strategies.\nMETHODS AND RESULTS: The TRA 2°P-TIMI 50 trial randomized 26,449 patients with stable atherosclerosis to the antiplatelet agent vorapaxar versus placebo. Hospitalization for HF (HHF) endpoints were adjudicated from serious adverse events by blinded structured review using established definitions. HHF incidence was estimated using Kaplan-Meier analysis. Independent predictors of HHF risk were identified using multivariable logistic regression. The effect of vorapaxar on HHF risk was explored using Cox regression. The estimated incidence of HHF at 3 years was 1.6%. Independent predictors of HHF included prior HF (adjusted odds ratio [adj-OR]: 8.31; 95% confidence interval [CI]: 6.56-10.54), age (adj-OR [per 10 years]: 1.67; 95% CI: 1.47-1.89), type 2 diabetes mellitus (T2DM; adj-OR: 2.55; 95% CI: 2.01-3.24), polyvascular disease (two-territory disease, adj-OR: 1.89; 95% CI: 1.46-2.44; three-territory disease, adj-OR: 2.68; 95% CI: 1.94-3.70), chronic kidney disease (CKD; adj-OR: 1.65; 95% CI: 1.30-2.11), body mass index (BMI; adj-OR [per 5 kg\/m ]: 1.15; 95% CI: 1.03-1.27), prior myocardial infarction (MI) (adj-OR: 1.35; 95% CI: 1.03-1.78), and hypertension (adj-OR: 1.44; 95% CI: 1.02-2.04). Patients who experienced HHF during follow-up had higher rates of subsequent rehospitalization and death.

        "Published":"2022-07-06",
        "Abstract":"OBJECTIVE: Patients diagnosed with Kawasaki disease (KD) are at a high risk of developing coronary artery aneurysms. Intravenous immune globulin (IVIG) given in combination with aspirin is the standard of treatment for the prevention of coronary aneurysm. IVIG is recommended to be administered as a dose of 2 g\/kg infused during 10 to 12 hours for the prevention of coronary aneurysms in KD; however, this does not always occur in practice. We aimed to investigate if an infusion time of <10 hours is associated with more coronary artery aneurysms than the recommended infusion time of 10 to 12 hours.\nMETHODS: Patients with a diagnosis of and treated for KD with IVIG at the University of Chicago Medicine Comer Children's Hospital were identified by drug use reports that included patients who received IVIG between September 2008 and August 2018. Data were collected though chart review and patients were divided into 2 groups based on duration of infusion (<10 hours and 10-12 hours). The primary outcome was the incidence of coronary artery aneurysm. The secondary outcome was the time to defervescence. The safety outcome was the development of renal dysfunction.\nRESULTS: A total of 70 patients were screened and 44 were included in the analysis. Coronary aneurysm occurred in 2 of 33 patients (6.0%) in the <10-hour group and no patients in the 10- to 12-hour group (p = 0.558). The median time to defervescence was 0.5 hours in the <10-hour group and 0.95 hours in the 10- to 12-hour group (p = 0.166). The incidence of acute kidney injury was 6% (2 of 33 patients) in the 10-hour group and 9.1% (1 of 11 patients) in the 10- to 12-hour group (p = 0.588).\nCONCLUSIONS: All incidences of coronary artery aneurysm occurred in the patients who received IVIG with an infusion time of <10 hours. The incidence of acute kidney injury was numerically higher in the 10- to 12-hour group. Based on the recommendations in the American Heart Association KD guideline, our internal hospital policy, and our results, we recommend the infusion of IVIG be administered at a rate of 10 to 12 hours.",

        "Abstract":"This article summarizes the top 20 research studies of 2021 identified as POEMs (patient-oriented evidence that matters) that did not address the COVID-19 pandemic. Sodium-glucose cotransporter-2 inhibitors and glucagon-like peptide-1 receptor agonists prevent adverse cardiovascular and renal outcomes in patients with type 2 diabetes mellitus and also reduce all-cause and cardiovascular mortality. Most older adults (mean age, 75 years) with prediabetes do not progress to diabetes. Among patients in this age group with type 2 diabetes treated with medication, an A1C level of less than 7% is associated with increased risk of hospitalization for hypoglycemia, especially when using a sulfonylurea or insulin. For patients with chronic low back pain, exercise, nonsteroidal anti-inflammatory drugs, duloxetine, and opioids were shown to be more effective than control in achieving a 30% reduction in pain, but self-discontinuation of duloxetine and opioids was common. There is no clinically important difference between muscle relaxants and placebo in the treatment of nonspecific low back pain. In patients with chronic pain, low- to moderate-quality evidence supports exercise, yoga, massage, and mindfulness-based stress reduction. For acute musculoskeletal pain, acetaminophen, 1,000 mg, plus ibuprofen, 400 mg, without an opioid is a good option. Regarding screening for colorectal cancer, trial evidence supports performing fecal immunochemical testing every other year. For chronic constipation, evidence supports polyethylene glycol, senna, fiber supplements, magnesium-based products, and fruit-based products. The following abdominal symptoms carry a greater than 3% risk of cancer or inflammatory bowel disease: dysphagia or change in bowel habits in men; rectal bleeding in women; and abdominal pain, change in bowel habits, or dyspepsia in men and women older than 60 years. For secondary prevention in those with established arteriosclerotic cardiovascular disease, 81 mg of aspirin daily appears to be effective. The Framingham Risk Score and the Pooled Cohort Equations both overestimate the risk of cardiovascular events. Over 12 years, no association between egg consumption and cardiovascular events was demonstrated. Gabapentin, pregabalin, duloxetine, and venlafaxine provide clinically meaningful improvements in chronic neuropathic pain. In patients with moderate to severe depression, initial titration above the minimum starting dose of antidepressants in the first eight weeks of treatment is not more likely to increase response. In adults with iron deficiency anemia, adding vitamin C to oral iron has no effect. In children with pharyngitis, rhinosinusitis, acute bronchitis, or acute otitis media, providing education combined with a take-and-hold antibiotic prescription results in 1 in 4 of those children eventually taking an antibiotic.",

        "Abstract":"OBJECTIVE: To assess whether estimated glomerular filtration rate (eGFR) independently predicts adverse outcomes after AUS surgery.\nMETHODS: Using a large national database, we identified adult males who underwent AUS surgery between 2005-2019. To calculate eGFR (ml\/min\/1.73 m), the Cockroft-Gault equation was utilized. Patients were classified into five different groups: 0-29 (advanced chronic kidney disease [CKD]), 30-59 (Stage III CKD), 60-89 (Stage II CKD), 90-119 (normal), and >120 (hyperfiltration). We investigated 30-day outcomes including any complication, readmission, reoperation, major and minor complications, extended length of stay, and non-home discharge. Multivariable logistic regression analysis (MLRA) was performed to assess eGFR categories as independent predictors for each outcome.\nRESULTS: A total of 1,910 cases met inclusion criteria. Patients with advanced CKD had a higher frailty burden (5-item modified frailty index ≥2: 39.1% vs. 22.2%), higher American Society of Anesthesiologists score (ASA III or IV: 95.7% vs. 53.5%), and lower BMI (median kg\/m²: 29.3 vs. 30.9) compared to patients with normal eGFR. Likewise, patients with advanced CKD had higher rates of any complication, readmission, reoperation, extended length of stay, non-home discharge, as well as major and minor complications, compared to patients with normal eGFR. On MLRA, advanced CKD (0-29) was independently associated with reoperation (OR 5.14; 95% CI 1.06 - 20.84; p = 0.043).\nCONCLUSIONS: Patients with advanced CKD had a higher likelihood of reoperation when compared to patients with normal eGFR. Patients with advanced CKD should be counseled prior to AUS surgery due to a potential higher risk of 30-day reoperation.",

        "Abstract":"OBJECTIVE: It is still a matter of debate whether low-dose acetylsalicylic acid (LDASA) should be prescribed to all patients with SLE during pregnancy. This study aimed at investigating the impact of LDASA on pregnancy outcomes in patients with SLE without history of renal involvement and without antiphospholipid antibodies (aPL).\nMETHODS: This is a retrospective analysis of prospectively monitored pregnancies at seven rheumatology centres. Previous\/current renal involvement and aPL positivity were the exclusion criteria. Adverse pregnancy outcome (APO) is the composite outcome of the study and included proteinuric pre-eclampsia, preterm delivery <37 weeks, small-for-gestational age infant, low birth weight <2500 g, intrauterine growth restriction and intrauterine fetal death after 12 weeks of gestation of a morphologically normal fetus.\nRESULTS: 216 pregnancies in 187 patients were included; 82 pregnancies (38.0%) were exposed to LDASA treatment. No differences in terms of age at conception, disease duration, clinical manifestations, comorbidities and disease flare during pregnancy were observed between patients taking LDASA and those who did not take LDASA during pregnancy. APO was observed in 65 cases (30.1%), including 13 cases (6.1%) of pre-eclampsia. The incidence of all complications was similar in the two groups. However, it is interesting to note that pre-eclampsia had lower frequency in patients taking LDASA versus those not taking LDASA (2.4% vs 8.3%, p=0.14).\nCONCLUSIONS: In pregnant patients with SLE without renal involvement and were aPL-negative, there is a low risk of severe obstetric complications, such as early pre-eclampsia. LDASA treatment does not provide a statistically significant advantage over these complications. However, a careful individual risk-benefit balance is warranted.",

Composite AVF failure (thrombosis, abandonment, cannulation failure) and its individual components were compared between ANZ ( = 209) and Malaysian ( = 144) participants using logistic regression adjusted for patient- and potentially modifiable clinical factors.\nRESULTS: Participants' mean age was 55 ± 14.3 years and 64% were male. Compared with ANZ participants, Malaysian participants were younger with lower body mass index, higher prevalence of diabetes mellitus and lower prevalence of cardiovascular disease. AVF failure was less frequent in the Malaysian cohort (38% vs 54%; adjusted odds ratio (OR) 0.53, 95% confidence interval (CI) 0.31-0.93). This difference was driven by lower odds of cannulation failure (29% vs 47%, OR 0.45, 95% CI 0.25-0.80), while the odds of AVF thrombosis (17% vs 20%, OR 1.24, 95% CI 0.62-2.48) and abandonment (25% vs 23%, OR 1.17, 95% CI 0.62-2.16) were similar.\nCONCLUSIONS: The risk of AVF failure was significantly lower in Malaysia compared to ANZ and driven by a lower risk of cannulation failure.

        "Abstract":"BACKGROUND: Preeclampsia is a hypertensive disease unique to pregnancy and has a significant impact on maternal and neonatal morbidity and mortality. Daily aspirin has been demonstrated to reduce the risk of preeclampsia. The American College of Obstetricians and Gynecologists recommends daily low-dose aspirin, ideally before 16 weeks' gestation, in at-risk patients for preeclampsia risk reduction. This study examined whether patients at-risk for preeclampsia by the American College of Obstetricians and Gynecologists criteria recalled aspirin recommendation and factors associated with treatment adherence.\nOBJECTIVE: This study examined whether patients at-risk for preeclampsia by the American College of Obstetricians and Gynecologists criteria recalled aspirin recommendation and factors associated with treatment adherence.\nSTUDY DESIGN: This study used an anonymous written survey. Pregnant patients were asked to record self-reported risk factors and to recall recommendation to take aspirin for preeclampsia prophylaxis. Participants were then determined to be high-, moderate-, or low-risk on the basis of the American College of Obstetricians and Gynecologists guidelines. Self-reported adherence to recommendations and factors contributing to the patients' decisions to take or decline aspirin were assessed. Secondary outcomes included demographic characteristics of adherent patients and patients who did not recall aspirin recommendation.\nRESULTS: A total of 544 surveys were distributed and 500 were returned (91.9% response rate). Of the 104 high-risk pregnancies identified, aspirin was recommended in 60 (57.7%; 95% confidence interval, 0.48-0.67). Of the 269 patients with 2 or more moderate-risk factors, aspirin was recommended for 13 (4.8%; 95% confidence interval, 0.03-0.08). Among the participants who recalled aspirin recommendation, adherence was similar between high-risk (81.7%) and moderate-risk (76.9%) groups (P=.69). Patients with chronic hypertension, a history of preeclampsia or gestational hypertension in a previous pregnancy, and pregestational diabetes mellitus were most likely to report receiving aspirin recommendation (78.8%, 76.5%, 63.8%, and 53.3%, respectively). No high-risk factor was associated with a decreased likelihood of adherence. Nonadherent patients rarely discussed their decision with their medical provider (5.9%). In the 42.3% of high-risk participants who did not recall aspirin recommendation, autoimmune disease, multiple gestation, and kidney disease were the most prevalent risk factors (42.9%, 35.7%, and 25.0%, respectively).\nCONCLUSION: In the population studied, many at-risk patients, as defined by the American College of Obstetricians and Gynecologists criteria, did not recall recommendations to take aspirin for preeclampsia prophylaxis. This raises concerns for absent or ineffective counseling. Of the patients who recalled aspirin recommendation, most reported adherence, and a history of hypertensive disorders or preeclampsia, autoimmune disease, and pregestational diabetes mellitus were most often associated with adherence. There was no single factor most strongly associated with intentional nonadherence.",

        "Published":"2022-04-29",
        "Abstract":"BACKGROUND: Acute interstitial nephritis (AIN) is an important cause of kidney injury accounting for up to 27% of unexplained renal impairment. In up to 70% of cases, drugs, including aminosalicylates, are reported as the underlying cause. Following two recent paediatric cases of suspected mesalazine induced AIN within our own department, we performed a systematic review of the literature to address the following question: In patients with inflammatory bowel disease (IBD), is interstitial nephritis associated with 5-aminosalicylate (5-ASA) treatment? Our primary objective was to identify the number of cases reported in the literature of biopsy-proven 5-ASA induced interstitial nephritis, in children and adults with IBD. We also aimed to identify which variables influence the onset, severity and recovery of 5-ASA interstitial nephritis.\nMETHODS: Embase and PubMed databases were searched from inception to 07\/10\/20. Search terms had three main themes: \"inflammatory bowel disease\", \"interstitial nephritis\" and \"aminosalicylates\". Studies were included if they reported an outcome of AIN, confirmed on biopsy, suspected to be secondary to a 5-ASA drug in those with IBD. A narrative synthesis was performed.\nRESULTS: Forty-one case reports were identified. Mesalazine was the most frequently reported aminosalicylate associated with AIN (95%). The median duration of treatment before AIN was diagnosed was 2.3 years (Interquartile Range (IQR) 12-48 months). The median rise in creatinine was 3.3 times the baseline measurement (IQR 2.5-5.5). Aminosalicylate withdrawal and steroids were the most frequently used treatments. Despite treatment, 15% of patients developed end-stage renal failure.\nCONCLUSIONS: AIN is a serious adverse drug reaction associated with aminosalicylates, with mesalazine accounting for most reports. The current guidance of annual monitoring of renal function may not be sufficient to identify cases early. Given the severity of AIN and reports in the literature that early treatment with steroids may be beneficial, we would recommend at least 6 monthly monitoring of renal function.

        "Published":"2022-04-21",
        "Abstract":"BACKGROUND: Chronic kidney disease (CKD) is a very common long-term condition and powerful risk factor for cardiovascular disease (CVD). Low-dose aspirin is of proven benefit in the secondary prevention of myocardial infarction (MI) and stroke in people with pre-existing CVD. However, in people without CVD, the rates of MI and stroke are much lower, and the benefits of aspirin in the primary prevention of CVD are largely balanced by an increased risk of bleeding. People with CKD are at greatly increased risk of CVD and so the absolute benefits of aspirin are likely to be greater than in lower-risk groups, even if the relative benefits are the same. Post hoc evidence suggests the relative benefits may be greater in the CKD population but the risk of bleeding may also be higher. A definitive study of aspirin for primary prevention in this high-risk group, recommended by the National Institute for Health and Care Excellence (NICE) in 2014, has never been conducted. The question has global significance given the rising burden of CKD worldwide and the low cost of aspirin.\nMETHODS: ATTACK is a pragmatic multicentre, prospective, randomised, open-label, blinded endpoint adjudication superiority trial of aspirin 75 mg daily vs. standard care for the primary prevention of CVD in 25,210 people aged 18 years and over with CKD recruited from UK Primary Care. Participants aged 18 years and over with CKD (GFR category G1-G4) will be identified in Primary Care and followed up using routinely collected data and annual questionnaires for an average of 5 years. The primary outcome is the time to first major vascular event (composite of non-fatal MI, non-fatal stroke and cardiovascular death [excluding confirmed intracranial haemorrhage and other fatal cardiovascular haemorrhage]). Deaths from other causes (including fatal bleeding) will be treated as competing events. The study will continue until 1827 major vascular events have occurred. The principal safety outcome is major intracranial and extracranial bleeding; this is hypothesised to be increased in those randomised to take aspirin. The key consideration is then whether and to what extent the benefits of aspirin from the expected reduction in CVD events exceed the risks of major bleeding.\nDISCUSSION: This will be the first definitive trial of aspirin for primary CVD prevention in CKD patients. The research will be of great interest to clinicians, guideline groups and policy-makers, in the UK and globally, particularly given the high and rising prevalence of CKD that is driven by population ageing and epidemics of obesity and diabetes.

        "Abstract":"INTRODUCTION: Modified fluid gelatin 4% is approved for use in children, but there is still a surprising lack of clinical studies including large numbers of pediatric patients. Therefore, we performed a European prospective noninterventional multicenter study to evaluate the use of a modified fluid gelatin 4% in saline (sal-GEL) or an acetate-containing balanced electrolyte solution (bal-GEL) in children undergoing major pediatric surgery.\nAIMS: The primary aim was to assess the indications and dosing of modified fluid gelatin, and the secondary aim was to assess the safety and efficacy, focusing, in particular, on routinely collected clinical parameters.\nMETHODS: Children aged up to 12 years with ASA risk scores of I-III receiving sal-GEL or bal-GEL were followed perioperatively. Demographic data, surgical procedures performed, anesthesia, hemodynamic and laboratory data, adverse events, and adverse drug reactions were documented using a standardized case report form.\nRESULTS: 601 children that were investigated at 13 European pediatric centers from May 2015 to March 2020 (sal-GEL 20.1%, bal-GEL 79.9%; mean age 29.1 ± 38.6 (range 0-144) months; body weight 12.1 ± 10.5 (1.4-70) kg) were included in the analysis. The most frequent indications for GEL infusion were hemodynamic instability without bleeding (76.0%), crystalloids alone not being sufficient for hemodynamic stabilization (55.7%), replacement of preoperative deficit (26.0%), and significant bleeding (13.0%). Mean infused GEL volume was 13.0 ± 5.3 (2.4-37.5) ml kg . The total dose was affected by age, with higher doses in younger patients. After gelatin infusion, mean arterial pressure increased (mean change 8.5 ± 7.3 [95% CI: 8 to 9.1] mmHg), and the hemoglobin concentrations decreased significantly (mean change -1.1 ± 1.8 [95% CI: -1.2 to -0.9] g·dL ). Acid-base parameters were more stable with bal-GEL. No serious adverse drug reactions directly related to gelatin (i.e., anaphylactoid reaction, clotting disorders, and renal failure) were observed.\nCONCLUSION: Moderate doses up to 20 ml kg of modified fluid gelatin were infused most frequently to improve hemodynamic stability in children undergoing major pediatric surgery. The acid-base balance was more stable when gelatin in a balanced electrolyte solution was used instead of saline. No serious adverse drug reactions associated with gelatin were observed.",

        "Abstract":"BACKGROUND: Dual antiplatelet therapy (DAPT) prevents ischemic events in patients with acute coronary syndrome (ACS), but is associated with increased risk of bleeding events. Symmetric dimethylarginine (SDMA) is one of nitric oxide (NO)-related pathway metabolites and stands as a promising biomarker of early chronic kidney disease (CKD) and cardiovascular diseases (CVDs).\nOBJECTIVES: Our study evaluated the role of SDMA in predicting bleeding events in patients after ACS treated with DAPT.\nMETHODS: We compared plasma concentrations of NO-related pathway metabolites in patients with ACS (n = 291) and investigated the prognostic value of SDMA as a bleeding predictor during 1-year follow-up. We measured the metabolites concentration using ultra performance liquid chromatography. Platelet reactivity was determined using impedance aggregometry.\nRESULTS: Patients with the highest quartile (4th) of SDMA concentration had significantly lower platelet aggregation compared to those in the 1st-3rd quartiles of SDMA, based on ADP + PGE1-, AA-, and ADP-induced platelet reactivity tests (p = 0.0004, p = 0.002, p = 0.014, respectively). Patients with major or minor bleeding events had significantly higher concentrations of SDMA as compared to those without bleeding events or to those with minimal bleeding events (p = 0.019, p = 0.019, respectively).\nCONCLUSION: Higher SDMA concentration is associated with lower platelet reactivity and is associated with major and minor bleeding events in patients with ACS on DAPT. Therefore, SDMA stands as a potential biomarker for individualization of duration and potency of antiplatelet therapies in the ACS population at high risk of bleeding complications.",

        "Abstract":"BACKGROUND: With an increasing prevalence in industrialized countries, lithiasis represents a public health problem with significant economic cost. Ureteroscopy is nowadays the main treatment for kidney and ureteral stones with increasingly broad indications. While this treatment is relatively safe and effective, the complications can be severe.\nAIM: The aim of this study was to investigate the preoperative risk factors of complication in the 30 days following a rigid or flexible ureteroscopy in a large cohort of patients.\nMETHODS: A retrospective multicenter study was conducted in 5 French centers between January 1st 2017 and 31st December 2018. All flexible and rigid ureteroscopies performed were included. All preoperative and per operative data were collected in an electronic database. Outcomes and complications within 30 days of the procedure were also collected. Univariate and multivariable analyses evaluated for potential predictors of postoperative complications.\nRESULTS: 1124 procedures were included. According to the occurrence of a postoperative complication, patients were divided into two groups, 109 in the group with complications. The majority of complications were minor, with only 13.7% classified as Clavien 3-4. In univariate analysis, ASA score>2 (odd ratio, OR=1.68, P=0.04), WHO performance status≥1 (OR=1.50, P=0.04) and neurologic disease (OR=2.78, P=0.005) were predictors of postoperative complications. In multivariable analysis, Charlson's score (OR=0.79, P=0.01) and ASA score>2 (OR=1.48, P=0.03) were independents risk factors of postoperative complication. Concerning major complications, in univariate analysis, cardiovascular disease (OR=3.71, P=0.032) and BMI (OR=0.87, P=0.02) were the only predictors of major complications after ureteroscopy. Only BMI was found In multivariable analysis (OR=0.86, P=0.01) CONCLUSION: Baseline characteristics and comorbidities of the patients, especially neurological diseases, were the main risk factors for short-term complications after ureteroscopy. Ureteroscopy remains a relatively safe and effective procedure. However, we advise surgeons to take precautions with fragile patients with multiple comorbidities or neurological disease.",

        "Published":"2022-02-28",
        "Abstract":"BACKGROUND: Antiplatelet agents are widely used to prevent cardiovascular events. The risks and benefits of antiplatelet agents may be different in people with chronic kidney disease (CKD) for whom occlusive atherosclerotic events are less prevalent, and bleeding hazards might be increased. This is an update of a review first published in 2013.\nOBJECTIVES: To evaluate the benefits and harms of antiplatelet agents in people with any form of CKD, including those with CKD not receiving renal replacement therapy, patients receiving any form of dialysis, and kidney transplant recipients.\nSEARCH METHODS: We searched the Cochrane Kidney and Transplant Register of Studies up to 13 July 2021 through contact with the Information Specialist using search terms relevant to this review. Studies in the Register are identified through searches of CENTRAL, MEDLINE, and EMBASE, conference proceedings, the International Clinical Trials Register (ICTRP) Search Portal and ClinicalTrials.gov.\nSELECTION CRITERIA: We selected randomised controlled trials of any antiplatelet agents versus placebo or no treatment, or direct head-to-head antiplatelet agent studies in people with CKD. Studies were included if they enrolled participants with CKD, or included people in broader at-risk populations in which data for subgroups with CKD could be disaggregated.\nDATA COLLECTION AND ANALYSIS: Four authors independently extracted data from primary study reports and any available supplementary information for study population, interventions, outcomes, and risks of bias. Risk ratios (RR) and 95% confidence intervals (CI) were calculated from numbers of events and numbers of participants at risk which were extracted from each included study. The reported RRs were extracted where crude event rates were not provided. Data were pooled using the random-effects model. Confidence in the evidence was assessed using the Grading of Recommendations Assessment, Development and Evaluation (GRADE) approach.\nMAIN RESULTS: We included 113 studies, enrolling 51,959 participants; 90 studies (40,597 CKD participants) compared an antiplatelet agent with placebo or no treatment, and 29 studies (11,805 CKD participants) directly compared one antiplatelet agent with another. Fifty-six new studies were added to this 2021 update. Seven studies originally excluded from the 2013 review were included, although they had a follow-up lower than two months. Random sequence generation and allocation concealment were at low risk of bias in 16 and 22 studies, respectively. Sixty-four studies reported low-risk methods for blinding of participants and investigators; outcome assessment was blinded in 41 studies. Forty-one studies were at low risk of attrition bias, 50 studies were at low risk of selective reporting bias, and 57 studies were at low risk of other potential sources of bias. Compared to placebo or no treatment, antiplatelet agents probably reduces myocardial infarction (18 studies, 15,289 participants: RR 0.88, 95% CI 0.79 to 0.99, I² = 0%; moderate certainty). Antiplatelet agents has uncertain effects on fatal or nonfatal stroke (12 studies, 10.382 participants: RR 1.01, 95% CI 0.64 to 1.59, I² = 37%; very low certainty) and may have little or no effect on death from any cause (35 studies, 18,241 participants: RR 0.94, 95 % CI 0.84 to 1.06, I² = 14%; low certainty). Antiplatelet therapy probably increases major bleeding in people with CKD and those treated with haemodialysis (HD) (29 studies, 16,194 participants: RR 1.35, 95% CI 1.10 to 1.65, I² = 12%; moderate certainty). In addition, antiplatelet therapy may increase minor bleeding in people with CKD and those treated with HD (21 studies, 13,218 participants: RR 1.55, 95% CI 1.27 to 1.90, I² = 58%; low certainty). Antiplatelet treatment may reduce early dialysis vascular access thrombosis (8 studies, 1525 participants) RR 0.52, 95% CI 0.38 to 0.70; low certainty). Antiplatelet agents may reduce doubling of serum creatinine in CKD (3 studies, 217 participants: RR 0.39, 95% CI 0.17 to 0.86, I² = 8%; low certainty). The treatment effects of antiplatelet agents on stroke, cardiovascular death, kidney failure, kidney transplant graft loss, transplant rejection, creatinine clearance, proteinuria, dialysis access failure, loss of primary unassisted patency, failure to attain suitability for dialysis, need of intervention and cardiovascular hospitalisation were uncertain. Limited data were available for direct head-to-head comparisons of antiplatelet drugs, including prasugrel, ticagrelor, different doses of clopidogrel, abciximab, defibrotide, sarpogrelate and beraprost.\nAUTHORS' CONCLUSIONS: Antiplatelet agents probably reduced myocardial infarction and increased major bleeding, but do not appear to reduce all-cause and cardiovascular death among people with CKD and those treated with dialysis. The treatment effects of antiplatelet agents compared with each other are uncertain.",

The clinical data of 17 TA patients with pregnancy and finally terminated admitted to the First Affiliated Hospital of Zhengzhou University from January 2012 to December 2020 were collected and the maternal and infant outcomes were retrospectively analyzed.  Among the 24 pregnancies in 17 TA patients in our hispital, 11 patients in our hospital were primiparous (46%, 11\/24) and 13 patients were multiparous (54%, 13\/24); 4 cases of chronic hypertension before pregnancy (17%, 4\/24), and 20 cases of non-hypertension (83%, 20\/24) were abserved. Apart from the thoracoabdominal artery type, 15 cases (63%, 15\/24) of brachiocephalic type, 8 cases (33%, 8\/24) of extensive type, and 1 case of pulmonary artery type (4%, 1\/24) were included in TA classification; the renal artery was damaged in 7 cases (7\/8) of the extensive type. Among the 24 pregnancies of 17 TA patients, 8 cases of pregnancy complications occurred, including 4 cases (17%, 4\/24) of preeclampsia, one case of (4%, 1\/24) new-onset hypertension during pregnancy, exacerbation of existing hypertension, thrombocytopenia and ischemic stroke respectively; 3 cases of induced abortion, 1 case of induced labor, and 20 cases of final delivery were found. Of the 20 final deliveries, 3 cases (15%, 3\/20) were delivered through the vagina; 17 cases (85%, 17\/20) were delivered by cesarean section; 3 cases (15%, 3\/20) of fetal growth restriction and 6 cases of oligohydramnios (30%, 6\/20) were occurred. The median gestational age of pregnancy termination of 17 full-term neonates (85%, 17\/20) and 3 premature neonates (15%, 3\/20) was 38.4 weeks (range:29.6-40.9 weeks). All premature women were complicated with pre-eclampsia or severe pre-eclampsia, which lead to premature birth; the birth weight of the neonates was (2 791±783) g. Neonatal asphyxia occurred in 3 cases (15%, 3\/20), and 6 cases (30%, 6\/20) were admitted to the neonatal intensive care unit. None of the newborns died. The patients were followed up for 3 months to 7 years. Except for one case who underwent surgical treatment 3 years after delivery and died of intraoperative hemorrhage, the other 16 patients were in stable condition; all the newborns grew and developed well. The incidences of maternal and infant adverse events were higher in those with chronic hypertension, renal artery involvement, and no use of hormones and aspirin during pregnancy, but the differences were not statistically significant (all >0.05).  Pregnancy with TA has adverse effects on maternal and infant outcomes. To reduce the occurrence of maternal and child adverse events, the condition of TA patients should be fully assessed before pregnancy, multidisciplinary cooperation, regular treatment, strengthened monitoring of the condition, timely treatment of complications, selection of appropriate delivery methods after pregnancy, and vigilance of postpartum complications should be properly carried out.",

        "Abstract":"In this real-world, retrospective cohort study of 9753 patients in Japan prescribed dual antiplatelet therapy (DAPT) following percutaneous coronary intervention (PCI), we investigated DAPT duration and determined factors associated with early DAPT discontinuation and with event rates in patients who discontinued DAPT. The study period was April 1, 2012-March 31, 2018; endpoints comprised composite efficacy [death, myocardial infarction (MI), and stroke] and bleeding (intracranial, gastrointestinal, and requiring transfusion) endpoints. Overall, 68.8% of patients were continuing DAPT at 3 months post-PCI. Patients without major efficacy or safety events within 3 months after index PCI were included in a landmark analysis set (LAS; n = 7056), and categorized as DAPT ≥ 3 months (continuation) versus < 3 months (discontinuation). In the two LAS analysis groups, there was no difference in the composite bleeding endpoint (P = 0.067), although the incidence of the composite efficacy endpoint was higher in the discontinuation group (P < 0.001). In multivariate regression analysis, age ≥ 75 years, minor bleeding after PCI, history of cerebral infarction, history of cerebral or gastrointestinal bleeding, atrial fibrillation, dialysis, and anticoagulant use after PCI were associated with early DAPT discontinuation. Acute coronary syndrome, history of MI, kidney disorder, and anticoagulant use after PCI were associated with the composite efficacy endpoint in the discontinuation group. In conclusion, early DAPT discontinuation is more likely in patients at high bleeding risk, but may influence the occurrence of ischemic events in these patients. Determination of DAPT duration should take into account potential ischemic risk, even in patients at high bleeding risk.",

A subsequent kidney biopsy confirmed acute interstitial nephritis (AIN). She later developed uveitis and the final diagnosis was tubulointerstitial nephritis and uveitis (TINU) syndrome, possibly triggered by aspirin, requiring systemic and topical corticosteroid therapies. TINU syndrome should be considered in young patients with fever of unknown origin and a history of nonsteroidal anti-inflammatory drug use. This is the first reported case suggesting the usefulness of DW-MRI, which is safe for children without exposure to ionising radiation, in detecting early-stage AIN before apparent kidney impairment.",

This study examined the severity of AEs from a high-volume thoracic surgery center and its effect on the patient postoperative LOS and readmissions to hospital. This study includes patients who underwent an elective lung resection between September 2018 and January 2020. The AEs were grouped as no AEs, 1 or more minor AEs, and 1 or more major AEs. The effects of the AEs on patient LOS and readmissions were examined using a survival analysis and logistic regression, respectively, while adjusting for the other demographic or clinical variables.

        "Abstract":"BACKGROUND: Postoperative acute kidney injury (AKI) is a serious complication that is associated with prolonged hospital stay, high risk of short-term postsurgical mortality, need for dialysis, and possible progression to chronic kidney disease. To date, very little data exist on the risk of postoperative AKI among children undergoing noncardiac surgical procedures. We used data from a large multicenter cohort to determine the factors associated with AKI among children who underwent inpatient noncardiac surgical procedures and its impact on the postoperative course.\nMETHODS: We utilized the National Surgical Quality Improvement Program Pediatric participant user files to identify a cohort of children who underwent inpatient surgery between 2012 and 2018 (n = 257,439). We randomly divided the study population into a derivation cohort of 193,082 (75%) and a validation cohort of 64,357 (25%), and constructed a multivariable logistic regression model to identify independent risk factors for AKI. We defined AKI as the occurrence of either acute renal failure or progressive renal insufficiency within the 30 days after surgery.\nRESULTS: The overall rate of postoperative AKI was 0.10% (95% confidence interval [CI], 0.09-0.11). In a multivariable model, operating times longer than 140 minutes, preexisting hematologic disorder, and preoperative sepsis were the strongest independent predictors of AKI. Other independent risk factors for AKI were American Society of Anesthesiologists (ASA) physical status ≥III, preoperative inotropic support, gastrointestinal disease, ventilator dependency, and corticosteroid use. The 30-day mortality rate was 10.1% in children who developed AKI and 0.19% in their counterparts without AKI ( P < .001). Children who developed AKI were more likely to require an extended hospital stay (≥75th percentile of the study cohort) relative to their peers without AKI (77.4% vs 21.0%; P < .001).\nCONCLUSIONS: Independent preoperative risk factors for AKI in children undergoing inpatient noncardiac surgery were hematologic disorder, preoperative sepsis, ASA physical status ≥III, inotropic support, gastrointestinal disease, ventilator dependency, and steroid use. Children with AKI were 10 times more likely to die and nearly 3 times more likely to require an extended hospital stay, relative to their peers without AKI.",

        "Abstract":"Atherosclerotic vascular disease is a leading cause of death worldwide. Atherosclerotic stenosis of the internal carotid or intracranial arteries causes up to 15% of strokes. Peripheral artery disease affects up to one in five people in the United States who are 60 years and older and nearly one-half of those who are 85 years and older. Renal artery stenosis may affect up to 5% of people with isolated hypertension and up to 40% of people with other atherosclerotic diseases. All patients with atherosclerotic vascular disease should receive a comprehensive program of guideline-directed medical therapy, including structured physical activity and lifestyle modification, an antiplatelet agent, a statin, antihypertensive therapy, and smoking cessation counseling. The U.S. Preventive Services Task Force recommends one-time screening for abdominal aortic aneurysm with ultrasonography in men 65 to 75 years of age who have smoked at least 100 cigarettes, but screening is not recommended for carotid, peripheral, and renal disease. Surgical revascularization decreases adverse outcomes and mortality in selected patients with advanced vascular disease. Endovascular repair has become more common for patients younger than 70 years because of decreased short-term mortality. Carotid revascularization with carotid endarterectomy or carotid artery stenting is recommended for symptomatic patients with greater than 50% internal carotid artery stenosis. Carotid artery stenting is preferred in patients with multiple comorbidities, tracheostomy, or previous neck radiation or dissection. In patients older than 70 years, carotid endarterectomy is associated with a lower risk of periprocedural stroke or death than carotid artery stenting. Revascularization is a reasonable treatment option for patients with lifestyle-limiting claudication and an inadequate response to guideline-directed therapies. Revascularization is indicated for patients with critical limb ischemia and is emergently indicated for acute limb ischemia. Renal artery revascularization offers no proven clinical benefit when added to optimal medical therapy.",

        "Abstract":"BACKGROUND: Kawasaki disease is an idiopathic medium-sized vasculitis that occurs primarily in infants and children younger than 5 years of age. Atypical Kawasaki disease applies to patients who do not fulfill the complete criteria of fever of 5 days or more with at least four of five features: bilateral conjunctival injection, changes in the lips and oral cavity, cervical lymphadenopathy, extremity changes, and polymorphous rash. Acute kidney injury is defined as a sudden decline in kidney function within hours, including structural injuries and loss of function. Acute kidney injury is extremely common in hospitalized pediatric patients. However, it is rarely documented in Kawasaki disease. Acute kidney injury is underestimated in Kawasaki disease due to the lack of a clear definition of age-specific normal serum creatinine levels and routine renal functions. This report describes a case who presented with clinical features suggestive of atypical Kawasaki disease and developed acute kidney injury.\nCASE PRESENTATION: A 2-year-old Saudi girl had a history of high-grade fever for 5 days, moderate dehydration, dry cracked lips, poor appetite, and generalized erythematous rash; therefore, she was diagnosed to have incomplete Kawasaki disease. Laboratory investigations revealed normochromic normocytic anemia, leukocytosis, thrombocytosis, high inflammatory markers, and acute kidney injury stage III. An echocardiogram showed a 4-mm dilatation on the left main coronary artery and a 3-mm dilatation on the right. A renal biopsy was not performed to identify the cause of the injury as it showed improvements after the start of the specific therapy for Kawasaki disease; intravenous immune globulin at a dose of 2 g\/kg, aspirin at a high dosage of 80 mg\/kg\/day, and prednisolone at 2 mg\/kg. In addition to the acute kidney injury management, normal saline boluses were followed by furosemide at a 2 mg\/kg dose. Her urine output increased, and her renal functions normalized. She was discharged in good condition after 10 days.\nCONCLUSIONS: It is valuable to check renal function tests in a confirmed case of Kawasaki disease to reduce the negative consequences of late acute kidney injury discovery. Early detection and intervention make a substantial difference in acute kidney injury management.",

        "Abstract":"OBJECTIVE: To investigate the factors leading to the development of gastrointestinal bleeding (GIB) by comparing patients with diabetes mellitus Type 2 (T2DM) with dyspeptic complaints without GIB; and patients with T2DM who had GIB, regardless of the presence of helicobacter pylori.\nSTUDY DESIGN: Analytical study.\nPLACE AND DURATION OF STUDY: Department of Endocrinology and Gastroenterology, Faculty of Medicine, Karadeniz Technical University, from January 2018 to June 2019.\nMETHODOLOGY: The patients were divided into GIB and dyspepsia groups. After the identification of patients in both groups, demographic characteristics, drugs, comorbidities, presence of diabetic macro- and micro-vascular complications, and endoscopic findings were examined retrospectively for each patient.\nRESULTS: There were 106 patients, with 53 patients in each group. Mean age was significantly higher in the GIB group compared to the dyspepsia group (p<0.001). Body mass index (BMI) was significantly lower in the GIB group (p<0.001). Frequency of congestive heart failure (CHF), chronic kidney disease (CKD), and cerebrovascular disease (CVD), heart valve disease, and cardiac arrhythmia was significantly higher in GIB group (p <0.05 for all). No significant correlation was found between acetylsalicylic acid (ASA) use and GIB (p=0.103). The use of nonsteroidal anti-inflammatory drugs (NSAID), novel oral anticoagulants (NOAC), and clopidogrel was significantly higher in the GIB group (p=0.032, p=0.031, and p=0.032, respectively). Proton pump inhibitor (PPI) use was significantly higher in the dyspepsia group (p=0.002).\nCONCLUSION: Age, and poly medications were associated with increased frequency of GIB. The use of ASA, when not administered with other agents that may induce GIB, does not increase the risk of developing GIB in obese T2DM patients younger than 65 years of age, who have increased HbA1c levels.

        "Abstract":"BACKGROUND: The prevalence of atrial fibrillation (AF) and atrial flutter (AFl) increases with age. Under-prescription of anticoagulants in older adults can lead to increased morbidity and mortality. We analyzed warfarin prescription patterns in older adults.\nMETHODS: In this observational single-center study, we analyzed 2179 consecutive patients with admission diagnosis of AF or AFl. Patients were divided into \"older\" (≥ 75 years old) and \"younger\" (<75 years old) groups. Prescription patterns of warfarin were analyzed. Patients discharged from the hospital on a non-warfarin anticoagulation were excluded.\nRESULTS: Of the 1988 patients analyzed, 46.9% were ≥75 years old, of which 50.8% were prescribed warfarin. There was no association between mean CHADS-VASc score and warfarin prescription on discharge (OR = 1.06 (95% CI 0.93-1.21), p = 0.388) in the older group. After adjusting for hypertension, renal function, and Black race, warfarin prescription in older adults was independently associated with lower aspirin prescription rates (OR = 0.57 (95% CI 0.43-0.75), p < 0.001), lower body mass index (OR = 1.03 (95% CI 1.01-1.06), p = 0.018), and lower hemoglobin levels (OR = 1.11 (95% CI 1.04-1.19), p = 0.002).\nCONCLUSIONS: In our study, older adults (≥75 years old) with AF and AFl tended to have lower rates of warfarin prescription despite higher CHADS-VASc score and higher risk of thromboembolic events. Anemia, lower body weight, and aspirin use were characteristics associated with warfarin under-prescription.",

        "Abstract":"OBJECTIVE: To clarify high-risk factors for adverse pregnancy outcomes (APOs) in systemic lupus erythaematosus (SLE).\nDESIGN: A retrospective chart review study.\nSETTING: Data were collected in a tertiary medical centre, Shanghai, China, from November 2010 to December 2018.\nPARTICIPANTS: A total of 513 pregnancies with SLE were retrospectively analysed. Twenty-seven patients who underwent artificial abortions due to personal reasons were excluded.\nPRIMARY OUTCOME MEASURES: APOs were primary outcomes, including foetal loss, premature birth, small for gestational age (SGA), asphyxia neonatorum, composite foetal APOs and hypertensive disorders of pregnancy (HDP). Multivariable logistic regression and Spearman correlation analysis were performed to determine the risk factors for APOs in SLE.\nRESULTS: Risk factors for foetal loss included prepregnancy hypertension, hypocomplementaemia-C3, anticardiolipin antibodies-IgM positivity and disease flares during pregnancy. Risk factors for premature birth included disease flares, use of immunosuppressive agents and HDP. Moreover, twin pregnancy, disease flares and HDP were risk factors for SGA, and prepregnancy hypertension was an independent risk factor for asphyxia neonatorum. Independent risk factors for composite foetal APOs included twin pregnancy, prepregnancy hypertension, disease flares during pregnancy, HDP, hypocomplementaemia-C3 and the use of immunosuppressive agents. Risk factors for SLE complicated with HDP included prepregnancy hypertension, renal disorders and thrombocytopaenia. Conversely, the use of aspirin was a protective factor against foetal loss and premature birth. The ds-DNA value had a low diagnostic value for APOs, whereas the extent of complement reduction may predict the incidence of composite foetal APOs and foetal loss. Proteinuria occurring in the first 20 gestational weeks may lead to APOs.\nCONCLUSION: Established risk factors for each APO were identified in this study. Indicators with more predictive significance have been screened out from conventional indicators, which may help clinicians predict the pregnancy outcome of patients with SLE more accurately and minimise the incidence of APOs.",

We evaluate the clinical impact of pregnancy in a cohort of Portuguese SLE patients and the risk factors associated with maternal and fetal adverse outcomes.\nMETHODS: A retrospective observational study that included all pregnant women with SLE managed at a Portuguese tertiary hospital, between January 1993 and December 2019. Baseline maternal information was collected, and maternal-fetal and neonatal outcomes were evaluated. Disease activity before and during pregnancy was assessed.\nRESULTS: We included 215 pregnancies from 143 patients. Lupus nephritis was present in 20.0% and antiphospholipid syndrome (APS) in 21.9% of the cases. Preconception consultation was performed in 86.9% of the pregnancies, and 92.5% of the patients had no or low disease activity at conception. During gestation, 79.6% of the patients were under treatment, and hydroxychloroquine (HCQ) was the most commonly used drug (63.7%). Low-dose acetylsalicylic acid (ASA) was prescribed at conception in 87.9% of the patients. The live birth rate was 84.2%. An adverse pregnancy outcome (APO) occurred in 41.4% of the pregnancies. A miscarriage rate of 15.3% and a preterm delivery rate of 15.4% were found. Preeclampsia and fetal growth restriction complicated 13.1% and 14.0% of the gestations, respectively. Neonatal lupus occurred in 7.1% of the newborns, and there were 2 cases of congenital heart block. Significant risk factors for the development of AOP were disease activity at conception, lupus flare, hypocomplementemia, positivity for lupus anticoagulant, and APS. The use of ASA was significantly associated with a reduced incidence of miscarriage. An SLE flare was diagnosed in 16.3% of the cases. We identified as risk factors for lupus flares the presence of active disease at conception, a previous history of lupus nephritis, and the use of chronic medication. HCQ use during pregnancy was associated with a significant reduction of flare incidence during pregnancy and postpartum.\nCONCLUSIONS: Pregnancy in an SLE patient is associated with an increased incidence of adverse obstetric outcomes. Good disease control before pregnancy and adequate treatment, especially with HCQ, is crucial to achieving the best obstetric results.",

        "Published":"2021-10-22",
        "Abstract":"BACKGROUND: Evidence for aspirin efficacy testing in pediatrics is limited, especially outside of cardiology, yet thrombotic events have high morbidity in other areas such as pediatric transplant surgery. Debates about whether thromboembolic events while on aspirin represent \"aspirin resistance\" or \"high on-treatment platelet reactivity\" persist, given the poor intertest agreement between testing platforms.\nPROCEDURE: This prospective observational study involved measuring aspirin efficacy using ex vivo testing of platelet aggregation (VerifyNow-Aspirin, VN) and urine 11-dehydrothromboxane B2 (AsprinWorks, UTxB2) contemporaneously at up to three time points after major noncardiac organ transplant surgery. The collection days (CD) were the second and seventh days after stable aspirin dosing and then a convalescent time point 2-9 months later.\nRESULTS: Fifty-five participants (age range, 0-21 years) were enrolled, having undergone total pancreatectomy with islet autotransplantation (N = 36), orthotopic liver transplantation (N = 18), and combined liver-kidney transplantation (N = 1). Platelet reactivity measured by VN remained unchanged, whereas UTxB2, which was elevated postoperatively, decreased significantly from CD1 to CD2 and CD3. Discordance in therapeutic efficacy was noted per manufacturer cutoffs, with therapeutic VN results in 86% of tests, whereas 12% of UTxB2 were therapeutic. Age-based stratification of UTxB2 results using previously published pediatric median levels increased overall UTxB2 therapeutic rates (80%) and intertest concordance (67% vs 27% if using adult range). No thrombotic events were observed.\nCONCLUSIONS: Our data suggest that urine thromboxane production may be an underappreciated reflection of postoperative inflammation. Validation of pediatric normal ranges for UTxB2 is a critical next step.",

This study aims to compare the safety and effectiveness between the bursa omentalis approach (BOA) and medial-to-lateral approach (MTLA) in laparoscopic radical resection of left-sided colon cancer.  A retrospective cohort study was conducted. Inclusion criteria: (1) patients underwent radical resection of left hemicolon cancer; (2) the postoperative pathological result was adenocarcinoma; (3) patients aged 18-80 years old; (4) no liver, peritoneal or other distant metastasis. Exclusion criteria: (1) poor physical condition with serious heart, brain, lung, liver, kidney and hematopoietic system diseases; (2) unable to tolerate laparoscopic surgery; (3) history of other malignancies simultaneously, or multisource tumors; (4) emergency operation due to bleeding, obstruction, perforation, etc. Clinical data of 189 patients who underwent laparoscopic left hemicolectomy in the Guangdong Provincial Hospital of Chinese Medicine from 2014 to 2020 were retrospectively analyzed. According to surgical approaches, patients were divided into the BOA group (52 cases) and MTLA group (137 cases). The whole group of patients were matched by propensity score matching (PSM) according to the nearest neighbor matching method. The caliper value was 0.01. The matching variables included gender, age, American Society of Anesthesiologists (ASA) score, body mass index, tumor location and tumor stage. After PSM, 47 patients were included in the BOA group and MTLA group, respectively. There were no significant differences in baseline data between the two groups after PSM (all >0.05). Paired -test, paired rank sum test and paired Chi-square test were used to compare intraoperative and postoperative paramether between the two groups. Kaplan-Meier method was used to draw the survival curve, and log rank test was used for inter group comparison. When the two survival curves intersect, the two-stage method and restricted mean survival time (RMST) were further performed.  Both groups of patients successfully completed the operation without conversion to laparotomy or intraoperative death. No combined splenectomy or pancreatectomy were performed in the two groups. There were also no significant differences in intraoperative blood loss, number of harvested lymph nodes, time to the first flatus and the length of hospital stay between the two groups (all >0.05). However, the median laparoscopic dissection time in the BOA group was shorter than that in the MTLA group, and the difference was statistically significant (median: 56 minutes vs. 65 minutes, =0.032). No entry to posterior pancreatic space was recorded in the BOA group but wrong entry to posterior pancreatic space happened to 6.4% (3\/47) of patients (body mass index >25 kg\/m(2)) when dissecting left Toldt's fascia in the MTLA group. The 3-year disease-free survival rate in BOA group and MTLA group was 90.2% and 86.1%, respectively (=0.909) and the 3-year overall survival rate was 85.6% and 94.4%, respectively (=0.532).  BOA is safe and feasible in laparoscopic left hemicolectomy, especially for inexperienced surgeons. For obese patients, BOA facilitates the entrance into the correct anatomical level and avoid entering the retropancreatic space.",

        "Abstract":"BACKGROUND AND PURPOSE: The age, body mass index, chronic kidney disease, diabetes, and genotyping (ABCD-GENE) score is a validated risk score integrating CYP2C19 genotypes with clinical risk factors influencing clopidogrel response that would allow the more precise identification of subjects at risk for high platelet reactivity and adverse clinical outcomes. Our objective was to further verify application of the ABCD-GENE score and investigate appropriate cutoff value in patients with minor stroke or transient ischemic attack.\nMETHODS: In this post-analysis of the CHANCE trial (Clopidogrel in High-Risk Patients With Acute Nondisabling Cerebrovascular Events), the ABCD-GENE score was calculated for all patients enrolled in this study. By using the proposed cutoff of 10, patients were stratified as being at high risk for high platelet reactivity or not. We further categorized the ABCD-GENE score to 0 to 5, 6 to 24, and >24 to investigate the cutoff value of this scale in clinical application. Stroke recurrence at 3 months was considered as the primary outcome.\nRESULTS: Among a total of 2923 patients with minor stroke\/transient ischemic attack, there were 2273 (77.76%) with ABCD-GENE score <10 and 650 (22.24%) patients with ABCD-GENE score ≥10. Compared with the aspirin alone, hazard ratios (95% CIs) of the clopidogrel-aspirin therapy for stroke recurrence were 0.70 (0.54-0.91) and 0.76 (0.46-1.24), among patients of ABCD-GENE scores <10 and ABCD-GENE scores ≥10, respectively. Stratified analyses by ABCD-GENE score 0 to 5, 6 to 24, and >24, hazard ratios of the clopidogrel-aspirin therapy for stroke recurrence were 0.57 (95% CI, 0.38-0.85), 0.78 (0.58-1.06), and 1.20 (0.44-3.28) ( value for trend=0.0052).\nCONCLUSIONS: Among Chinese minor stroke\/transient ischemic attack population, the efficacy of clopidogrel-aspirin therapy was decreased in patients with higher ABCD-GENE score. Our study suggests that CYP2C19 genotypes and clinical risk factors can be integrated by ABCD-GENE score to estimate the efficacy of clopidogrel-aspirin therapy.",

Pregnant women at a high risk of developing PE were recruited and randomized into an intervention group (40) and a control group (40). The inclusion criteria consisted of pregnant women with positive clinical risk factor and abnormal uterine artery Doppler examination at 10 to 20 weeks' gestational age. The control group received low dose aspirin (80 mg\/day) and calcium (1 g\/day), while the intervention group received additional pravastatin (20-mg twice daily) starting from 14 to 20 weeks' gestation until delivery. Research blood samples were collected before the first dose of pravastatin and before delivery. The main outcome was the rate of maternal PE, maternal-perinatal outcomes, and sFlt-1, PlGF, sFlt-1\/PlGF ratio, and soluble endoglin (sEng) levels.\nRESULTS: The rate of PE was (nonsignificantly) lower in the pravastatin group compared with the control group (17.5 vs. 35%). The pravastatin group also had a (nonsignificant) lower rate of severe PE, HELLP (hemolysis, elevated liver enzymes and low platelets) syndrome, acute kidney injury, and severe hypertension. The rate of (iatrogenic) preterm delivery was significantly ( = 0.048) lower in the pravastatin group ( = 4) compared with the controls ( = 12). Neonates in the pravastatin group had significantly higher birth weights (2,931 ± 537 vs. 2,625 ± 872 g;  = 0.006), lower Apgar's scores < 7 (2.5 vs. 27.5%,  = 0.002), composite neonatal morbidity (0 vs. 20%,  = 0.005), and NICU admission rates (0 vs. 15%,  = 0.026). All biomarkers show a significant deterioration in the control group compared with nonsignificant changes in the pravastatin group.\nCONCLUSION: Pravastatin holds promise in the secondary prevention of PE and placenta-mediated adverse perinatal outcomes by improving the angiogenic imbalance.\nKEY POINTS: · Prophylactic pravastatin was associated with a significantly lower rate of adverse perinatal outcome.. · The sFlt1\/PlGF ratio stabilized in the pravastatin group compared with a deterioration in the control group.. · Pravastatin holds promise in the secondary prevention of PE and placenta-mediated adverse perinatal outcomes..",

        "Abstract":"2\nDual antiplatelet therapy (DAPT) was currently recommended for transcatheter aortic valve implantation (TAVI) postoperative management in clinical application. However, POPular-TAVI trial showed DAPT increased the incidence of adverse events compared to single antiplatelet therapy (SAPT). Herein, we performed a meta-analysis to investigate the effect of SAPT versus DAPT on the adverse events after TAVI. Eleven studies were available from PubMed, Embase, Cochrane Library, and Web of Science from inception to April 1, 2021. The pooled effect size was presented as relative risk (RR) with 95% confidence intervals (CIs). The sensitivity analysis was used to assess the stability of analysis results, and Begg's test was applied to evaluate the publication bias. The Cochran Q test and the I statistic were used to evaluate the heterogeneity, and the source of heterogeneity was explored by meta-regression. A total of 4804 patients were obtained, with 2257 in SAPT group and 2547 in DAPT group. Compared to the DAPT, SAPT was associated with the decreased risk of all-cause bleeding (RR: 0.51, 95% CI: 0.44-0.61), major bleeding (RR: 0.53, 95% CI: 0.32-0.86), and minor bleeding (RR: 0.58, 95% CI: 0.34-0.98). There were no significant differences in mortality and myocardial infarction events, stroke events, and acute kidney injury between the two groups. SAPT was superior to DAPT in decreasing all-cause bleeding, major bleeding, and minor bleeding, suggesting that SAPT could be preferentially recommended for TAVI postoperative management in most patients without another indication for DAPT and oral anticoagulation.",

        "Abstract":"BACKGROUND: Multiple myeloma is a malignant plasma cell disorder characterised by clonal plasma cells that cause end-organ damage such as renal failure, lytic bone lesions, hypercalcaemia and\/or anaemia. People with multiple myeloma are treated with immunomodulatory agents including lenalidomide, pomalidomide, and thalidomide. Multiple myeloma is associated with an increased risk of thromboembolism, which appears to be further increased in people receiving immunomodulatory agents.\nOBJECTIVES: (1) To systematically review the evidence for the relative efficacy and safety of aspirin, oral anticoagulants, or parenteral anticoagulants in ambulatory patients with multiple myeloma receiving immunomodulatory agents who otherwise have no standard therapeutic or prophylactic indication for anticoagulation. (2) To maintain this review as a living systematic review by continually running the searches and incorporating newly identified studies.\nSEARCH METHODS: We conducted a comprehensive literature search that included (1) a major electronic search (14 June 2021) of the following databases: Cochrane Central Register of Controlled Trials (CENTRAL) in The Cochrane Library, MEDLINE via Ovid, and Embase via Ovid; (2) hand-searching of conference proceedings; (3) checking of reference lists of included studies; and (4) a search for ongoing studies in trial registries. As part of the living systematic review approach, we are running continual searches, and we will incorporate new evidence rapidly after it is identified.\nSELECTION CRITERIA: Randomised controlled trials (RCTs) assessing the benefits and harms of oral anticoagulants such as vitamin K antagonist (VKA) and direct oral anticoagulants (DOAC), anti-platelet agents such as aspirin (ASA), and parenteral anticoagulants such as low molecular weight heparin (LMWH)in ambulatory patients with multiple myeloma receiving immunomodulatory agents.\nDATA COLLECTION AND ANALYSIS: Using a standardised form, we extracted data in duplicate on study design, participants, interventions, outcomes of interest, and risk of bias. Outcomes of interest included all-cause mortality, symptomatic deep vein thrombosis (DVT), pulmonary embolism (PE), major bleeding, and minor bleeding. For each outcome we calculated the risk ratio (RR) with its 95% confidence interval (CI) and the risk difference (RD) with its 95% CI. We then assessed the certainty of evidence at the outcome level following the GRADE approach (GRADE Handbook).\nMAIN RESULTS: We identified 1015 identified citations and included 11 articles reporting four RCTs that enrolled 1042 participants. The included studies made the following comparisons: ASA versus VKA (one study); ASA versus LMWH (two studies); VKA versus LMWH (one study); and ASA versus DOAC (two studies, one of which was an abstract). ASA versus VKA One RCT compared ASA to VKA at six months follow-up. The data did not confirm or exclude a beneficial or detrimental effect of ASA relative to VKA on all-cause mortality (RR 3.00, 95% CI 0.12 to 73.24; RD 2 more per 1000, 95% CI 1 fewer to 72 more; very low-certainty evidence); symptomatic DVT (RR 0.57, 95% CI 0.24 to 1.33; RD 27 fewer per 1000, 95% CI 48 fewer to 21 more; very low-certainty evidence); PE (RR 1.00, 95% CI 0.25 to 3.95; RD 0 fewer per 1000, 95% CI 14 fewer to 54 more; very low-certainty evidence); major bleeding (RR 7.00, 95% CI 0.36 to 134.72; RD 6 more per 1000, 95% CI 1 fewer to 134 more; very low-certainty evidence); and minor bleeding (RR 6.00, 95% CI 0.73 to 49.43; RD 23 more per 1000, 95% CI 1 fewer to 220 more; very low-certainty evidence). One RCT compared ASA to VKA at two years follow-up. The data did not confirm or exclude a beneficial or detrimental effect of ASA relative to VKA on all-cause mortality (RR 0.50, 95% CI 0.05 to 5.47; RD 5 fewer per 1000, 95% CI 9 fewer to 41 more; very low-certainty evidence); symptomatic DVT (RR 0.71, 95% CI 0.35 to 1.44; RD 22 fewer per 1000, 95% CI 50 fewer to 34 more; very low-certainty evidence); and PE (RR 1.00, 95% CI 0.25 to 3.95; RD 0 fewer per 1000, 95% CI 14 fewer to 54 more; very low-certainty evidence). ASA versus LMWH Two RCTs compared ASA to LMWH at six months follow-up. The pooled data did not confirm or exclude a beneficial or detrimental effect of ASA relative to LMWH on all-cause mortality (RR 1.00, 95% CI 0.06 to 15.81; RD 0 fewer per 1000, 95% CI 2 fewer to 38 more; very low-certainty evidence); symptomatic DVT (RR 1.23, 95% CI 0.49 to 3.08; RD 5 more per 1000, 95% CI 11 fewer to 43 more; very low-certainty evidence); PE (RR 7.71, 95% CI 0.97 to 61.44; RD 7 more per 1000, 95% CI 0 fewer to 60 more; very low-certainty evidence); major bleeding (RR 6.97, 95% CI 0.36 to 134.11; RD 6 more per 1000, 95% CI 1 fewer to 133 more; very low-certainty evidence); and minor bleeding (RR 1.42, 95% CI 0.35 to 5.78; RD 4 more per 1000, 95% CI 7 fewer to 50 more; very low-certainty evidence). One RCT compared ASA to LMWH at two years follow-up. The pooled data did not confirm or exclude a beneficial or detrimental effect of ASA relative to LMWH on all-cause mortality (RR 1.00, 95% CI 0.06 to 15.89; RD 0 fewer per 1000, 95% CI 4 fewer to 68 more; very low-certainty evidence); symptomatic DVT (RR 1.20, 95% CI 0.53 to 2.72; RD 9 more per 1000, 95% CI 21 fewer to 78 more; very low-certainty evidence); and PE (RR 9.00, 95% CI 0.49 to 166.17; RD 8 more per 1000, 95% CI 1 fewer to 165 more; very low-certainty evidence). VKA versus LMWH One RCT compared VKA to LMWH at six months follow-up. The data did not confirm or exclude a beneficial or detrimental effect of VKA relative to LMWH on all-cause mortality (RR 0.33, 95% CI 0.01 to 8.10; RD 3 fewer per 1000, 95% CI 5 fewer to 32 more; very low-certainty evidence); symptomatic DVT (RR 2.32, 95% CI 0.91 to 5.93; RD 36 more per 1000, 95% CI 2 fewer to 135 more; very low-certainty evidence); PE (RR 8.96, 95% CI 0.49 to 165.42; RD 8 more per 1000, 95% CI 1 fewer to 164 more; very low-certainty evidence); and minor bleeding (RR 0.33, 95% CI 0.03 to 3.17; RD 9 fewer per 1000, 95% CI 13 fewer to 30 more; very low-certainty evidence). The study reported that no major bleeding occurred in either arm. One RCT compared VKA to LMWH at two years follow-up. The data did not confirm or exclude a beneficial or detrimental effect of VKA relative to LMWH on all-cause mortality (RR 2.00, 95% CI 0.18 to 21.90; RD 5 more per 1000, 95% CI 4 fewer to 95 more; very low-certainty evidence); symptomatic DVT (RR 1.70, 95% CI 0.80 to 3.63; RD 32 more per 1000, 95% CI 9 fewer to 120 more; very low-certainty evidence); and PE (RR 9.00, 95% CI 0.49 to 166.17; RD 8 more per 1000, 95% CI 1 fewer to 165 more; very low-certainty evidence). ASA versus DOAC One RCT compared ASA to DOAC at six months follow-up. The data did not confirm or exclude a beneficial or detrimental effect of ASA relative to DOAC on DVT, PE, and major bleeding and minor bleeding (minor bleeding: RR 5.00, 95% CI 0.31 to 79.94; RD 4 more per 1000, 95% CI 1 fewer to 79 more; very low-certainty evidence). The study reported that no DVT, PE, or major bleeding events occurred in either arm. These results did not change in a meta-analysis including the study published as an abstract.\nAUTHORS' CONCLUSIONS: The certainty of the available evidence for the comparative effects of ASA, VKA, LMWH, and DOAC on all-cause mortality, DVT, PE, or bleeding was either low or very low. People with multiple myeloma considering antithrombotic agents should balance the possible benefits of reduced thromboembolic complications with the possible harms and burden of anticoagulants.

        "Abstract":"OBJECTIVE: To explore the clinical effects of aspirin combined with low-molecular-weight heparin (LMWH) in the treatment of patients with severe preeclampsia and the combination's influence on pregnancy outcomes.\nMETHODS: From October 2018 to June 2020, 104 patients with severe preeclampsia who underwent treatment in our hospital were recruited as the study cohort and divided into two groups according to different treatment scheme each patient underwent. In the research group (RG), the 54 patients were administered aspirin combined with LMWH, and the other 50 patients in the control group (CG) were administered routine treatment. The total effective rates were compared between the two groups. The blood pressure, coagulation function, hemorheology, and renal function indexes were compared before and after the therapy. The Apgar scores of the newborns and the incidences of adverse pregnancy outcomes were measured at 1 and 5 minutes after the births.\nRESULTS: After the therapy, the systolic blood pressure (SBP) and the diastolic blood pressure (DBP) in the RG were lower than they were in the CG. The PT and APTT in the RG were significantly higher than they were in the CG, and the FIB and D-D were significantly lower than they were in the CG. After the treatment, the hematocrit, the erythrocyte sedimentation rate, and the plasma viscosity in the RG were significantly lower than they were in the CG. The 24 h UP, BUN, UA, and Scr levels in the RG were significantly lower than they were in the CG. The Apgar scores of the newborns in the RG were significantly higher than they were in the CG at 1 min and 5 min after the births. After the therapy, the incidence of adverse pregnancy outcomes in the RG was significantly lower than it was in the CG, and the total effective rate in the RG was significantly higher than it was in the CG.\nCONCLUSION: Aspirin combined with LMWH can effectively improve the clinical efficacy, the coagulation function, the renal function, and the blood pressure levels, and the combination can reduce adverse pregnancy outcomes in severe preeclampsia patients.",

        "Abstract":"BACKGROUND: The present study intended to estimate the comorbidities and risk factors among patients with hypertension in India. Further, the current practice of hypertension management was evaluated and the choice of therapy was assessed based on hypertension grade, risk factors, and comorbidities.\nMETHODS: Electronic medical record data (June 2017-June 2019) of Indian adult hypertensive patients (≥140\/90 mmHg) who had two blood pressure (BP) readings were retrospectively analyzed. Demographic characteristics, BP readings, comorbidities, medications and co-medications, and laboratory data were collected at baseline. Grids based on hypertension grade (I, II, and III), demographic factors, risk factors, and comorbidities were created and prescribed antihypertensive drugs (AHDs) in each grid were evaluated.\nRESULTS: Among 100,075 patients, the proportion of patients in 18-40 year, 40-65 year, and &gt;65 year age groups were 11.4%, 65.1%, and 23.4%, respectively. Proportion of men and women was similar (52.0% vs 47.9%). Proportion of patients with BMI &lt;25 Kg\/m2 was 8.1%, 25-29.9 Kg\/m2 was 11.9%, and &gt;30 Kg\/m2 was 8.8%. Mean BP of patients with hypertension was: grade I (145.05\/90.73 mmHg), grade II (160.07\/95.64 mmHg), and grade III (180.82\/102.76 mmHg). Mean low density lipoprotein (113.26 mg\/dL), serum creatinine (2.28 mg\/dL), mean HbA1c (8.7%) levels were highest among patients with grade III hypertension. Commonly observed comorbidities were type 2 diabetes mellitus (T2DM: 51.5%), dyslipidemia (36.4%), and chronic kidney disease (CKD: 4.4%). Top concomitant medications included anti-diabetic therapies (34.6%), drugs for dyslipidemia (30.0%), and anti-platelet therapies (6.9%).\nCONCLUSION: Most prescribed AHD monotherapies were angiotensin receptor II blockers (ARBs) and calcium channel blockers (CCBs) and most prescribed combination therapies were ARBs + diuretics and ARBs + CCBs.

        "Abstract":"AIMS: Cardiovascular disease (CVD) is the major cause of morbidity and mortality in individuals with chronic kidney disease (CKD). This study assessed the risks and benefits of aspirin in the primary prevention of CVD in individuals with CKD.\nMETHODS AND RESULTS: Ovid MEDLINE was searched from 2015 to 15th of September 2020 to include randomized controlled trials that assessed aspirin versus placebo in adults with non-end stage CKD without a previous diagnosis of CVD. A pre-specified protocol was registered with PROSPERO (identification number CRD42014008860). A random effects model was used to calculate a pooled hazard ratio (HR), pooled risk difference, and the number needed to treat or harm (NNT\/NNH). The primary endpoint was CVD. Secondary endpoints included: all-cause mortality; coronary heart disease; stroke; and major and minor bleeding events. Five trials were identified (n = 7852 total, n = 3935 aspirin, n = 3917 placebo). Overall, 434 CVD events occurred. There was no statistically significant reduction in CVD events (HR 0.76, 95% confidence interval (CI) 0.54-1.08; P = 0.13, I2 = 63%), all-cause mortality (HR 0.94, 95% CI 0.74-1.19; P = 0.60, I2 = 21%), coronary heart disease events (HR 0.66, 95% CI 0.27-1.63; P = 0.37, I2 = 64%) or stroke (HR 0.87, 95% CI 0.6-1.27; P = 0.48, I2 = 24%) from aspirin therapy. The risk of major bleeding events were increased by approximately 50% (HR 1.53, 95% CI 1.13-2.05; P = 0.01, I2 = 0%) and minor bleeding events were more than doubled (HR 2.64, 95% CI 1.64-4.23; P < 0.01, I2 = 0%).\nCONCLUSIONS: Aspirin cannot be routinely recommended for the primary prevention of CVD in individuals with CKD as there is no evidence for its benefit but there is an increased risk of bleeding.",

        "Abstract":"OBJECTIVE: The aim of this study was to examine the external applicability of the COMPASS and the VOYAGER-PAD trials in patients with lower extremity artery disease (LEAD) in the real world.\nMETHODS: This was a multicentre retrospective analysis of prospectively collected COPART data, a French multicentre registry of patients hospitalised for symptomatic LEAD. The proportion of patients eligible for the combination of rivaroxaban 2.5 mg twice daily plus aspirin based on either COMPASS or VOYAGER-PAD criteria is reported. The one year cumulative incidence of outcomes between eligible and non-eligible patients, as well as eligible patients vs. control arms of the COMPASS (LEAD patient subgroup) and the VOYAGER-PAD trials were compared. Analyses were performed using Cox models.\nRESULTS: Of 2 259 evaluable patients, only 679 (30.1%) were eligible for a low dose rivaroxaban plus aspirin regimen. Others were not eligible because of the need for anticoagulant (48.5% and 38.9% of patients meeting COMPASS and VOYAGER-PAD exclusion criteria, respectively) or dual antiplatelet therapy use (15.7% and 16.5%, respectively), high bleeding risk (14.4% and 11.6%, respectively), malignancy (26.1% and 21.0%, respectively), history of ischaemic\/haemorrhagic stroke (21.1% and 19.8%, respectively), and severe renal failure (13.2% and 10.5%, respectively). COMPASS and VOYAGER-PAD eligible and ineligible patients were at higher risk of ischaemic events than participants in these trials. The one year cumulative incidences were 6.0% (95% CI 4.3 - 8.1) in the COMPASS eligible subset vs. 3.5% (95% CI 2.9 - 4.3) in the COMPASS control arm for major adverse cardiovascular events, and 27.9% (95% CI 19.9 - 38.3) in the VOYAGER-PAD eligible subset vs. 6.0% (95% CI 5.3 - 6.9) in the VOYAGER-PAD control arm for major adverse limb events.\nCONCLUSION: Many patients hospitalised for symptomatic LEAD in France are not eligible for the low dose rivaroxaban plus aspirin combination. In turn, those eligible may potentially have greater absolute benefit because of higher risk than those enrolled in the trials.",

        "Abstract":"INTRODUCTION: Little is known about the relationship between exposure levels of mycophenolic acid (MPA), the active metabolite of mycophenolate mofetil (MMF), and comorbidities of systemic lupus erythematosus (SLE) in children. This study aims to explore this association.\nMETHODS: Longitudinal data from SLE children, who were taking MMF for immunosuppression and under therapeutic drug monitoring (TDM), were retrospectively collected. Area under the concentration-time curve of mycophenolic acid (MPA) over 24 hours (AUC) was estimated with Bayesian methods. Logistic regression and random forest models were used to explore the association between comorbidities and MPA exposure levels.\nRESULTS: This study included 107 children with 358 times of follow-up (median age 169.02 months). The incidence of diabetes, acute kidney injury (AKI), or pneumonia was significantly associated with AUC (odds ratio [OR] 0.991, 95% confidence interval [CI] 0.982-0.999), SLE duration (OR 1.012, 95% CI 1.002-1.022), lymphocyte percentage (OR 0.959, 95% CI 0.925-0.991), plasma albumin levels (OR 0.891, 95% CI 0.843-0.940), use of aspirin (OR 0.292, 95% CI 0.126-0.633) and hydroxychloroquine (OR 0.407, 95% CI 0.184-0.906). The random forest model showed that albumin and AUC were two important predictors. The case group (with the three comorbidities) had a mean AUC of 73.63 mg · h\/L, while the control group had a mean AUC of 100.39 mg · h\/L.\nCONCLUSIONS: Increased levels of MPA exposure are associated with decreased incidence odds of diabetes, AKI or pneumonia in SLE children. An AUC of 100.39 mg · h\/L or an AUC of 50.20 mg · h\/L could be used as the targeted exposure level for clinical practice.",

        "Published":"2021-07-20",
        "Abstract":"BACKGROUND AND AIM: Classical autoimmune hepatitis (AIH) is characterized by the presence of conventional autoantibodies (anti-smooth muscle, antinuclear and anti-liver-kidney-microsomal antibodies). The absence of such autoantibodies in some patients does not preclude AIH diagnosis or the need for its treatment. This group of patients was termed seronegative AIH. Whether non-conventional autoantibodies can identify this group of patients is still elusive. We aimed to study the prevalence of seronegativity of conventional autoantibodies and the occurrence of non-conventional autoantibodies in children with AIH.\nMETHODS: In this study, 55 children with AIH were investigated for non-conventional autoantibodies (anti-neutrophil cytoplasmic antibodies, antibodies to soluble liver antigen, anti-tissue transglutaminase and antiplatelet antibodies). All the patients received immunosuppressive therapy and were assessed for treatment response.\nRESULTS: Of the patients 44 had classical AIH (type 1, 70.09%, type 2, 9.09%) and 20% were seronegative. The four studied non-conventional autoantibodies occurred in four patients, one for each. All non-conventional autoantibodies were exclusively associated with type 1 AIH. The clinical profile, ultrasonographic findings, liver biochemistry and histopathological findings were comparable in the classical and seronegative AIH. The majority of patients with classical (72.7%) and seronegative (54.5%) AIH were treatment responders.\nCONCLUSION: Seronegative AIH represents a substantial percentage of pediatric patients diagnosed with AIH. They were even negative for non-conventional autoantibodies. Furthermore, apart from autoantibodies, seronegative AIH is almost indistinguishable from the classical AIH and the majority of patients were treatment responders. This favorable response to immunosuppression deserves sustainable efforts for considering such a diagnosis and start therapy to halt disease progression is worthwhile.",

This study aimed to evaluate the bleeding risk with CKD patients undergoing pentoxifylline (PTX) treatment with\/without aspirin. In this retrospective study, we used Taiwan's National Health Insurance Research Database to identify PTX treated CKD patients. Patients undergoing PTX treatment after CKD diagnosis were PTX group. A 1:4 age, sex and aspirin used condition matched CKD patients non-using PTX were identified as controls. The outcome was major bleeding event (MBE: intracranial haemorrhage (ICH) and gastrointestinal tract bleeding) during 2-year follow-up period. Risk factors were estimated using Cox regression for overall and stratified analysis. The PTX group had higher MBE risk than controls (hazard ratio (HR) 1.19; 95% confidence interval (CI) 0.94-1.50). In stratified analysis, hyperlipidaemia was a significant risk factor (HR: 1.42; 95% CI 1.01-2.01) of MBE. A daily PTX dose larger than 800 mg, females, non-regular aspirin usage, and ischaemic stroke were risk factors for MBE in PTX group. When prescribing PTX in CKD patients, bleeding should be closely monitored, especially in those with daily dose more than 800 mg, aspirin users, and with a history of ischaemic stroke.",

After adjustment for sociodemographic factors and conditions associated with both COVID-19 and preeclampsia, the risk ratio for preeclampsia remained significant among all women (risk ratio, 1.77; 95% confidence interval, 1.25-2.52) and nulliparous women specifically (risk ratio, 1.89; 95% confidence interval, 1.17-3.05). There was a trend but no statistical significance among parous women (risk ratio, 1.64; 95% confidence interval, 0.99-2.73). The risk ratio for preterm birth for all women diagnosed with COVID-19 and preeclampsia was 4.05 (95% confidence interval, 2.99-5.49) and 6.26 (95% confidence interval, 4.35-9.00) for nulliparous women. Compared with women with neither condition diagnosed, the composite adverse perinatal outcome showed a stepwise increase in the risk ratio for COVID-19 without preeclampsia, preeclampsia without COVID-19, and COVID-19 with preeclampsia (risk ratio, 2.16; 95% confidence interval, 1.63-2.86; risk ratio, 2.53; 95% confidence interval, 1.44-4.45; and risk ratio, 2.84; 95% confidence interval, 1.67-4.82, respectively). Similar findings were found for the composite adverse maternal outcome with risk ratios of 1.76 (95% confidence interval, 1.32-2.35), 2.07 (95% confidence interval, 1.20-3.57), and 2.77 (95% confidence interval, 1.66-4.63). The association between COVID-19 and gestational hypertension and the direction of the effects on preterm birth and adverse perinatal and maternal outcomes, were similar to preeclampsia, but confined to nulliparous women with lower risk ratios.\nCONCLUSION: COVID-19 during pregnancy is strongly associated with preeclampsia, especially among nulliparous women. This association is independent of any risk factors and preexisting conditions. COVID-19 severity does not seem to be a factor in this association. Both conditions are associated independently of and in an additive fashion with preterm birth, severe perinatal morbidity and mortality, and adverse maternal outcomes. Women with preeclampsia should be considered a particularly vulnerable group with regard to the risks posed by COVID-19.",

The retrospective study enrolled 903 patients with bioprosthetic valve replacement at our hospital and discharged with a diagnosis of AF from January 2010 to December 2018.  The median age was 65.6 (61.9-69.1) years, and 548 (60.7%) patients were women. During a follow-up period of 3.84 (2.64-5.51) years, 68 (1.8 per 100 person-years) patients died, 81 (2.1 per 100 person-years) patients developed thromboembolism, and 23 (0.6 per 100 person-years) patients experienced major bleeding. The CHADS-VASc score, as a categorical variable (low, moderate, or high risk), predicted the risk of thromboembolism with the C-statistic of 0.6 (95% CI: 0.511-0.689,  = 0.046). The incidence of the CHADS-VASc score increment was 11.6 per 100 person-years, and the annual reclassification rate of stroke risk (from a low or moderate group to a higher group) was 12.7%. The current proportion of oral anticoagulants was 52.3, 59, and 63.2%, respectively, in the low, moderate, and high stroke risk groups. Age (OR: 1.04, 95% CI: 1.01-1.06,  = 0.01), left atrial size (OR: 1.05, 95% CI: 1.03-1.08,  < 0.001), and rheumatic heart disease (OR: 1.49, 95% CI: 1.05-2.10,  = 0.025) were positively associated with the use of oral anticoagulants. The history of chronic kidney disease (OR: 0.20, 95% CI: 0.05-0.76,  = 0.018), prior surgical ablation (OR: 0.33, 95% CI: 0.24-0.47,  < 0.001), and antiplatelet agent use (OR: 0.08, 95% CI: 0.05-0.13,  < 0.001) were inversely related to the use of oral anticoagulants. Higher admission estimated glomerular filtration rate (HR: 0.515, 95% CI: 0.311-0.853,  = 0.01), left ventricular ejection fraction (HR: 0.961, 95% CI: 0.931-0.992,  = 0.014), concomitant surgical ablation (HR: 0.348, 95% CI: 0.171-0.711,  = 0.004), and rheumatic heart disease history (HR: 0.515, 95% CI: 0.311-0.853,  = 0.01) were associated with a lower risk of death. Surgical ablation (HR: 0.263, 95% CI: 0.133-0.519,  < 0.001) and oral anticoagulants (HR: 0.587, 95% CI: 0.375-0.918,  = 0.019) were related to a lower risk of thromboembolism.  Chinese patients with AF and bioprosthetic valve(s) were relatively young and had a high prevalence of rheumatic heart disease with few comorbidities. The percentage of mitral bioprosthetic valve replacement was high. The proportion of concomitant surgical ablation or surgical left atrial appendage occlusion or exclusion was relatively low. The thromboembolic events were the major long-term adverse events. The anticoagulation therapy was underused in patients at moderate or high stroke risk. The CHADS-VASc score was verified to be used for predicting stroke risk in this population. The stroke risk dynamically changed; it needed to be reestimated once the risk factor changed.",

This randomized multi-center clinical trial was performed with random division into three groups of 393 pregnant women with mild to moderate chronic hypertension. From the beginning of the pregnancy to the end of the puerperium, the low dosage aspirin group (n = 129), the labetalol group (n = 127), and the drug-free or control group (n = 126) reported both mother and child results. Major variations in the presence of severely motherly hypertension, pre-eclampsia, renal failure, ECG shifts, and cardiovascular rupture between treatment groups (low doses of aspirin and labetalol) and control groups were noted. Repeated placenta and blood pressure control hospitalizations. (P&lt;0.001) in the control group more often (untreated). The new babies were more vulnerable to gestational age (SGA), neonatal hypotension, neonatal Hyperbilirubinemia, and ICU (p &lt;0.001 in contrast with the low-dose aspirin and control groups). In the control group, the proportion of premature babies was considerably higher than in the treatment group (p&lt;0,05). A mild to moderate persistent high blood pressure during pregnancy therapy helps minimize mother and child occurrence. The use of labetalol is correlated with a higher incidence of SGA, neonatal hypotension, and neonatal hyperbilirubinemia relative to low-dose aspirin or control group.",

Multivariate logistic regression analysis from 4600 pregnancies during a 10-year period was used to create the best fitting model. Significant risk factors and weighted scores consisted of age ≥30 years (3), BMI ≥25 kg\/m (2), multifetal pregnancy (9), history of PE (9), adverse perinatal outcomes (6), pregnancy interval >10 years (5), nulliparous (5), underlying renal disease (10), chronic hypertension (6), autoimmune disease (5), diabetes (2) and MAP ≥95 mmHg (5). The model achieved an ROC area 0.771 with detection rates of 34%, 44%, 53% and 58% at 5%, 10%, 15% and 20% fixed false-positive rates, respectively. The new risk score model could be a clinically useful screening tool for PE. Pregnant women who have total scores of 9-13 (high risk) and more than 14 (very high risk) should receive aspirin prophylaxis.Impact Statement Preeclampsia (PE) is the major cause of maternal and perinatal mortality and morbidity; it can be prevented by antiplatelet agents. A new model for identifying maternal at risk for PE using clinical risk factors and MAP was created. Weighted scores were defined for each variable for easy use in clinical practice. According to their probability for PE, pregnant women were classified into three subgroups: low risk (score 0-8), high risk (score 9-13) and very high risk groups (score ≥ 14). Aspirin should be prescribed to high risk and very high risk groups. For safety concerns, very high risk pregnancies should have close antenatal surveillance in a tertiary care hospital to reduce adverse outcomes during pregnancy and childbirth. This new model for identifying pregnant women at high risk for PE has the potential to reduce the morbidity and mortality associated with this disease.",

Pregnancy management included blood pressure correction, antianemic, antiplatelet, anticoagulant therapy, prevention and treatment of urinary infection, correction of metabolic disorders. All pregnant women had proteinuria of varying severity, which increased towards the end of pregnancy. Seventeen (51.5%) patients had hypertension, successfully corrected with antihypertensive drugs. The average delivery term was 34.6 weeks. Preeclampsia developed in 14 (42.4%) cases, an inverse relationship was found between the presence of a physiological response and preeclampsia (p=0.009; rs=-0.463). All children were born alive and viable. After delivery in patients with CKD 3a creatinine values returned to the pre-gestational level, in patients with grade 3b and 4 progression of CKD was noted.\nCONCLUSION: A favorable pregnancy outcome in women with late stages of CKD is possible with constant monitoring by a multidisciplinary team of doctors with mandatory monitoring of renal function, proteinuria, blood pressure, coagulation, markers of preeclampsia and indicators of fetal health. It was proposed to consider the physiological response of the kidneys to pregnancy as a predictor of a favorable outcome.",

        "Published":"2021-05-24",
        "Abstract":"Veverimer is a polymer being developed as a potential treatment of metabolic acidosis in patients with chronic kidney disease. Veverimer selectively binds and removes hydrochloric acid from the gastrointestinal tract, resulting in an increase in serum bicarbonate. Veverimer is not systemically absorbed, so potential drug-drug interactions (DDIs) are limited to effects on the absorption of other oral drugs through binding to veverimer in the gastrointestinal tract or increases in gastric pH caused by veverimer binding to hydrochloric acid. In in vitro binding experiments using a panel of 16 test drugs, no positively charged, neutral, or zwitterionic drugs bound to veverimer. Three negatively charged drugs (furosemide, aspirin, ethacrynic acid) bound to veverimer; however, this binding was reduced or eliminated in the presence of normal physiologic concentrations (100-170 mM) of chloride. Veverimer increased gastric pH in vivo by 1.5-3 pH units. This pH elevation peaked within 1 hour and had returned to baseline after 1.5-3 hours. Omeprazole did not alter the effect of veverimer on gastric pH. The clinical relevance of in vitro binding and the transient increase in gastric pH was evaluated in human DDI studies using two drugs with the most binding to veverimer (furosemide, aspirin) and two additional drugs with pH-dependent solubility effecting absorption (dabigatran, warfarin). None of the four drugs showed clinically meaningful DDI with veverimer in human studies. Based on the physicochemical characteristics of veverimer and results from in vitro and human studies, veverimer is unlikely to have significant DDIs. SIGNIFICANCE STATEMENT: Patients with chronic kidney disease, who are usually on many drugs, are vulnerable to drug-drug interactions (DDIs). The potential for DDIs with veverimer was evaluated based on the known site of action and physicochemical structure of the polymer, which restricts the compound to the gastrointestinal tract. Based on the findings from in vitro and human studies, we conclude that veverimer is unlikely to have clinically significant DDIs.",

        "Abstract":"IMPORTANCE: Anticipating the risk of gastrointestinal bleeding (GIB) when initiating antithrombotic treatment (oral antiplatelets or anticoagulants) is limited by existing risk prediction models. Machine learning algorithms may result in superior predictive models to aid in clinical decision-making.\nOBJECTIVE: To compare the performance of 3 machine learning approaches with the commonly used HAS-BLED (hypertension, abnormal kidney and liver function, stroke, bleeding, labile international normalized ratio, older age, and drug or alcohol use) risk score in predicting antithrombotic-related GIB.\nDESIGN, SETTING, AND PARTICIPANTS: This retrospective cross-sectional study used data from the OptumLabs Data Warehouse, which contains medical and pharmacy claims on privately insured patients and Medicare Advantage enrollees in the US. The study cohort included patients 18 years or older with a history of atrial fibrillation, ischemic heart disease, or venous thromboembolism who were prescribed oral anticoagulant and\/or thienopyridine antiplatelet agents between January 1, 2016, and December 31, 2019.\nEXPOSURES: A cohort of patients prescribed oral anticoagulant and thienopyridine antiplatelet agents was divided into development and validation cohorts based on date of index prescription. The development cohort was used to train 3 machine learning models to predict GIB at 6 and 12 months: regularized Cox proportional hazards regression (RegCox), random survival forests (RSF), and extreme gradient boosting (XGBoost).\nMAIN OUTCOMES AND MEASURES: The performance of the models for predicting GIB in the validation cohort, evaluated using the area under the receiver operating characteristic curve (AUC), sensitivity, specificity, positive predictive value, and prediction density plots. Relative importance scores were used to identify the variables that were most influential in the top-performing machine learning model.\nRESULTS: In the entire study cohort of 306 463 patients, 166 177 (54.2%) were male, 193 648 (63.2%) were White, the mean (SD) age was 69.0 (12.6) years, and 12 322 (4.0%) had experienced a GIB. In the validation data set, the HAS-BLED model had an AUC of 0.60 for predicting GIB at 6 months and 0.59 at 12 months. The RegCox model performed the best in the validation set, with an AUC of 0.67 at 6 months and 0.66 at 12 months. XGBoost was similar, with AUCs of 0.67 at 6 months and 0.66 at 12 months, whereas for RSF, AUCs were 0.62 at 6 months and 0.60 at 12 months. The variables with the highest importance scores in the RegCox model were prior GI bleed (importance score, 0.72); atrial fibrillation, ischemic heart disease, and venous thromboembolism combined (importance score, 0.38); and use of gastroprotective agents (importance score, 0.32).\nCONCLUSIONS AND RELEVANCE: In this cross-sectional study, the machine learning models examined showed similar performance in identifying patients at high risk for GIB after being prescribed antithrombotic agents. Two models (RegCox and XGBoost) performed modestly better than the HAS-BLED score. A prospective evaluation of the RegCox model compared with HAS-BLED may provide a better understanding of the clinical impact of improved performance.",

The patient group was divided into two groups as per the surgical technique (ie, open vs. robot-assisted). Demographic data, preoperative and postoperative data of all patients were collected prospectively. The QoL of the patients was assessed preoperatively and on the postoperative 30th day.\nRESULTS: Sixty-seven patients who underwent OKT and 60 patients who underwent RAKT were included. The mean patient age and BMI were calculated as 40.9 ± 11.6 years and 24.4 ± 2.9 kg\/m , respectively. Patients in the RAKT group were significantly younger than the patients in the OKT group (P = .002). There were no significant differences between the two groups in terms of gender, BMI, ASA and the ratio of premptive patients. The mean preoperative hemoglobin level was significantly higher in the OKT group than the RAKT group (P = .003).

Consecutive inpatients with acute STEMI and left ventricular aneurysm, hospitalized from January 2014 to June 2020 in the First Affiliated Hospital of Zhengzhou University, were enrolled in this retrospective study. Patients were divided into LVT group and non-LVT group according to the presence or absence of LVT. The clinical data, echocardiography findings, coronary angiography and treatments were compared between the two groups. Subgroup analysis was performed on the patients receiving primary percutaneous coronary intervention (PCI). Onset to door, door to balloon, onset to balloon time were also compared. Multivariate logistic regression was used to analyze the related factors of LVT formation early post STEMI in enrolled patients. The effects of each index in multivariate logistic regression analysis were illustrated in the forest plot.

History of angina (=0.159, 95% 0.058-0.441, <0.001), collateral circulation of the coronary arteries (=0.189, 95% 0.053-0.673, =0.010), primary PCI or venous thrombolysis (=0.252, 95% 0.093-0.682, =0.007) were negatively correlated with LVT in patients with acute STEMI and LVA.  History of heavy drinking, anemia, LVEF ≤40%, preoperative TIMI blood flow grade 0 are associated with increased risk of the LVT in patients with acute STEMI and LVA at early stage of the disease. However, history of angina, collateral circulation of the coronary arteries, primary PCI or venous thrombolysis are associated with lower risk of the LVT in these patients.",

        "Abstract":"BACKGROUND: Percutaneous nephrolithotomy (PCNL) a minimally invasive method for the removal of renal calculi and is associated with significant pain in postoperative period. Conventionally, intravenous opioids, local anesthetic infiltration, and regional blocks (intercostal\/paravertebral blocks) have been tried with less efficacy to control postoperative pain. The present study is conducted to assess the effectiveness of erector spinae plane block (ESPB) performed under fluoroscopy guidance for postoperative analgesia during PCNL.\nSUBJECTS AND METHODS: After obtaining ethical clearance, the study was conducted on 61 American Society of Anaesthesiologists (ASA) I and II patients aged between 18-65 years admitted for PCNL. Group I ( = 30) did not receive ESPB while Group II ( = 31) received ESPB under fluoroscopy guidance and 20 ml of 0.375% ropivacaine was administered after PCNL. Patient-reported pain intensity using visual analogue scale (VAS) was considered as a primary outcome. The hemodynamic variables (heart rate, systolic, diastolic, and mean blood pressure) was considered as a secondary outcome. Statistical analysis was performed using Student's -test and Mann-Whitney U test. Data analysis was performed using the Statistical Package for the Social Sciences version 23.0.\nRESULTS: Postoperatively VAS score was significantly lower in Group II at 0, 1, 2, 3, 4, 6, 12, 18, and 24 hours after PCNL ( < 0.001). Dose of rescue analgesia significantly decreased in Group II compared to Group I.\nCONCLUSION: ESPB performed under fluoroscopic guidance is a simple and effective technique and it provides significantly better postoperative pain relief.",

We examined 146 patients attending our hospital from January 2012 to December 2019. The octogenarian group included 48 patients and the control group (younger patients) 98 patients. The median body mass index (BMI) (21.2 vs 23.4 kg\/m^2, p<0.001), American Society of Anesthesiologists (ASA) score (p=0.044), preoperative albumin concentration (p=0.04) and operation time (287 vs 314 min, p=0.029) differed significantly between the two groups. However, there were no significant differences in perioperative complications between the two groups. According to multivariable analysis of overall survival, pT3 or higher pathology was a significant indicator of poor prognosis in all patients. In the octogenarian group alone, perioperative transfusion was the only other factor significantly associated with prognosis, whereas anti-CD55 monoclonal antibody (RM1) was a significant factor in the control group. There were significant differences between the octogenarian and control groups with respect to overall survival in those with pT2 or below stage disease (60.2% vs 87.5%, p=0.049), but not to cancer-specific survival (≤pT2 : 73.5% vs 94.2%, p=0.202 ≥pT3 : 72.2% vs 63.8%, p=0. 87).

        "Abstract":"INTRODUCTION: Patients with bilateral kidney stones and burdened by large stones are challenging cases for endourologists. Simultaneous bilateral percutaneous nephrolithotomy (sbPCNL) is an option; however, it may be accompanied by important morbidity. An alternative is a staged PCNL, operating one side each time. Herein, we compare the impact of sbPCNL and staged PCNL on complication rates and renal function.\nMETHODS: Patients who underwent sbPCNL or staged bilateral PCNL with a frame time of 6 months were searched in our prospectively collected kidney stone database. Groups were compared for age, gender, body mass index (BMI), comorbidities (classification by the American Society of Anesthesiology - ASA), stone size, Guy's score, stone-free status, renal function, blood loss, blood transfusion rate, complication rate, and length of hospital stay.\nRESULTS: Twenty-six patients and 52 kidney units were enrolled. The mean operative time was 134.7 min. Only 11.3% of cases had complications, all of them minor (Clavien ≤ 2). Overall, the stone-free rate was 61.50%. Comparing the groups, there was a significantly longer operative time in the sbPCNL group (172.5 vs. 126.3 min; p=0.016), as well as a higher transfusion rate (12.5% vs. 5.6%; p=0.036). There was no statistically significant difference in creatinine levels between the groups. Regarding the stone-free rate, there was a significantly higher proportion of patients in the staged PCNL group (64.9% vs. 43.8%; p=0.012).\nCONCLUSION: sbPCNL is a safe procedure; however, when compared to staged procedures it has a higher transfusion and lower stone-free rate.",

        "Abstract":"The risks of stroke and dementia increase steeply with age, and both are preventable. At present, the best way to preserve cognitive function is to prevent stroke. Therapeutic nihilism based on age is common and unwarranted. We address recent advances in stroke prevention that could contribute greatly to prevention of stroke and dementia at a time when the aging of the population threatens to markedly increase the incidence of both. Issues discussed: (1) old patients benefit even more from lipid-lowering therapy than do younger patients; (2) patients with stiff arteries are at risk from a target systolic blood pressure <120 mm Hg; (3) the interaction of the intestinal microbiome, age, and renal function has important dietary implications for older adults; (4) anticoagulation with direct-acting oral anticoagulants should be prescribed more to old patients with atrial fibrillation; (5) B vitamins to lower homocysteine prevent stroke; and (6) most old patients in whom intervention is warranted for carotid stenosis would benefit more from endarterectomy than from stenting. An 80-year-old person has much to lose from a stroke and should not have effective therapy withheld on account of age. Lipid-lowering therapy, a more plant-based diet, appropriate anticoagulation or antiplatelet therapy, appropriate blood pressure control, B vitamins to lower homocysteine, and judicious intervention for carotid stenosis could do much to reduce the growing burden of stroke and dementia.",

In this study, we presented three male adolescents with MIS and myocardial injury admitted to the hospital during the peak of COVID-19 pandemic. All of the three patients had a history of fever, gastrointestinal symptoms, polymorph rash, non-exudative  onjunctivitis, and signs of acute myocarditis (AM). One of them had renal failure. Previously, they did not have an acute infection. Upon admission, they were hypotensive and tachycardic. A nasopharyngeal swab for severe acute respiratory syndrome coronavirus 2 (SARS-CoV-2) on reverse transcription-polymerase chain reaction (PCR) assay was negative, but neutralizing viral antibodies were positive. In combination with blood tests,  lectrocardiogram, echocardiography, and computerized tomography, a MIS associated with acute myocarditis with mild to moderate systolic dysfunction and dilated coronary arteries were diagnosed. Two of three patients had shock syndrome andrequired inotropic support. All patients were treated with intravenous imunoglobulins (Ig). The second patient had a fever up to 102.2°F (39°C) 3 days after intravenous Ig. Further, he was treated according to protocols for refractory Kawasaki disease, with an intravenous methylprednisolone pulse therapy and aspirin. After a few hours, he became afebrile and the clinical signs disappeared.

        "Abstract":"Eighty primary renal allograft recipients, 61 living-related and 19 deceased donor, transplanted from 1963 through 1984 had continuous graft function for 30-47 years. They were treated with three different early immunosuppression programs (1963-1970: thymectomy, splenectomy, high oral prednisone; 1971-1979: divided-dose intravenous methylprednisolone; and 1980-1984: antilymphocyte globulin) each with maintenance prednisone and azathioprine, and no calcineurin inhibitor. Long-term treatment often included the anti-platelet medication, dipyridamole. Although both recipient and donor ages were young (27.2 ± 9.5 and 33.1 ± 12.0 years, respectively), six recipients with a parent donor had >40-year success. At 35 years, death-censored graft survival was 85.3% and death with a functioning graft 84.2%; overall graft survival was 69.5% (Kaplan-Meier estimate). Biopsy-documented early acute cellular and highly probable antibody-mediated rejections were reversed with divided-dose intravenous methylprednisolone. Complications are detailed in an integrated timeline. Hypogammaglobulinemia identified after 20 years doubled the infection rate. An association between a monoclonal gammopathy of undetermined significance and non-plasma-cell malignancies was identified. Twenty-seven azathioprine-treated patients tested after 37 years had extremely low levels of T1\/T2 B lymphocytes representing a \"low immunosuppression state of allograft acceptance (LISAA)\". The lifetime achievements of these patients following a single renal allograft and low-dose maintenance immunosuppression are remarkable. Their success evolved as a clinical mosaic.",

We compared the efficacy and safety of percutaneous nephrolithotomy (PCNL) performed under regional anesthesia between elderly patients (age >65 years) and patients aged <65 years.\nMATERIALS AND METHODS: Between July 2015 and June 2016, fifty patients aged >65 years with renal stones (size >1.5 cm) were treated with PCNL under regional anesthesia (elderly group). We retrospectively compared the outcomes with those obtained in an equal number of patients aged <65 years (younger group) who underwent PCNL under regional anesthesia. Patients with staghorn stones and pyonephrosis and falling under the American Society of Anesthesiologists (ASA) Grade IV were excluded. Data pertaining to demographic characteristics, body mass index, stone bulk, operative time, tract size, number of tracts required, blood loss, clearance rates, complications, and length of hospital stay were analyzed.\nRESULTS: The mean age at presentation in the elderly and younger groups was 66.8 ± 2.1 years and 38.7 ± 11 years, respectively; 56% of the patients in the elderly age group had ASA Grade II, whereas 58% in the younger age group had ASA Grade I. The mean stone size and the number of tracts were comparable in both the groups, whereas operative time was slightly longer in the elderly group (58.54 ± 18 vs. 51.98 ± 18 min;  < 0.05). Postoperative complications and stone-free rates (94% vs. 92%, respectively) were comparable in the two groups.\nCONCLUSIONS: Age itself should not deter the treatment of elderly patients with renal stones as PCNL under regional anesthesia is safe and effective in elderly patients; outcomes in elderly and younger patients were comparable in this study.",

We undertook the present study to investigate the frequency of morbidity and mortality related to CVD, as well as to cerebrovascular and kidney disease, among patients with TAK in the UK.\nMETHODS: Yearly cohort and cross-sectional studies were performed from 2000 to 2017 to estimate annual incidence and prevalence, respectively, of TAK. Using a UK primary care database (IQVIA Medical Research Data), an open retrospective matched cohort study was conducted to estimate risk of hypertension, diabetes, cardiovascular morbidity, chronic kidney disease (CKD), and all-cause mortality in TAK. Risk (adjusted hazard ratio [HR]) of the assessed comorbidities among patients with TAK compared to age- and sex-matched controls was estimated. Changes in medication prescription over time were examined in both groups.\nRESULTS: One hundred forty-two patients with TAK (median age 53.4 years [interquartile range 33.8-70.7]) and 1,371 matched controls were included. The annual incidence and prevalence of TAK were 0.8 per million and 7.5 per million respectively. All-cause mortality was increased in TAK (adjusted HR 1.88 [95% confidence interval 1.29-2.76]). Patients with TAK had an increased risk of developing ischemic heart disease, stroke\/transient ischemic attack, combined CVD, and peripheral vascular disease compared to controls, but no increase in risk of hypertension, CKD, heart failure, or diabetes. Only ~50% of patients with TAK requiring secondary CVD prevention were prescribed statins or antiplatelet agents within 1 year after study entry.\nCONCLUSION: Cardiovascular morbidity was increased among patients with TAK receiving primary care services in the UK.

The objective of our study was to evaluate the eligibility and budgetary impact of the COMPASS trial in a real-world population.\nMETHODS: The VA administrative and clinical databases were utilized to conduct a cross-sectional study to identify patients eligible for low-dose rivaroxaban receiving care at all 141 facilities between October 1, 2014 and September 30, 2015. Proportion of patients with stable ASCVD eligible for low-dose rivaroxaban and prevalence of multiple risk enrichment criteria among eligible patients. Pharmaceutical budgetary impact using VA pharmacy pricing. Chi-squared and Student's t tests were used to compare patients eligible versus ineligible patients.\nRESULTS: From an initial cohort of 1,248,214 patients with ASCVD, 488,495 patients (39.1%) met trial eligibility criteria. Eligible patients were older (74.2 vs 64.5 years) with higher proportion of hypertension (84.1% vs 82.1%) and diabetes (46.2% vs 32.9) compared with ineligible patients (p < 0.001 for all comparisons). A median of 38.7% (IQR 4.6%) of total ASCVD patients per facility were rivaroxaban eligible. Estimated annual VA pharmacy budgetary impact would range from $0.47 billion to $1.88 billion for 25% to 100% treatment penetration. Annual facility level pharmaceutical budgetary impact would be a median of $12.3 million (IQR $8.0-$16.3 million) for treatment of all eligible patients. Among eligible patients, age greater than 65 years was the most common risk enrichment factor (86.9%). Prevalence of eligible patients with multiple enrichment factors varied from 34.2% (one factor) to 6.2% (four or more).\nCONCLUSION: Over one third of patients with stable ASCVD may qualify for low-dose rivaroxaban within the VA.

This study investigated national practice patterns between pediatric urologists (PU) and pediatric surgeons (PS) in pediatric renal malignancy.\nMATERIALS AND METHODS: The Pediatric National Surgical Quality Improvement Program database was queried for CPT codes for radical\/partial nephrectomy from 2012-2017 performed for renal malignancy. Patients were grouped by specialty and operative approach.\nRESULTS: PU managed 175 (17%) patients while PS managed 811 (77%). PU were more likely to use MIS (14% versus 5%, p < 0.001) and NSS (33% versus 13%, p < 0.001) compared to PS. PS more commonly performed lymph node (LN) sampling\/tumor thrombectomy, especially in MIS cases (67% versus 35%, p = 0.008). PS operated on younger patients with higher ASA class compared to PU, but had higher transfusion rates and longer length of stay. Central venous access surgery was more commonly performed on patients operated on by PS, while PU performed more cystoscopy\/retrograde pyelography. Patients who underwent NSS compared to radical nephrectomy were less likely to undergo LN sampling, while LN sampling did not differ between open and MIS groups.\nCONCLUSIONS: PU were likely to perform MIS and NSS than PS for pediatric renal masses in this national database. This likely results from inherent training differences between PS and PU and reflects emerging data on safety and efficacy of these advanced surgical techniques. Further investigation into the impact on oncologic and clinical outcomes by surgical specialty and operative approach is necessary.",

        "Abstract":"OBJECTIVE: There is a lack of robust data on significant gastrointestinal bleeding in older people using aspirin. We calculated the incidence, risk factors and absolute risk using data from a large randomised, controlled trial.\nDESIGN: Data were extracted from an aspirin versus placebo primary prevention trial conducted throughout 2010-2017 ('ASPirin in Reducing Events in the Elderly (ASPREE)', n=19 114) in community-dwelling persons aged ≥70 years. Clinical characteristics were collected at baseline and annually. The endpoint was major GI bleeding that resulted in transfusion, hospitalisation, surgery or death, adjudicated independently by two physicians blinded to trial arm.\nRESULTS: Over a median follow-up of 4.7 years (88 389 person years), there were 137 upper GI bleeds (89 in aspirin arm and 48 in placebo arm, HR 1.87, 95% CI 1.32 to 2.66, p<0.01) and 127 lower GI bleeds (73 in aspirin and 54 in placebo arm, HR 1.36, 95% CI 0.96 to 1.94, p=0.08) reflecting a 60% increase in bleeding overall. There were two fatal bleeds in the placebo arm. Multivariable analyses indicated age, smoking, hypertension, chronic kidney disease and obesity increased bleeding risk. The absolute 5-year risk of bleeding was 0.25% (95% CI 0.16% to 0.37%) for a 70 year old not on aspirin and up to 5.03% (2.56% to 8.73%) for an 80 year old taking aspirin with additional risk factors.\nCONCLUSION: Aspirin increases overall GI bleeding risk by 60%; however, the 5-year absolute risk of serious bleeding is modest in younger, well individuals. These data may assist patients and their clinicians to make informed decisions about prophylactic use of aspirin.\nTRIAL REGISTRATION NUMBER: ASPREE. NCT01038583.",

        "Abstract":"BACKGROUND: Acute kidney injury (AKI) has been well documented in adults after noncardiac surgery and demonstrated to be associated with adverse outcomes. We report the prevalence of AKI after pediatric noncardiac surgery, the perioperative factors associated with postoperative AKI, and the association of AKI with postoperative outcomes in children undergoing noncardiac surgery.\nMETHODS: Patients ≤18 years of age who underwent noncardiac surgery with serum creatinine during the 12 months preceding surgery and no history of end-stage renal disease were included in this retrospective observational study at a single tertiary academic hospital. Patients were evaluated during the first 7 days after surgery for development of any stage of AKI, according to Kidney Disease: Improving Global Outcomes (KDIGO) criteria. Patients were classified into stages of KDIGO AKI for the purposes of describing prevalence. For further analyses, patients were grouped into those who developed any stage of AKI postoperatively and those who did not. Additionally, the time point at which each patient was first diagnosed with stage I AKI or greater was also assessed. Pre-, intra-, and postoperative factors were compared between the 2 groups. A multivariable Cox proportional hazards regression model was created to examine the time to first diagnosis of AKI using all nonredundant covariates. Analysis of the association of AKI with postoperative outcomes, mortality and 30-day readmission, was undertaken utilizing propensity score-matched controls and a multivariable Cox proportional hazards regression model.\nRESULTS: A total of 25,203 cases between 2013 and 2018 occurred; 8924 met inclusion criteria. Among this cohort, the observed prevalence of postoperative AKI was 3.2% (288 cases; confidence interval [CI], 2.9-3.6). The multivariable Cox model showed American Society of Anesthesiologists (ASA) status to be associated with the development of postoperative AKI. Several other factors, including intraoperative hypotension, were significantly associated with postoperative AKI in univariable models but found not to be significantly associated after adjustment. The multivariable Cox analyses with propensity-matched controls showed an estimated hazard ratio of 3.28 for mortality (CI, 1.71-6.32, P < .001) and 1.55 for 30-day readmission (CI, 1.08-2.23, P = .018) in children who developed AKI versus those who did not.\nCONCLUSIONS: In children undergoing noncardiac surgery, postoperative AKI occurred in 3.2% of patients. Several factors, including intraoperative hypotension, were significantly associated with postoperative AKI in univariable models. After adjustment, only ASA status was found to be significantly associated with AKI in children after noncardiac surgery. Postoperative AKI was found to be associated with significantly higher rates of mortality and 30-day readmission in multivariable, time-varying models with propensity-matched controls.",

Randomisation stratified by 4 factors: 1) Gender (M\/F); 2) Age (<75\/≥75 years); 3) BMI (<30\/≥30); 4) Comorbidities (0-1\/>2) with random variable block sizes will be generated by STATA software. The web-based system will guarantee the allocation concealment. Blinding (masking) The study is conceived as open-label: patients and all health-care personnel involved in the study will be aware of the assigned group.\nNUMBERS TO BE RANDOMISED (SAMPLE SIZE): The target sample size is based on the hypothesis that LMWH administered at high doses versus low doses will significantly reduce the risk of clinical worsening. The overall sample size in this study is expected to be 300 with 150 in the Low-Dose LMWH control group and 150 in the High-Dose LMWH intervention group, recruited over 10-11 months. Assuming an alpha of 5% (two tailed) and a percentage of patients who experience clinical worsening in the control group being between 25% and 30%, the study will have 80% power to detect at least 50% relative reduction in the risk of death between low and high doses of heparin.\nTRIAL STATUS: Protocol version 1.2 of 11\/05\/2020.

RIRS was performed. Demographics, clinical data, and complications were recorded and compared.\nRESULTS: Mean age of 78 patients was 52.47 ±13.28 years. There were no significant difference in gender, American Society of Anesthesiology (ASA) scores, operation time, number of multiple sessions, success rates of outcome and complication rates between groups. At the end of the first session, stone-free rates were 91.1% vs 87.9% in younger and elderly groups, respectively; while, after the second session, all patients were stone-free in both groups. Fever, hematuria (macroscopic, more than 24 hours), and perirenal hematoma were the observed complications. Postoperative hematocrit levels significantly decreased without any need of transfusion; there were significant differences in the preoperative and postoperative creatinine levels ( p=0.002) in the older group.\nCONCLUSION: RIRS is a safe and effective method for treating kidney stones up to 3 centimeter diameter in all age groups. Although hemorrhagic events are mostly clinically unremarkable, there is a risk of renal function impairment in older (≥60 years) patients. Preoperative hydration and postoperative close follow-up is important. Key Words: Retrograde ıntrarenal surgery, Elderly, Effectiveness, Safety.",

        "Abstract":"Chronic kidney disease (CKD) is associated with an increased risk of acute coronary syndrome (ACS) and cardiovascular death. CKD patients suffering from ACS are exposed to an increased risk of thrombotic recurrences and a higher bleeding rate than patients with normal renal function. However, CKD patients are excluded or underrepresented in clinical trials. Therefore, determining the optimal antiplatelet strategy in this population is of utmost importance. We designed the TicagRelor Or Clopidogrel in severe or terminal chronic kidney patients Undergoing PERcutaneous coronary intervention for acute coronary syndrome (TROUPER) trial: a prospective, controlled, multicenter, randomized trial to investigate the optimal P2Y12 antagonist in CKD patients with ACS. Patients with stage ≥3b CKD are eligible if the diagnosis of ACS is made and invasive strategy scheduled. Patients are randomized 1:1 between a control group with a 600-mg loading dose of clopidogrel followed by a 75-mg\/d maintenance dose for 1 year and an experimental group with a 180-mg loading dose of ticagrelor followed by a 90-mg twice daily maintenance dose for the same duration. The primary end point is defined by the rate of major adverse cardiovascular events, including death, myocardial infarction, urgent revascularization, and stroke at 1 year. Safety will be evaluated by the bleeding rate (Bleeding Academic Research Consortium). To demonstrate the superiority of ticagrelor on major adverse cardiovascular events, we calculated that 508 patients are required. The aim of the TROUPER trial is to compare the efficacy of ticagrelor and clopidogrel in stage >3b CKD patients presenting with ACS and scheduled for an invasive strategy. RCT# NCT03357874.",

A total of 1263 consecutive patients were enrolled in the prospective, observational, single-arm registry and divided into 2 groups according to age: ≥80 years (290, 22.9%) and <80 years (973, 77.1%). Baseline patient characteristics, risk scores according to the Society for Vascular Surgery (SVS) reporting standards, American Society of Anesthesiologists (ASA) classification, quality of life assessments [EuroQol 5 (EQ5D) index], and treatment outcomes, including all-cause mortality, aneurysm-related mortality, major adverse events, secondary endovascular procedures, and endoleaks were compared between groups.\nRESULTS: Octogenarians were classified into the highest category of the SVS risk stratification system; however, this did not result in a significant difference in the 30-day mortality [1.4% (4\/290) vs 1.2% (12\/973) for controls; p=0.85] or major adverse event rates [5.2% (15\/290) vs 3.6% (35\/973), p=0.23]. Multivariable analysis confirmed that age ≥80 years, pulmonary disease, large aneurysm diameter, and renal insufficiency were significantly associated with all-cause mortality, whereas diameter was the only parameter associated with increased aneurysm-related mortality. The differences in freedom from secondary endovascular procedures over 5 years between octogenarians and controls did not reach statistical significance (88.5% vs 83.2%, p=0.07).\nCONCLUSION: EVAR can be performed in individuals aged ≥80 years with no statistically significant difference in midterm aneurysm-related deaths compared with younger patients.

We performed a retrospective review using electronic medical records of St. Marianna University School of Medicine Hospital (a 1200-bed teaching hospital in Japan) to address the prevalence of IRDs and patient-related factors that result in IRDs. We also surveyed DOAC-treated patients who were hospitalized due to a stroke during the 5-year study period to analyze the association between stroke events and IRDs. We found that one in five patients who were newly prescribed a DOAC was treated with IRDs. Patients treated with edoxaban received the most IRDs (64%, 7\/11), followed by those treated with dabigatran (50%, 1\/2), apixaban (32%, 19\/61), and rivaroxaban (27%, 12\/44). Our analysis showed that the renal function (measured as serum creatinine and creatinine clearance values) and age are possible factors influencing dose reduction. The HAS-BLED score and antiplatelet use were not associated with IRD prescription. An analysis of the 5-year hospital records revealed 20 stroke cases despite ongoing treatments with DOACs, and IRDs were noted in three of these cases. In all three cases, the patients had been on an IRD of rivaroxaban. To prevent IRDs of DOACs, we suggest that a clinical protocol be incorporated into formularies to support the prescription process.",

We summarized sex-specific data using mean differences (MDs) and relative risks (RRs) and pooled estimates using random effects meta-analysis. There were fewer women than men in included trials (28.5-35.8% women). Women more often had stroke (RR 1.28; 95% CI 1.09, 1.50), heart failure (RR 1.30; 95% CI 1.21,1.40), and chronic kidney disease (RR 1.33; 95% CI 1.17; 1.51). They less often used statins (RR 0.90; 95% CI 0.86, 0.93), aspirin (RR 0.82; 95% CI 0.71, 0.95), and β-blockers (RR 0.93; 95% CI 0.88, 0.97) and had a higher systolic blood pressure (MD 1.66 mmHg; 95% CI 0.90, 2.41), LDL cholesterol (MD 0.34 mmol\/L; 95% CI 0.29, 0.39), and hemoglobin A (MD 0.11%; 95% CI 0.09, 0.14 [1.2 mmol\/mol; 1.0, 1.5]) than men.\nLIMITATIONS: We could not carry out subgroup analyses due to the small number of studies. Our study is not generalizable to low CV risk groups nor to patients in routine care.\nCONCLUSIONS: There were baseline sex disparities in diabetes CVOTs. We suggest efforts to recruit women into trials and promote CV management across the sexes.",

The objectives of the study were to examine the temporal trends and patient characteristics associated with prescription of thrombolytic, antithrombotic and statin medications among patients with first-ever stroke.\nMATERIALS AND METHODS: First-ever ischaemic and haemorrhagic stroke patients admitted to 2 Singapore tertiary hospitals between 2010‒2014 were included. Data were extracted from the National Healthcare Group Chronic Disease Management System. Association between drug utilisation and admission year, as well as characteristics associated with drug use, were explored using multivariable logistic regression.\nRESULTS: There was an increasing trend in the combined use of all 3 guideline medications in ischaemic stroke patients ( <0.001)-specifically thrombolytic agents ( <0.001), oral antithrombotics ( = 0.002) and statins ( = 0.003) at discharge. Among antithrombotics, the use of clopidogrel ( <0.001) and aspirin-clopidogrel ( <0.001) had increased, whereas prescription of dipyridamole ( <0.001) and aspirin-dipyridamole ( <0.001) had declined. For statins, the increase in atorvastatin prescription ( <0.001) was accompanied by decreasing use of simvastatin ( <0.001). Age, ethnicity and certain comorbidities (hyperlipidaemia, atrial fibrillation and chronic kidney disease) were associated with the combined use of all 3 guideline medications ( <0.05). In haemorrhagic stroke, prescription of statins at discharge were comparatively lower.\nCONCLUSION: This study reveals changes in prescription behaviour over time in a multiethnic Asian population with first-ever stroke. Patient characteristics including younger age, Malay ethnicity and certain comorbidities (i.e. hyperlipidaemia, atrial fibrillation) were associated with the combined use of all 3 guideline medications among ischaemic stroke patients.",

The aim of this study was to compare the incidence and magnitude of hemodynamic changes in preeclamptic and non-preeclamptic parturients undergone Cesarean section under spinal anesthesia.\nMETHOD: A prospective cohort study was conducted from 01 February to 28 May 2019 in preeclamptic and non-preeclamptic parturients. We hypothesized preeclamptic parturients are at high risk of spinal anesthesia induced hypotension than non preeclamptics. A total of 122 ASA II and ASA III parturients were recruited consecutively and assigned to two groups (81non-preeclamptics, and 41 preeclamptics). Parturients with cardiac disease, twin pregnancy, chronic hypertension, gestational hypertension, superimposed hypertension, renal disease, diabetes mellitus, coagulopathy (platelet count < 80 × 10\/L), active labor, eclampsia, abruptio placentae, placenta praevia, any adjuvant added with local anesthetics were excluded. The data analysis was done using SPSS version 22 statistical software. Student t test, MannWhitney U test and Fisher exact test were used to compare the data. All  values < 0.05 were considered statistically significant.\nRESULT: The incidence of spinal anesthesia-induced hypotension was higher in non-preeclamptic parturients than preeclamptic parturients (55.6% vs. 34.1%, respectively) and the degree of blood pressure drop was significantly greater in the non-preeclamptic parturients compared to those with preeclampsia; As well intraoperative fluid consumption was significantly greater in the non-preeclamptics parturients compared to those with preeclamptics.\nCONCLUSION: The incidence and magnitude of spinal anesthesia-induced hypotension in parturients undergone Cesarean section were less in preeclamptic parturients than in non-preeclamptic parturients.. Based on the data from this study we recommended spinal anesthesia for preeclamptic patients, unless there is a contra indication based on preeclampsia.",

        "Abstract":"INTRODUCTION: Partial nephrectomy (NP) after embolization of tumor vessels (NPESH) in a hybrid room combines embolization of tumor vessels and enucleation of the tumor under laparoscopy in the same operative time. The purpose of this study was to assess the impact of the use of NPESH in the management of patients treated with surgery for a localized kidney tumor.\nMATERIAL AND METHODS: Using the uroCCR database, we included all consecutive patients operated in a university hospital for localized kidney tumor. From 2011 to May 2015, patients were treated by Standard Partial Nephrectomy (NPS) Laparoscopic or Open and from May 2015 to May 2019 by NPESH. We evaluated characteristics of patients, tumors, perioperative data and complications. These data were compared by Student and Khi2 tests.\nRESULTS: 87 NPS were performed during Period 1 and 137 NPS were performed during period 2. The ASA score of patients undergoing NPESH was higher than NPS (P<0.0001). The tumor complexity and median tumor size were similar in the two groups (P=0.852 and P=0.48). The complication rate for NPS and NPESH was 55.2% and 33.6% (P=0.002). There were less severe complications in the NEPSH group (P=0.012). The median length of stay was 8 and 4 days for the NPS and NPESH groups (P<0.0001). Positive surgical margins were 2 (2.3%) and 6 (4.6%) for the NPS and NPESH group (P=0.713).\nDISCUSSION: NPESH is an efficient technique compared to NPS. It seems to be an interesting alternative to limit renal ischemia, complication rate and length of stay for the management of localized kidney tumors.",

        "Published":null,
        "Abstract":"OBJECTIVES: Shunt thrombosis, a potential complication of aortopulmonary shunting, is associated with high mortality. Commonly used oral antiplatelet drugs such as aspirin demonstrate variable absorption and inconsistent antiplatelet effect in critically ill patients early after surgery. IV glycoprotein IIb\/IIIa inhibitors are antiplatelet agents with rapid and reproducible effect that may be beneficial as a bridge to oral therapy.\nDESIGN: Retrospective review of pediatric patients undergoing treatment with IV tirofiban. Discarded blood samples were used to determine pharmacokinetic parameters.\nSETTING: Pediatric cardiac ICU at a single institution.\nPATIENTS: Fifty-two pediatric patients (< 18 yr) undergoing surgical aortopulmonary shunt procedure who received tirofiban infusion as a bridge to oral aspirin.\nINTERVENTIONS: None.\nMEASUREMENTS AND MAIN RESULTS: Primary outcome measures were shunt thrombosis and bleeding events, whereas secondary outcomes included measurement of platelet inhibition by thromboelastography with platelet mapping and pharmacokinetic analysis (performed in a subset of 15 patients). Shunt thrombosis occurred in two of 52 patients (3.9%) after prophylaxis treatment with tirofiban; both thrombosis events occurred after discontinuation of the drug. One patient (1.9%) experienced bleeding complication during the infusion. A tirofiban bolus of 10 µg\/kg and infusion of 0.15 µg\/kg\/min resulted in significantly increased platelet inhibition via adenosine diphosphate pathway (median 66% [43-96] pre-tirofiban compared with 97% [92-99%] at 2 hr; p < 0.05). Half-life of tirofiban in plasma was 142 ± 1.5 minutes, and the average steady-state concentration was 112 ± 62 ng\/mL. Age and serum creatinine were significant covariates associated with systemic clearance. Dosing simulations were generated based upon one compartment model.\nCONCLUSIONS: IV glycoprotein IIb\/IIIa inhibitor as a bridge to oral antiplatelet therapy is safe in pediatric patients after aortopulmonary shunting. Dosing considerations should include both age and renal function. Randomized trials are warranted to establish efficacy compared with current anticoagulation practices.",

One-year major adverse cardiac events (MACE) were defined as a composite of death, myocardial infarction (MI), or target vessel revascularization. Outcomes were adjusted using multivariable Cox regression methods.\nRESULTS: During the study period, 16,889 patients underwent PCI including 13.7% ITDM, 34.0% non-ITDM, and 52.3% non-DM patients. Patients with DM were younger, including more females and non-white patients, with higher body mass index and greater prevalence of prior revascularization and chronic kidney disease. Compared to others, ITDM patients more often presented with acute coronary syndrome, in-stent restenosis, or severe lesion calcification. There were no differences in discharge rates of dual antiplatelet therapy and statins, whereas beta-blockers were more commonly prescribed in DM patients. At 1-year, both ITDM and non-ITDM patients had greater risk of MACE compared with non-DM patients, and ITDM conferred greater adjusted risk than non-ITDM (ITDM = HR: 2.11, 95% CI [1.79,2.50]; non-ITDM = HR: 1.27, 95%CI [1.09,1.47]).\nCONCLUSIONS: The negative prognostic effect of DM following contemporary PCI is heightened in the presence of insulin treatment, compared to non-DM patients.

There were no differences in bleeding between anticoagulant groups versus control, or DOAC versus warfarin. There were no differences in blood product use between DOAC and warfarin patients. The duration of DOAC discontinuation but not the creatinine clearance influenced bleeding and blood products use.

Percutaneous coronary intervention in the cirrhotic population also has inherent risks; however, quantifiable data on long-term outcomes are lacking.\nMETHODS: Patients with angiographically significant CAD and cirrhosis were identified from the catheterization lab databases of the University of Pennsylvania Health System between 2007 and 2015. Outcomes were obtained from the medical record and telephonic contact with patients\/families.\nRESULTS: Percutaneous coronary intervention was successfully performed in 42 patients (51 PCIs). Twenty-nine patients with significant CAD were managed medically (36 angiograms). The primary outcome (a composite of mortality, subsequent revascularization, and myocardial infarction) was not significantly different between the 2 groups during a follow-up period at 1 year (PCI: 50%, Control: 40%,  = .383). In the PCI group, a composite adverse outcome rate that included acute kidney injury (AKI), severe bleed, and peri-procedural stroke was elevated (40%), with severe bleeding occurring after 23% of PCI events and post-procedural AKI occurring after 26% of events. The medical management group had significantly fewer total matched adverse outcomes (17% vs 40% in the PCI group,  = .03), with severe bleeding occurring after 11% of events and AKI occurring after 6% of events.

Randomized control trials (RCT) and observational studies that met the inclusion and exclusion criteria were included. Two reviewers independently extracted data, and evaluated study quality using modified Jadad score for RCTs and Newcastle-Ottawa Scale for observational study. A meta-analysis was conducted in the Stata 15.0 software using the DerSimonian and Laird random-effects model.\nRESULTS: 1768 references were identified from literature searching. Four RCTs and four cohort studies that reported the cardiovascular prevention outcome of aspirin in CKD patients (38,341 participants) were included in this review. The pooled data revealed that aspirin had no significant prevention effect on cardiovascular events among CKD patients (RR = 0.96, 95% CI, 0.59-1.13).

        "Abstract":"BACKGROUND: Guidelines suggest that patients discontinue Clopidogrel at least 5 days prior to coronary artery bypass grafting (CABG). Those with acute coronary syndrome (ACS) are at high risk for myocardial infarction (MI) if not treated with dual antiplatelet therapy (DAPT). We sought to assess pre and post-operative outcomes of patients maintained on Clopidogrel and aspirin up to the time of surgery and compare them with those on aspirin alone.\nMETHODS: From the cardiac surgery database, 240 patients were retrospectively registered between January and May 2017. There were 126 patients with ACS who underwent CABG on DAPT (Clopidogrel group [CG]) and 114 patients who underwent elective CABG on aspirin alone (control). The CG received intraoperative prophylactic platelet transfusion (PPT). Demographics, comorbidities, and laboratory data were prospectively entered at the time of surgery and were subsequently retrieved for analysis. Per and postoperative findings were identified and compared between both groups.\nRESULTS: The cohort consisted of 240 patients (mean age 61 years, 81.3% were male, SD ± 9.58). Patients in the CG were younger (Median 57 vs. 63, P-value 0.001), and with male predominance (86% versus 75%, P-value 0.028). In addition, they had less prevalence for diabetes and renal failure as compared to control (P-values 0.003, and 0.005, respectively). There were no significant differences between both groups in number of vessels grafts, duration of on-pump and aortic clamp. Hematologic laboratory data had also similar baseline values. The CG had similar bleeding rate, redo surgery and in-hospital death (P-values non-significant), however more infection and total hospital stay as compared to control (p-values 0.048 and 0.001).\nCONCLUSION: Patients who are at increased risk for MI can be maintained on DAPT up to the time of CABG because surgery is safe when patients are offered PPT.",

        "Abstract":"OBJECTIVE: Carotid endarterectomy (CEA) is the gold standard to prevent a recurrent stroke in symptomatic patients with carotid stenosis. However, in the modern era, the benefit of CEA in asymptomatic octogenarian patients has come into question. This study investigates real-world outcomes of CEA in asymptomatic octogenarians.\nMETHODS: Patients who underwent CEA for asymptomatic carotid stenosis were identified in the American College of Surgeons National Surgical Quality Improvement Program CEA-targeted database from 2012 to 2017. They were stratified into two groups: octogenarians (≥80 years old) and younger patients (<80 years old). The 30-day outcomes evaluated included mortality and major morbidities such as stroke, cardiac events, pulmonary, and renal dysfunction. Multivariable logistic regression was used for data analysis.\nRESULTS: We identified 13,846 patients with asymptomatic carotid stenosis who underwent an elective CEA including 2509 octogenarians and 11,337 younger patients. Octogenarians were more likely to be female and less likely to be diabetic or smokers compared with younger patients. There was no difference in preoperative use of statins or antiplatelet therapy. Examination of 30-day outcomes revealed that octogenarians had slightly higher mortality (1.2% vs 0.5%; odds ratio, 2.1; 95% confidence interval, 1.3-3.4; P < .01), and a higher risk of return to the operating room (3.3% vs 2.3%; odds ratio, 1.4; 95% confidence interval, 1.1-1.9; P = .01). However, there was no difference between octogenarians and younger patients in adverse cardiac events or pulmonary, renal, or wound complications. Twenty-five octogenarian and 138 younger patients suffered from periprocedural stroke at a similar rate (1.0% vs 1.2%; P = .54). Stroke\/death occurred for 51 of 2509 patients (2.0%) in the older group and 184 of 11,337 patients (1.6%) in the younger group, a difference that was not significant (P = .15).\nCONCLUSIONS: The 30-day outcomes of CEA in octogenarians are comparable with those in younger patients. Although the octogenarians had slightly higher mortality than younger patients, the absolute risk of mortality was still low at 1.2%. Therefore, CEA is safe in asymptomatic carotid stenosis in octogenarians. Overall life expectancy and preoperative functional status, rather than age, should be the major determinants in the decision to operate.",

        "Abstract":"Anemia is the major complication resulting from chronic kidney disease (CKD) and also a risk factor for cardiovascular events and a poor quality of life (QoL). Diabetic kidney disease (DKD) is the major cause of CKD. Initially, insulin resistance has been reported to increase erythropoiesis, but it might be a minor issue. DKD-related anemia developed earlier and was more severe than non-DKD-related anemia based on more complicated mechanisms, including greater bleeding tendency associated with antiplatelet effect, less O2 sensing due to autonomic neuropathy or renin-angiotensin-aldosterone system inhibitor use, inhibitory effect of inflammatory cytokines, urinary loss of erythropoietin (EPO), and poor response to EPO. In DKD patients, prompt correction of anemia allows for a better cardiovascular outcome and QoL, which are similar to the promising effect of anemia correction in CKD patients. However, current evidence recommended that the avoidance of a high or normalized hemoglobin (Hb) level has been suggested in the treatment of anemia in DKD patients. Despite that EPO has a pleotropic effect on renal protection from animal studies, the renal benefit was less evident in CKD and DKD patients. Recently, the antidiabetic agent, sodium glucose cotransporter-2 inhibitors (SGLT2i), has been reported to exhibit the renal benefits due to the tubulo-glomerular feedback in addition to sugar control. It may also be due to less renal ischemic through higher EPO levels, followed by higher Hb levels. More studies are needed to clarify the link between the renal benefit of SGLT2i and EPO production.",

The demographic data, surgical outcomes, complication, hospital stay, blood loss, and survival were compared between the two groups.\nRESULTS: A total of 101 patients were included; 74 in the younger group, and 27 in the older group. Compared to the young group, lower BMI, higher anemia, higher ASA grade, and comorbidities were frequent in the elderly. The operative time, blood loss, and renal function decline were comparable between two age groups. The complication rates in the older and younger group were 22% and 12%, respectively. The survival time was shorter in older patients compared to the younger ones; hazard ratio 2.25; 95%CI 1.08-4.69, -value=0.031.\nCONCLUSION: Nephrectomy in elderly patients is safe and feasible and preoperative assessment along with diligent postoperative care may further increase survival.

        "Abstract":"BACKGROUND: The benefits and risks of antiplatelet therapy for patients with chronic kidney disease (CKD) remain controversial. We undertook a systematic review and meta-analysis to investigate the effects of antiplatelet therapy on major clinical outcomes.\nMETHODS: We systematically searched MEDLINE, Embase, and the Cochrane Library for trials published before April 2019 without language restriction. We included rrandomized controlled trials that involved adults with CKD and compared antiplatelet agents with controls.\nRESULTS: Fifty eligible trials that included at least one event were identified, providing data for 27773patients with CKD, including 4518 major cardiovascular events and 1962 all-cause deaths. Antiplatelet therapy produced a 15% (OR, 0.85; 95% CI 0.74-0.94) reduction in the odds of major cardiovascular events (P = 0.002), a 48% reduction for access failure events (OR, 0.52; 95% CI, 0.31-0.73), but had no significantly effect on all-cause death (OR, 0.87; 95% CI, 0.71-1.01) or kidney failure events (OR, 0.87; 95% CI, 0.32-1.55). Adverse events were significantly increased by antiplatelet therapy, including major (OR, 1.33; 95% CI, 1.11-1.59) or minor bleeding (OR, 1.66; 95% CI, 1.27-2.05). Among every 1000 persons with CKD treated with antiplatelet therapy for 12 months, 23 major cardiovascular events will be prevented while nine major bleeding events will occur.\nCONCLUSIONS: Major prevention with antiplatelet agents (cardiovascular events and access failure), might outweigh the risk of bleeding, and there seemed to be an overall net benefit.

        "Abstract":"BACKGROUND: Rivaroxaban is a non-vitamin K oral anticoagulant and has been approved for prevention of stroke and systemic embolism in patients with non-valvular atrial fibrillation (AF). Current labeling recommends 20 mg once a day (q.d.) as a standard dose and a reduced dose of 15 mg q.d. in patients with renal impairment.\nHYPOTHESIS: The aim of this study was to analyze the adherence to current labeling concerning initial rivaroxaban dosing and to determine whether potential lack of such adherence is medically justified.\nMETHODS: Patients with AF initiated on rivaroxaban between January 1, 2016 and January 31, 2017, were identified in the Heart Center Leipzig database. Health records were screened to identify prescribed rivaroxaban dose, presence or absence of renal impairment, patient characteristics, further dosing-relevant diagnoses and co-medication with antiplatelet drugs and non-vitamin K oral anticoagulants (NOACs).\nRESULTS: We identified a total of 378 consecutive patients. In 282 cases (74.6%), rivaroxaban was prescribed in a standard dose and in 96 (25.4%) in a reduced dose. Out of 96 patients receiving a reduced dose, 50 (52.1%) did not meet labeling criteria for dose reduction. In uni- and multivariate regression analysis, estimated glomerular filtration rate (eGFR) (odds ratio [OR] 0.34, 95% confidence interval [CI] 0.12-0.95, P = .04) was the only independent predictor of rivaroxaban underdosage.\nCONCLUSIONS: In clinical practice, rivaroxaban dosing is frequently incoherent with labeling. In this study, rivaroxaban was often administered underdosed. Potentially inappropriate dose reduction was significantly associated with eGFR, the same factor that is used as criterion for dose adjustment.",

However, transcutaneous renal biopsy (TCRB) is hampered by the antithrombotic treatment frequently prescribed for those diseases. Transjugular renal biopsy (TJRB) offers an attractive alternative for patients at increased risk of bleeding. The primary objective of the study was to describe the safety profile and diagnostic performance of TJRB in SLE and APS patients.\nMETHODS: All SLE and\/or APS patients who underwent a renal biopsy in our department (between January 2004 and October 2016) were retrospectively reviewed. Major complications were death, haemostasis nephrectomy, renal artery embolization, red blood cell transfusion, sepsis and vascular thrombosis; macroscopic haematuria, symptomatic perirenal\/retroperitoneal bleeding and renal arteriovenous fistula without artery embolization were considered as minor complications.\nRESULTS: Two hundred and fifty-six TJRBs-119 without antithrombotics (untreated), 69 under aspirin and 68 on anticoagulants and 54 TCRBs without antithrombotics-were analysed. Their major and minor complication rates, respectively, did not differ significantly for the four groups: 0 and 8% for untreated TJRBs, 1 and 6% for aspirin-treated, 6 and 10% for anticoagulant-treated and 2 and 2% for TCRBs. The number of glomeruli sampled and the biopsy contribution to establishing a histological diagnosis was similar for the four groups.\nCONCLUSIONS: TJRBs obtained from SLE and APS patients taking antithrombotics had diagnostic yields and safety profiles similar to those of untreated TCRBs.

Over 6-year follow up, we compared rates of myocardial infarction (MI), all-cause mortality, revascularization, and major bleeding between black and white patients. A multivariable Cox regression model was fit to adjust for potentially confounding variables. Dual-antiplatelet therapy use over time was determined by patient follow-up surveys and compared by race.\nRESULTS: Black patients were younger; were more often female; had higher body mass indexes; had more diabetes mellitus, hypertension, and renal disease; and had lower median household incomes than white patients (P < .001). At 6 years after DES placement, black relative to white patients had higher unadjusted rates of MI (12.1% vs 10.1%, hazard ratio 1.25, 95% CI 1.00-1.57, P = .05) and major bleeding (17.8% vs 14.3%, hazard ratio 1.28, 95% CI 1.07-1.54, P = .01), but there were no significant differences in other outcomes. After multivariable adjustment, there were no statistically significant racial differences in any of these outcomes at 6 years. Similarly, dual-antiplatelet therapy use was comparable between racial groups.\nCONCLUSIONS: Unadjusted rates of MI and major bleeding over long-term follow up were higher among black patients compared to white patients, but these differences may be explained by racial differences in comorbid disease.",

Demographic and clinical data regarding the stone free rates, complication rates and need for secondary procedures were retrospectively evaluated.\nRESULTS: Of all the patients undergoing RIRS for kidney stones, 122 were below the age of 65 (73.9%) and 43 were above the age of 65 (26.1%). Mean age value for the patients aging more than 65 years was 74.16 ± 5.03 years and in addition to higher percentage of comorbidities, serum creatinine levels as well as ASA scores were also higher in this group when compared with younger counterparts. Although there was no statistically significant difference with respect to the operative duration, stone-free rates (SFR) and hospitalization period between the two groups, both complication rates and the need for additional interventions were higher in the older patient group (p = 0.038; p = 0.032).

        "Abstract":"IMPORTANCE: The presence of preexisting type 1 or type 2 diabetes in pregnancy increases the risk of adverse maternal and neonatal outcomes, such as preeclampsia, cesarean delivery, preterm delivery, macrosomia, and congenital defects. Approximately 0.9% of the 4 million births in the United States annually are complicated by preexisting diabetes.\nOBSERVATIONS: Women with diabetes have increased risk for adverse maternal and neonatal outcomes, and similar risks are present with type 1 and type 2 diabetes. Both forms of diabetes require similar intensity of diabetes care. Preconception planning is very important to avoid unintended pregnancies and to minimize risk of congenital defects. Hemoglobin A1c goals are less than 6.5% at conception and less than 6.0% during pregnancy. It is also critical to screen for and manage comorbid illnesses, such as retinopathy and nephropathy. Medications known to be unsafe in pregnancy, such as angiotensin-converting enzyme inhibitors and statins, should be discontinued. Women with obesity should be screened for obstructive sleep apnea, which is often undiagnosed and can result in poor outcomes. Blood pressure goals must be considered carefully because lower treatment thresholds may be required for women with nephropathy. During pregnancy, continuous glucose monitoring can improve glycemic control and neonatal outcomes in women with type 1 diabetes. Insulin is first-line therapy for all women with preexisting diabetes; injections and insulin pump therapy are both effective approaches. Rates of severe hypoglycemia are increased during pregnancy; therefore, glucagon should be available to the patient and close contacts should be trained in its use. Low-dose aspirin is recommended soon after 12 weeks' gestation to minimize the risk of preeclampsia. The importance of discussing long-acting reversible contraception before and after pregnancy, to allow for appropriate preconception planning, cannot be overstated.\nCONCLUSIONS AND RELEVANCE: Preexisting diabetes in pregnancy is complex and is associated with significant maternal and neonatal risk. Optimization of glycemic control, medication regimens, and careful attention to comorbid conditions can help mitigate these risks and ensure quality diabetes care before, during, and after pregnancy.",

        "Abstract":"BACKGROUND: An increased incidence of thromboembolic events (TE) are reported in nephrotic syndrome (NS) leading to recommendations for prophylactic anticoagulation (PAC). However, as no randomized clinical trial has established the efficacy or risks associated with PAC, guidelines are empiric or substantiated only by estimates of risks and benefits. This study evaluates the risk of TE and hemorrhagic complications in patients with NS treated with PAC and compares to patients not receiving PAC.\nMETHODS: We included patients diagnosed with NS from two Danish nephrology departments with different practices for the use of PAC. Patients were included if presenting with NS from September 2006 to January 2012, a P-albumin < 30 g\/L, and renal biopsy confirming non-diabetic, glomerular disease. Patients aged < 16 years, on renal replacement therapy, or administered anticoagulants at the onset of NS were excluded. Bleeding episodes and\/or TE were identified from patient records. Bleeding episodes were divided into minor and major bleeding.\nRESULTS: Of the 79 patients included, 44 patients received PAC either as low or high dose low-molecular-weight heparin (LMWH) or as warfarin with or without LMWH as bridging, while 35 did not receive PAC. P-albumin was significant lower in the PAC group compared to those not receiving PAC. Significantly more TEs was observed in the non-PAC group compared to the PAC group (4 versus 0 episodes, P = 0.035). The TEs observed included one patient with pulmonary embolism (PE), one with PE and deep vein thrombosis, one with PE and renal vein thrombosis, and one with a stroke. Five patients with bleeding episodes were identified among those receiving PAC, of which two were major and three were minor, while two patients in the non-PAC group experienced a minor bleeding episode (P = 0.45 between groups). The major bleeding episodes only occurred in patients receiving PAC in combination with low dose aspirin.\nCONCLUSIONS: In patients with NS the use of PAC was associated with a decreased risk of clinically significant TE, but may also be associated with more bleeding episodes although not statistically significant. Only patients treated with PAC in combination with anti-platelet therapy had major bleeding episodes.",

In the prospective part of the study, these patients were subdivided into four groups: group 1 consisted of 200 patients switched to Aspirin Cardio; group 2 - 200 pa - tients receiving chronic therapy with this drug; group 3 - 100 patients continuing on the Trombo Ass treatment; and group 4 - 100 pa - tients who had been treated with Cardiomagnyl for a long time. Efficacy, safety and compliance to the treatment were evaluated using standard tests and analogue scales; symptoms of dyspepsia were evaluated with a study-specific questionnaire. Switching to Aspirin Cardio (group 1) was on discretion of the physician in charge based on the history of gastrointestinal (GI) complications or significant manifestations of dyspepsia.\nRESULTS: The efficacy in prevention of cardiovascular events was similar in all groups. No \"major\" or \"minor, clinically significant\" bleeding (ISTH) were observed. Proportions of patients with \"minor\" bleeding were similar in all groups with a tendency towards their decrease under the Aspirin Cardio treatment. After switching to Aspirin Cardio, positive changes in severity of GI symptoms by results of the questionnaire: a significant improvement of compliance by the treatment satisfaction index in group 1 and 2; and a 1.7 time decrease in the proportion of ASA-noncompliant patients were observed. According to the results of ROC analysis an average GI symptom score ≥3 predicted an improvement of compliance in case of switching to Aspirin Cardio with a diagnostic sensitivity of 72.3% and specificity of 51.1% (р=0.012) as well as alleviation of GI symptoms (sensitivity, 74.5%; specificity, 63.8%, р=0.001).\nCONCLUSIONS: Different dosage forms of ASA are characterized with similar efficacy in prevention of cardiovascular events and effects on the risk of bleeding. Aspirin Cardio showed a better tolerability due to a less effect on GI symptoms. It provided a better compliance to chronic treatment. This study confirmed advisability of using the proposed questionnaire to evaluate GI symptoms for specification of prediction and modification of therapy.",

        "Published":"2019-12-24",
        "Abstract":"PURPOSE: The miniaturized percutaneous nephrolithotomy (mPNL) can be performed by using a very wide range of different access sheaths (14-22 Fr).It has been well known that tract size is one of the main parameters affecting the complication rates in PNL. We aimed to compare 21 Fr with 16.5 Fr mPNL tract sizes in adult patients.\nMATERIAL AND METHODS: From May 2013 to April 2018, 604 patients with kidney stone underwent mPNL in our department. The study was designed as retrospective and match-pair analysis was the preferred method for the formation of groups.  The 21 Fr mPNL cases were matched with 16.5 Fr mPNL cases at a 1:1 ratio, according to the patients' age, gender, body mass index, American Society of Anesthesiologists (ASA) score, stone characteristics (stone size, opacity and localization) and hydronephrosis. Patients with solitary kidney, renal anomalies, musculoskeletal abnormalities, and pediatric patients (< 18 years old) were excluded from the study. Both groups (21 Fr and 16.5 Fr) were compared in terms of demographics, stone characteristics, operative data and post-operative outcomes.\nRESULTS: A total of 260 patients were included in the study (130; 21 Fr mPNL group and 130; 16.5 Fr mPNL group). The operation time was significantly shorter in 21 Fr group (21 Fr; 85.2±37.5, 16.5 Fr; 101.7±37.7 minutes, p: 0.001). Complete stone clearance rates were 76.9% and 62.3% in 21 Fr and 16.5 Fr mPNL, respectively (p: 0.01). There was no significant difference between the groups in terms of overall operative and post-operative complications. However, in subgroups analysis, post-operative fever was higher in 16,5 Fr mPNL (4 patients in 16.5 Fr, no patients in 21 Fr group, p: 0.044); steinstrasse, renal colic and post-operative JJ stent requirement rates were higher in 21 Fr mPNL procedure (p: 0.018, p: 0.031 and p: 0.046, respectively). The hospitalization time was significantly higher in 21 Fr (p: 0.01).\nCONCLUSIONS: Although 21 Fr mPNL procedure has advantages such as better success rates and shorter operation time, some post-operative complications (steinstrasse, renal colic, post-operative JJ stent requirement) are against of 21 Fr mPNL when compared with 16.5 Fr mPNL procedure. Further randomized prospective studies with larger patient volume are needed to confirm these results.",

        "Abstract":"BACKGROUND: Childhood Takayasu's arteritis (c-TA) is scarcely reported but is characterized by devastating morbidity and mortality. This study aims to investigate the clinical course of c-TA and prognostic factors associated with rehospitalization and events including vascular complications, flares, and death.\nMETHODS: An ambispective study of 101 c-TA patients satisfying the American College of Rheumatology (ACR) criteria and\/or the European League against Rheumatism (EULAR)\/Pediatric Rheumatology International Trials Organization (PRINTO)\/Pediatric Rheumatology European Society (PReS) criteria was conducted from January 2002 to December 2017. Data on demographic, clinical, laboratory, imaging, and therapeutic features were collected. Event-free survival, complication-free survival, flare-free survival, rehospitalization-free survival, and associated prognostic factors were assessed by Kaplan-Meier survival curve and propensity score analysis.\nRESULTS: The median age at c-TA onset was 14 (interquartile range (IQR) 12-16) years and 76.2% were female. Hypertension (70.3%), blood pressure discrepancy (55.4%), bruits (51.5%), and pulse deficits (37.6%) were core presentations. Major vascular involvement included the renal artery (62.4%), abdominal aorta (42.6%), subclavian artery (43.6%), and carotid artery (42.6%). Glucocorticoids (78.2%), antihypertensive drugs (72.3%), antiplatelet agents (72.3%), and revascularization (57.4%) were made up the majority administered. At a median 2.4 (IQR 0.7-6.1) years of follow-up, events, rehospitalization, vascular complications, flares and death were observed in 44.6%, 37.6%, 44.6%, 26.7%, and 3%, respectively. The 5-year event-free survival, rehospitalization-free survival, vascular complication-free survival, and flare-free survival were 42.8%, 55.8%, 45.9%, and 62.3%, respectively. Body mass index (BMI) (hazard ratio (HR) = 0.49, 95% confidence interval (CI) 0.30-0.81, p = 0.005), stroke (HR = 7.37, 95% CI 2.35-23.1, p = 0.001), and revascularization (HR = 0.51, 95% CI 0.27-0.94, p = 0.032) were independent prognostic predictors of events. Predictors for rehospitalization include age at admission (HR = 0.81, 95% CI 0.69-0.94, p = 0.006), renal artery involvement (HR = 0.49, 95% CI 0.25-0.96, p = 0.037), and elevated C-reactive protein (CRP; HR = 2.50, 95% CI 1.24-5.00, p = 0.01). BMI level (p = 0.024) and renal artery involvement (p = 0.015) were also associated with vascular complications, while revascularization (p = 0.002) independently correlated with re-flares.\nCONCLUSIONS: This large ambispective study of c-TA revealed an early 3% mortality at the first year and around 50% morbidity within 5 years after diagnosis. Hypertension, renal artery involvement, and revascularization based on anti-inflammation, antihypertension, and antiplatelet medications dominated c-TA with indications for optimistic prognosis. Patients with initial lower BMI level, a younger age at admission, stroke, and elevated CRP have a high risk of poor outcomes, requiring close c-TA monitoring and more aggressive management.\nTRIAL REGISTRATION: NCT03199183 , unique protocol ID: 2016-ZX43.

        "Published":"2018-11-04",
        "Abstract":"BACKGROUND: Dalteparin sodium, a low-molecular-weight heparin, is indicated for prevention of clotting in the extracorporeal circuit during hemodialysis (HD). Product labeling recommends a fixed single-bolus dose of 5000 international units (IU) for HD sessions lasting up to 4 hours, but adjustable dosing may be beneficial in clinical practice.\nOBJECTIVE: The aim of the PARROT study was to investigate the safety and efficacy of an adjustable dose of dalteparin in patients with end-stage renal disease requiring 3 to 4 HD sessions per week.\nDESIGN: A 7-week, open-label, multicenter study with a single treatment arm, conducted between October 2013 and March 2016.\nSETTING: Ten sites in Canada.\nPATIENTS: A total of 152 patients with end-stage renal disease requiring 3 to 4 HD sessions per week.\nMEASUREMENTS: The primary outcome was the proportion of HD sessions completed without premature termination due to inadequate anticoagulation.\nMETHODS: All participants initially received a dose of 5000 IU dalteparin, which could be adjusted at subsequent HD sessions when clinically indicated, by increment or decrement of 500 or 1000 IU, with no specified dose limits.\nRESULTS: Patients were followed for 256 patient-months. Nearly all (99.9%; 95% confidence interval [CI]: 99.7-100) evaluable HD sessions were completed without premature clotting. Dose was adjusted for more than half (52.3%) of participants, mostly owing to clotting or access compression time >10 minutes. Median dalteparin dose was 5000 IU (range: 500-13 000 IU). There were no major bleeds, and minor bleeding was reported in 2.3% of all HD sessions. There was no evidence of bioaccumulation.\nLIMITATIONS: This short-term study, with a single treatment arm, was designed to optimize dalteparin dose using a flexible dosing schedule; it was not designed to specifically evaluate dalteparin dose minimization, provide a direct comparison of dalteparin versus unfractionated heparin, or provide information on long-term safety for flexible dalteparin dosing. Patients were excluded if they were at high risk of bleeding, including those on anticoagulants and those on antiplatelet agents other than aspirin <100 mg\/d.\nCONCLUSIONS: Overall, an adjustable dalteparin sodium dose regimen allowed safe completion of HD, with clinical benefits over fixed dosing.\nTRIAL REGISTRATION: ClinicalTrials.gov NCT01879618, registered June 13, 2013.",

Platelet reactivity was assessed at 30-90 days by Multiple-electrode aggregometry. In an additional cohort of diabetic patients naïve to antiplatelet therapy, we assessed platelet reactivity by light transmission aggregometry, surface expression of P-selectin and plasma concentration of Thromboxane B2 (TxB2).\nRESULTS: We included 219 diabetic patients, 117 (53.4%) treated with metformin. Metformin was associated with younger age (p=0.03), male gender (p=0.02), lower rate of hypertension (p=0.04), active smoker (p=0.002), previous MI (p<0.001) renal failure (p<0.001), fibrinogen (p<0.001) and C-reactive protein (p=0.04), larger use of diuretics (p=0.04) calcium antagonists (p=0.05), better glycemic control (p<0.001) and higher haemoglobin (p=0.003).

        "Abstract":"Lipoprotein glomerulopathy (LPG) is an uncommon cause of nephrotic syndrome and\/or kidney failure. At microscopy, LPG is characterized by the presence of lipoprotein thrombi in dilated glomerular capillaries due to different ApoE mutations. ApoE gene is located on chromosome 19q13.2, and can be identified in almost all serum lipoproteins. ApoE works as a protective factor in atherosclerosis due its interaction with receptor-mediated lipoprotein clearance and cholesterol receptor. Most common polymorphisms include ApoE2\/2, ApoE3\/2, ApoE3\/3, ApoE4\/2, ApoE4\/3, and ApoE4\/4. All age-groups can be affected by LPG, with a discrete male predominance. Compromised patients typically reveal dyslipidemia, type III hyperlipoproteinemia, and proteinuria. LPG treatment includes fenofibrate, antilipidemic drugs, steroids, LDL aphaeresis, plasma exchange, antiplatelet drugs, anticoagulants, urokinase, and renal transplantation. Recurrence in kidney graft suggests a pathogenic component(s) of extraglomerular humoral complex resulting from abnormal lipoprotein metabolism and presumably associated to ApoE.",

        "Abstract":"OBJECTIVES: To investigate the prevalence, predictors and associations between guideline-directed medical therapy (GDMT) and clinical outcomes in acute myocardial infarction (AMI) patients undergoing percutaneous coronary intervention (PCI) from eight academic centers in the United States.\nBACKGROUND: Evidence for GDMT in patients with AMI comes from randomized controlled trials. The use of GDMT in clinical practice is unknown in this setting.\nMETHODS: PROMETHEUS is a multicenter observational registry comprising 19,914 patients with acute coronary syndrome (ACS) undergoing PCI. Patients with AMI were divided into two groups based on the prescription of GDMT or not (non-GDMT) at discharge. GDMT was defined according to American College of Cardiology\/American Heart Association (ACC\/AHA) class I recommendations, specifically, dual antiplatelet therapy, statin and beta-blocker for all AMI patients, and additional ACEI\/ARB in patients with left ventricular ejection fraction (LVEF) less than 40%, hypertension, diabetes mellitus (DM) or chronic kidney disease (CKD). The primary endpoint was major adverse cardiovascular events (MACE) defined as a composite of all-cause death, MI, stroke or unplanned target vessel revascularization (TVR) at 1 year.\nRESULTS: Out of 4,834 patients with AMI, 3,356 (69.4%) patients were discharged on GDMT. Patients receiving GDMT were more often younger and male. Compared with non-GDMT patients, GDMT patients had a significantly lower frequency of comorbidities. Predictors of greater GDMT prescription at discharge were ST-segment elevation myocardial infarction (STEMI), and increased body mass index (BMI), whereas hypertension, prior PCI, anemia and CKD were associated with less GDMT prescription. At 1 year, the use of GDMT was associated with a significantly lower incidence of MACE (13.7% vs. 22.5%; adjusted HR 0.68; 95%CI 0.58-0.80; P < 0.001), death (3.7% vs. 9.4%; adjusted HR 0.61; 95%CI 0.46-0.80; P < 0.001), and unplanned TVR (8.4% vs. 11.3%; adjusted HR 0.76; 95%CI 0.61-0.96; P = 0.020). However, there were no significant differences in the incidence of MI (4.3% vs. 7.0%; adjusted HR 0.75; 95%CI 0.56-1.01; P = 0.056), stroke (1.5% vs. 2.0%; adjusted HR 0.79; 95%CI 0.47-1.34; P = 0.384) between the two groups.\nCONCLUSION: In a contemporary practice setting in the United States, GDMT was utilized in just over two-thirds of AMI patients undergoing PCI. Predictors of GDMT prescription at discharge included STEMI, BMI and absence of hypertension, CKD, anemia or prior PCI. Use of GDMT was associated with significantly lower risk of 1-year MACE and mortality.",

        "Abstract":"Introduction Chronic kidney disease (CKD) is one of risk factors for stroke and may be associated with impaired platelet reactivity. Objectives The aim of the study was to evaluate platelet reactivity in patients with CKD treated with acetylsalicylic acid (ASA), using 2 different laboratory methods. Moreover, we searched for factors responsible for the phenomenon of high on-treatment platelet reactivity (HOPR). Patients and methods A total of 108 patients with CKD and 41 controls without CKD using ASA were enrolled in the study. Platelet function was assessed by impedance aggregometry in whole blood, using a multi-channel platelet function analyzer (Multiplate®; ASPItest). Urinary 11-dehydrotromboxane levels were measured by the AspirinWorks® test. Results No significant differences were observed in the prevalence of HOPR between patients with and without CKD. Patients with CKD and HOPR measured by ASPItest had higher creatinine levels (P = 0.05) and were younger (P <0.01) than patients with CKD without HOPR, while patients with CKD and HOPR measured by AspirinWorks® had lower red blood cell count (P = 0.05), hemoglobin (P = 0.05), hematocrit (P = 0.05), and high-density lipoprotein levels (P = 0.05). All patients with HOPR had higher C-reactive protein levels (P <0.05) (AspirinWorks®) and white blood cells (P <0.05) (ASPItest). Conclusions The applied methods allowed to detect HOPR in more than one third of CKD patients taking ASA for stroke prevention. The compatibility of both methods for HOPR assessment was confirmed. The study revealed several potential risk factors for HOPR in CKD, including younger age, higher levels of inflammatory markers, dyslipidemia, and lower hematocrit and hemoglobin levels.",

Finally, the time of filters (hours: 60.52±8.82, 31.04±7.03, 13.73±6.26, F = 183.412, P < 0.001) and the number of filter during treatment (number: 2.03±0.60, 3.12±0.73, 4.64±1.29, F = 45.933, P < 0.001) in the RCA group, LMHA group and NA group had statistically significant difference. Meanwhile, the incidence of adverse events such as bleeding (0 vs. 4, 7, χ  = 23.961, P < 0.001) and frequent filter coagulation (1 vs. 10, 11, χ  = 35.413, P < 0.001) in RCA group was significantly lower than that in LMHA group and NA group. Kaplan-Meier survival analysis showed that the life time of the first filter in RCA group was significantly longer than that in LMHA group and NA group (χ = 139.45, P < 0.05).\nCONCLUSIONS: The application of RCA in patients with AKI after hepatectomy during CRRT is safe and effective, which can significantly prolong the life of the filter and reduce the risk of bleeding.",

        "Published":"2018-09-04",
        "Abstract":"BACKGROUND: Henoch-Schonlein Purpura (HSP) is one of the most common vasculitides of childhood, with 10-20 cases per 100,000 children. It frequently occurs following an infectious trigger and involves IgA and C3 deposition in small vessel walls. HSP is characterized by palpable purpura plus IgA deposition on biopsy, arthritis\/arthralgia, renal involvement (hematuria and\/or proteinuria), and\/or abdominal pain. It is not generally recognized as a cause of dilated coronary arteries.\nCASE PRESENTATION: We describe the first reported case of HSP presenting with dilated coronary arteries. This patient is a nine-year-old previously healthy Caucasian male who presented with 1 week of petechiae on his lower legs, knee and ankle arthritis, and abdominal pain without fever, consistent with HSP. An echocardiogram revealed coronary dilation, including the left main (5.32 mm, Z score + 4.25) and left anterior descending (LAD) (3.51 mm, Z score + 2.64) coronary arteries. He received high dose aspirin, IVIG, and infliximab with normalization of the LAD. Skin biopsy revealed leukocytoclastic vasculitis with positive IgA staining. He was Rhinovirus\/Enterovirus positive with Group A Streptococcus on throat culture.\nCONCLUSION: Cardiac findings, while rare, can exist in HSP. Coronary dilation appeared to respond to our hospital protocol's Kawasaki Disease (KD) therapy, possibly indicating an overlap in HSP and KD pathophysiology. This case, along with prior reports of dilated coronaries in systemic juvenile idiopathic arthritis (SJIA), highlights the importance of considering other sources of systemic inflammation, in addition to KD, when coronary dilation is identified. The appropriate therapy, follow-up, and prognosis for our patient are not clear, as further studies are needed to determine the natural course of these findings.",

        "Abstract":"BACKGROUND: Cardiac events (CE) following surgery have been associated with morbidity and mortality. Defining risk factors that contribute to CE is essential to improve surgical outcomes.\nSTUDY DESIGN: This was a retrospective study at a large urban teaching hospital for surgery performed from 2013 to 2015. Adult patients (≥18 years) that underwent general and vascular surgery were analyzed. Patients were grouped into those who experienced postoperative CE and those who did not. Univariate and multivariate regression analyses were used to identify predictors of postoperative CE, and association of CE with adverse postoperative outcomes. Separate subgroup analyses were also conducted for general and vascular surgery patients to assess predictors of CE.\nRESULTS: Out of 8441 patients, 157 (1.9%) experienced CE after major general and vascular surgery. Underlying predictors for CE included age >65 years(OR 4.9, 95%CI 3.4-6.9,p < 0.01), ASA >3(OR 12.0, 95%CI 8.5-16.9,p < 0.01), emergency surgery(OR 3.7, 95%CI 2.7-5.1,p = 0.01), CHF(OR 11.2, 95%CI 6.4-16.7,p = 0.02), COPD(OR 3.9, 95%CI 2.4-6.4,p = 0.04), acute renal failure or dialysis(OR 8.0, 95%CI 5.2-12.1,p = 0.04), weight loss(OR 3.3, 95%CI 1.7-6.7,p < 0.01), preoperative creatinine >1.2 mg\/dL(OR 5.1, 95%CI 3.7-7.1,p = 0.01), hematocrit <34%(OR 4.0, 95%CI 2.8-5.7,p < 0.01), and operative time >240 min(OR 2.0, 95%CI 1.3-3.3,p = 0.02).

There was no statistical difference in incidence of CE between general and vascular surgery patients (p = 0.44); however, predictors of CE differed between the two surgical groups.\nCONCLUSION: Postoperative CE are associated with significant morbidity and mortality.

        "Abstract":"BACKGROUND\/OBJECTIVES: Currently, there are no widely accepted cut-off points to categorize patients as sarcopenic (low skeletal muscle mass) or myosteatotic based on computed tomography (CT) measurements. Moreover, little is known about skeletal muscle mass in healthy subjects, particularly in a Western-European population.\nSUBJECTS\/METHODS: Skeletal muscle mass (skeletal muscle index, cm\/m) and density (Hounsfield units, HU) at the level of the third lumbar vertebra were measured on contrast-enhanced CT images in live kidney donors with an age range of 18-86 years, who may be considered as healthy subjects, from 2010 to 2015. Differences between sex, body mass index (BMI), age groups, and American Society of Anesthesiologists (ASA) classification were assessed. Mann-Whitney U and Kruskal-Wallis tests were used to compare groups.\nRESULTS: Of the 1073 included patients, 499 (46.5%) were male and the median age and BMI were 51 years and 25.4 kg\/m, respectively. Male gender, increased age, and increased BMI were significantly associated with both skeletal muscle mass and density. Nomograms including these parameters were developed to calculate the estimated skeletal muscle mass and density of a healthy subject and the lower bound of the 90% prediction interval (p5) values were provided.\nCONCLUSIONS: Skeletal muscle density and mass were significantly associated with sex, age, and BMI in a large cohort of healthy Western-European subjects. The newly developed nomograms may be used to calculate the estimated healthy skeletal muscle mass for individuals in patient populations.",

        "Published":"2018-08-09",
        "Abstract":"BACKGROUND: End-stage renal disease (ESRD) is the last stage of chronic kidney disease, mainly caused by type 2 diabetes mellitus and characterized by an increased mortality risk related to cardiovascular disease. Low-dose aspirin (acetylsalicylic acid or ASA) seems to effectively prevent cardiovascular events in patients with ESRD. However, the number of interventional studies in this population remains limited and the mechanisms of aspirin-related bleeding remain poorly understood. Aspirin's efficacy and safety may be modified by the presence of type 2 diabetes mellitus or platelet hyperreactivity.\nOBJECTIVE: The overall objective of this protocol is to (1) evaluate aspirin's safety and efficacy in reducing the risk of thrombotic events in patients with ESRD on hemodialysis and (2) examine whether aspirin's efficacy is modified by the presence of type 2 diabetes mellitus or platelet hyperreactivity. Specifically, the primary objective is to compare the 12-month rate of any thrombotic event (cardiac death, nonfatal myocardial infarction, nonfatal stroke, arteriovenous fistula thrombosis) and Thrombolysis in Myocardial Infarction (TIMI) major bleeding in patients treated with aspirin compared to those on placebo. Secondary objectives are to test for effect modification of treatment by the presence of type 2 diabetes mellitus or platelet hyperreactivity and compare the rate of TIMI minor bleeding between treatment groups.\nMETHODS: We developed a protocol for a phase 2 randomized, single-center, placebo-controlled, triple-blind, superiority clinical trial to assess the prophylactic efficacy and safety of aspirin in patients with ESRD and on hemodialysis. It follows the ethical principles of the Declaration of Helsinki of the World Medical Association. A total of 342 participants would be enrolled over 12 months at a large dialysis center. Patients will be randomized in a 1:1 ratio and stratified by presence of type 2 diabetes mellitus and platelet hyperreactivity to receive either oral aspirin (100 mg\/d) or placebo for a treatment period of 12 months. An intention-to-treat statistical analysis will be performed.\nRESULTS: The randomized clinical trial will be performed after approval by the ethical committee of the participating center and registration at ClinicalTrials.gov.\nCONCLUSIONS: We provide a protocol for a randomized controlled trial to evaluate the safety and efficacy of treatment with aspirin to reduce the risk of thrombotic events. In addition, such a study would further our understanding of the mechanism of aspirin-related bleeding and help identify subgroups of best-responders and patients with a higher risk of adverse events.\nREGISTERED REPORT IDENTIFIER: RR1-10.2196\/10516.",

        "Abstract":"BACKGROUND: Two previous randomized controlled trials showed that treatment of severe childhood immunoglobulin A (IgA) nephropathy using prednisolone with azathioprine, heparin-warfarin, or dipyridamole prevented the increase of sclerosed glomeruli. Prednisolone alone, however, did not prevent further increase. These studies indicated the importance of immunosuppressants in the treatment. An additional pilot study using mizoribine instead of azathioprine enabled us to complete 2 years of combined regimen. It showed non-numerical inferior effectiveness compared with the azathioprine regimen. Further examination of the additional efficacy of warfarin and dipyridamole was required.\nMETHODS: A randomized control trial of prednisolone and mizoribine with (group 1) or without (group 2) warfarin and dipyridamole was administered for treatment of 71 children with severe IgA nephropathy to evaluate the efficacy of additional warfarin and dipyridamole.\nRESULTS: Thirty of 34 patients (88.2%) in group 1, and 27 of 36 patients (75.0%) showed the disappearance of proteinuria as defined by early morning urinary protein to creatinine ratio of < 0.2 during the 2-year treatment period. The cumulative disappearance rate of proteinuria determined by the Kaplan-Meier method showed that the disappearance rate of proteinuria was significantly higher in group 1 than in group 2 (log-rank P = 0.04). There was no significant difference in pathological findings, but there was a tendency of increase of global sclerosis in group1 which might be related to warfarin. Most of the adverse effects were related to prednisolone, but fortunately transient.\nCONCLUSIONS: The balance between minimal benefits of warfarin\/dipyridamole and potential adverse effects may be in favor of avoiding them in children with IgA nephropathy.",

In this registry analysis, we compared efficacy and safety of ticagrelor and prasugrel P2Y12 inhibition in patients with STEMI. We included 318 patients in this single-center analysis. Twelve-month follow-up was conducted during ambulatory care at our department. Patients were on dual antiplatelet therapy with aspirin and ticagrelor or prasugrel during the follow-up period. Prescription of prasugrel or ticagrelor, respectively, was according to the preference of the treating physician. Major adverse cardiac and cerebrovascular events (MACCE) [death, myocardial infarction (MI), stroke, and unplanned reintervention] and thrombolysis in myocardial infarction (TIMI) bleeding (major\/minor) were registered during hospitalization and follow-up. TIMI bleeding events were more frequent in ticagrelor-treated patients [17 vs. 5 patients, hazard ratio (HR) 2.85, 95% confidence interval (CI) 1.2-6.6; log-rank P value = 0.01]. Prasugrel-treated patients were significantly younger (ticagrelor 63 ± 12 years vs. prasugrel 57 ± 10; P < 0.0001). Besides that, patients' characteristics were similar in both groups. Multivariate analysis revealed that ticagrelor medication was independently associated with bleeding risk after adjustment for age, percutaneous coronary intervention approach (femoral vs. radial), diabetes mellitus, and kidney function (HR 3.01; 95% CI 1.0-7.4; P = 0.043). In patients treated with ticagrelor, 35 MACCE were detected. There was no difference as compared to prasugrel-treated patients (24 events, HR 1.24, 95% CI 0.79-2.09; log-rank P value = 0.41). TIMI bleeding events were more frequent in ticagrelor-treated patients with STEMI during 12-month follow-up. There were no differences in MACCE between groups in this registry analysis.",

Women at risk of preeclampsia are defined based on the presence of one or more high-risk factors (history of preeclampsia, multifetal gestation, renal disease, autoimmune disease, type 1 or type 2 diabetes, and chronic hypertension) or more than one of several moderate-risk factors (first pregnancy, maternal age of 35 years or older, a body mass index greater than 30, family history of preeclampsia, sociodemographic characteristics, and personal history factors). In the absence of high risk factors for preeclampsia, current evidence does not support the use of prophylactic low-dose aspirin for the prevention of early pregnancy loss, fetal growth restriction, stillbirth, or preterm birth.",

        "Abstract":"BACKGROUND: Preterm birth is one of the leading causes of perinatal morbidity and mortality. Clinical data suggest that low-dose aspirin may decrease the rate of overall preterm birth, but investigators have speculated that this is likely due to a decrease in medically indicated preterm birth through its effect on the incidence of preeclampsia and other placental disease. We hypothesized that low-dose aspirin may also have an impact on the mechanism of spontaneous preterm labor.\nOBJECTIVE: Our objective was to determine whether low-dose aspirin reduces the rate of spontaneous preterm birth in nulliparous women without medical comorbidities.\nSTUDY DESIGN: This is a secondary analysis of a randomized, placebo-controlled trial of low-dose aspirin for the prevention of preeclampsia in healthy, low-risk, nulliparous women. Low-risk women were defined by the absence of hypertension, renal disease, diabetes, other endocrine disorders, seizures, heart disease, or collagen vascular disease. Our study was limited to singleton, nonanomalous gestations. Women were eligible if they had prior pregnancy terminations but not prior spontaneous pregnancy loss <20 weeks. Current pregnancies that resulted in a loss or termination <20 weeks or antepartum stillbirth or had missing follow-up data were excluded. The treatment intervention was 60 mg of aspirin, initiated at 13-25 weeks' gestation or matching placebo. The primary outcome was spontaneous preterm birth <34 weeks' gestation. Secondary outcomes included spontaneous preterm birth <37 weeks and overall preterm birth <37 and <34 weeks. Baseline demographics and primary and secondary outcomes were compared between treatment groups. A logistic regression model was used to adjust for confounders related to spontaneous preterm birth.\nRESULTS: Of 2543 included women, 1262 (49.6%) received low-dose aspirin and 1281 (50.4%) placebo. Baseline characteristics were similar between groups, except for marital status. The rate of spontaneous preterm birth <34 weeks was 1.03% (n = 13) and 2.34% (n = 30) in the low-dose aspirin and placebo group, respectively (odds ratio, 0.43, 95% confidence interval, 0.26-0.84). Additionally, the rate of spontaneous preterm birth <37 weeks was 6.58% (n = 83) in the low-dose aspirin group and 7.03% (n = 90) in the placebo group (odds ratio, 0.97, 95% confidence interval, 0.71-1.33), and the rate of overall preterm birth <37 weeks was 7.84% (n = 99) in the low-dose aspirin group and 8.2% (n = 105) in the placebo group (odds ratio, 0.97, 95% confidence interval, 0.72-1.31). After adjustment for variables that were clinically relevant or statistically significant, including body mass index, race, tobacco use, marital status, and education level, there was a significant reduction in spontaneous preterm birth <34 weeks in the low-dose aspirin group (adjusted odds ratio, 0.46, 95% confidence interval, 0.23-0.89). The rates of overall preterm birth <34 and <37 weeks and spontaneous preterm birth <37 weeks were similar in women who received low-dose aspirin compared with placebo.\nCONCLUSION: Low-dose aspirin is associated with a substantial decrease in spontaneous preterm birth <34 weeks in healthy nulliparous women without comorbidities. These findings suggest a new therapeutic option for preterm birth prevention that requires further study.",

        "Abstract":"RATIONALE: The typical symptoms of stress cardiomyopathy include sudden-onset chest pain and breathlessness or collapse as well as classical symptoms of cardiovascular disease; however, rare reports have described nervous system symptoms as the initial manifestation. Here, we report the case of a young man who presented with a large cerebral infarction as the main clinical symptom of stress cardiomyopathy to increase recognition of the disease.\nPATIENT CONCERNS: A 28-year-old man was admitted to our hospital for sudden-onset weakness of the right limbs and unconsciousness for 1 day. Ten days prior, he began consuming copious amounts of alcohol (500 mL\/day) secondary to reactive depression.\nDIAGNOSES: Imaging revealed a left internal carotid artery occlusion as assessed by carotid artery ultrasonography. Brain magnetic resonance imaging\/magnetic resonance angiography showed new large left cerebral infarction complicated by a reperfusion injury. Moreover, cardiac ultrasonography showed decreased motion of the left ventricular apex, a 3.7 cm mural thrombus in the ventricular apex. The results of coronary and renal artery angiography did not reveal any significant epicardial coronary disease with thrombolysis in the myocardial infarction grade 3 in any of the coronary arteries.\nINTERVENTIONS: The patient was administered antiplatelet, anticoagulation, antihypertension, antibiotic, and neurotrophic therapies.\nOUTCOMES: The symptoms of cerebral infarction improved significantly after 12 days of admission. Cardiac ultrasonography showed that the wall movement of the left ventricular apex had recovered fully and the mural thrombus resolved completely.\nLESSONS: Patients with stress cardiomyopathy exhibit various clinical manifestations and characteristics. On the basis of our in-depth understanding of stress cardiomyopathy, clinicians should diagnose early and develop reasonable and effective therapies to prevent the harmful effects of related complications.",

        "Abstract":"BACKGROUND: Solid renal masses are increasingly treated with nephron-sparing surgery. As in other uro-oncological surgical techniques, minimally invasive and robotic-assisted techniques are becoming increasingly popular.\nOBJECTIVES: The perioperative results from minimally invasive nephron-sparing surgery versus open surgery were retrospectively compared.\nMATERIALS AND METHODS: In our single center retrospective study, all patients who underwent nephron-sparing tumor excision between 2006 and 2016 were divided into two groups (group O = open approach and group M = minimally invasive approach). The (pre-)operative data, complications, and change in renal function were compared. Trifecta criteria (R0, no perioperative complications, ischemia ≤25 min) were used to determine success rates.\nRESULTS: Of 329 patients, 310 were included for analysis (group O 123, group M 187). Patients in group O had significantly worse ASA score but comparable Charlson Index and significantly more pT3\/4 tumors but equal PADUA-score when compared with group M. Otherwise, preoperative patient and tumor characteristics were comparable. Patients in group M had significantly shorter hospital stays (p < 0.001) and lower transfusion rates (p < 0.05). Trifecta criteria were more frequently met in group M than in O (M: 66.8% vs. 0: 49.6%; p < 0.001). Both major and minor complications were lower in group M (major: 10.7% vs 17.1%; minor: 13.9% vs. 26.0%; p < 0.05). Preservation of renal function was comparable in both groups. R0 rates did not differ significantly between groups (M: 97.8% vs O: 97.5%). Surgical procedure times were significantly longer in group M (p < 0.001; mean 30 min).\nCONCLUSIONS: Minimally invasive, robotic assisted partial nephrectomy also proved to be successful in complex cases. In all aspects studied, the minimally invasive approach was shown to be at least equivalent to the open approach.",

In this study we aim to compare the outcomes of supine PCNL in elderly patients with those of younger population.\nMATERIAL AND METHODS: A matched case-control study was performed from January 2009 through December 2015 using our prospectively collected kidney stone database. Case group was composed of patients with age greater than 70 years. Control group included patients with less than 70 years old. Patients were randomly matched based on Guy's Stone Score as a surrogate of case complexity.\nRESULTS: Fifty-four patients were enrolled in this study, 18 cases and 36 controls. There were no significant differences in gender and body mass index between groups. There were significantly more ASA 3 patients in septuagenarian and octogenarian patients (p = 0.012). Mean Charlson comorbidity index was significantly higher in septuagenarian and octogenarian patients (p = 0.041). Regarding PCNL technique, there were no differences in number of accesses, number of supra-costal accesses, and operative time. There was no significant difference in stone-free rate, nephrostomy tube time, complication rate, mean decrease in hemoglobin level, and need of blood transfusion. Hospital stay time (days) was longer in case group (4.0 +\/- 1.7 versus 2.4 +\/- 1.1 days; p = 0.002).\nCONCLUSION: Septuagenarian and octogenarian patients have similar complication and stone-free rates compared to younger patients, although they demand a longer length of hospital stay.",

        "Published":null,
        "Abstract":"Coronary artery disease (CAD) assessment is a vital part of liver transplantation (LT) evaluation, as it allows for identification and medical optimization prior to transplantation. Although aspirin and statins are standard of care for CAD, they are not universally used in cirrhosis due to concerns about adverse events. Per protocol, coronary angiography was performed as part of the LT evaluation in all patients over the age of 50 years or with CAD risk factors, even if they were younger than 50. Optimal CAD medical management was defined as the use of both statin and aspirin, unless a contraindication was documented. Impact of these medications on hepatic decompensation, renal function, gastrointestinal bleeding, and need for transfusion was evaluated. CAD was detected in 84\/228 (36.8%) patients. Lipid profile was similar in patients with and without CAD. In patients with CAD, statins were started in 19 (23%), while aspirin was used in 30 (36%) patients. In patients with obstructive or multivessel CAD, statin therapy was used only in 41% and 65%, respectively. Statins were more likely to be prescribed in patients with diabetes (32% versus 15%, P = 0.05) and history of dyslipidemia (38% versus 15%, P = 0.02). Use of statin therapy was not linked to hepatic decompensation, hospitalization, or rise in Model for End-Stage Liver Disease (MELD). Similarly, use of aspirin therapy was not associated with increased risk acute variceal hemorrhage, gastrointestinal bleeding, or worsening anemia. In conclusion, in decompensated cirrhosis, lipid profile alone is unable to risk stratify patients with CAD. Statin and aspirin appear to be safe. However, they are significantly underutilized for the management of CAD in this patient population. Liver Transplantation 24 872-880 2018 AASLD.",

We estimated the prevalence of fatal ADR using a double arcsine method and explored heterogeneity using the following study characteristics: age groups, wards, study region, ADR definitions, ADR identification methods, study duration and sample size. We examined patterns of fatal ADR and causative drugs.\nRESULTS: Among 312 full-text articles assessed, 49 studies satisfied the selection criteria and were included in the analysis. The mean prevalence of fatal ADR was 0.20% (95% CI: 0.13-0.27%; I = 93%). The age groups and study wards were the important heterogeneity modifiers. The mean fatal ADR prevalence varied from 0.01% in paediatric patients to 0.44% in the elderly. Subgroup analysis showed a higher prevalence of fatal ADR in intensive care units, emergency departments, multispecialty wards and whole hospitals. Computer-based monitoring systems in combination with other methods detected higher mortality. Intracranial haemorrhage, renal failure and gastrointestinal bleeding accounted for more than 50% of fatal ADRcases. Warfarin, aspirin, renin-angiotensin system (RAS) inhibitors and digoxin accounted for 60% of fatal ADR.\nCONCLUSIONS: ADR is an important cause of mortality. Strategies targeting the safer use of warfarin, aspirin, RAS inhibitors and digoxin could reduce the large number of fatal ADRcases.",

        "Abstract":"['2', '2']\nClopidogrel resistance is prevalent in chronic kidney disease (CKD) patients. Genetic polymorphism is considered to be the most important factor that influences clopidogrel resistance. Limited data exist as to the role of pharmacogenetics in prognosis of stroke patients with impaired renal function on clopidogrel. We sought to explore whether decreased kidney function alters the association between CYP2C19 genetic variants and clinical outcome in patients with minor stroke or transient ischemic attack (TIA) receiving clopidogrel therapy. A total of 1476 participants on clopidogrel-aspirin treatment with genotyping results in High-Risk Patients with Acute Nondisabling Cerebrovascular Events (CHANCE) trial were categorized by quintiles of renal function estimated by estimated glomerular filtration rate (eGFR), and were stratified according to the possession of CYP2C19 loss-of-function (LOF) alleles: carriers and non-carriers. Patients were followed up and clinical outcomes were evaluated. The primary efficacy outcome was new stroke. The secondary efficacy outcome was combined vascular events (ischemic stroke, hemorrhagic stroke, myocardial infarction, or vascular death). The safety outcome was bleeding event. CYP2C19 LOF carriers had higher odds of new stroke than non-carriers (10.4% versus 2.4 %, hazard ratio [HR], 5.30; 95% CI, 1.51-18.3, P = 0.009) in the lowest quintile of renal function group with eGFR < 75 ml\/min\/1.73 m but not in the other four higher quintiles. Similar results were observed for the ischemic stroke and combined vascular events. There was no significant difference in the individual outcomes of bleeding in carriers compared with non-carriers in any renal function group. Among patients with minor stroke or TIA taking clopidogrel-aspirin treatment, CYP2C19 LOF carrier state was associated with higher risk of new stroke in those with eGFR < 75 ml\/min\/1.73 m. This observation supports that the evaluation of CYP2C19 LOF carrier state may be useful for identification of the patients with kidney impairment with greater likelihood of having worse outcomes.",

TEG was performed at the time of admission. Creatinine clearance (CCr) was calculated using the Cockroft-Gault equation. Patients were divided into 2 groups based on normal (CCr ≥ 90) or reduced renal function (CCr < 90). Multivariable regression models were conducted to compare the differences of TEG components.\nRESULTS: A total of 120 patients were included in the analysis. The normal CCr group was younger (56.1 versus 62.3 years, P < .01), was more often male (73.6% versus 53.7%, P = .03), and had higher mean admission hemoglobin (14.2 versus 13.2 mEq\/L, P < .01) than the reduced renal function group. The 2 groups were similar with respect to antiplatelet or anticoagulant use, coagulation studies, and baseline ICH volume. Following multivariate analysis, the reduced renal function group was found to have shorter K (1.5 versus 2.2 min, P = 004), increased angle (66 versus 62.2 degrees, P = .04), increased MA (67.3 versus 62.3, P = .02), and increased G (11.3 versus 9.9 dynes\/cm, P = .04) compared with the normal group. Mortality, poor functional outcome (modified Rankin Scale score 4-6), hematoma enlargement, hospital length of stay, and surgical interventions were not different between the 2 groups.\nCONCLUSIONS: Patients with ICH and reduced CCr display faster clotting rate and increased clot strength, suggesting that patients with renal dysfunction present with a relatively hypercoagulable state based on TEG parameters thought to reflect platelet activity.",

According to the recommendations of the European Hernia Society, the treatment of IH in DS units should be performed under Monitored Anesthesia Care (MAC).\nPATIENTS AND METHODS: 960 patients underwent IH repairs over a period of 24 months. The patients were randomly divided into two groups: R (remifentanil) and F (fentanyl); the group F was considered as a control group. The exclusion criteria in both group were: morbid obesity (BMI>40 or BMI>35 in association with high blood pressure or diabetes); coagulopathy; OSAS (obstructive sleep apnea syndrome) with AHI >10; cardiovascular, respiratory, renal, hepatic or metabolic disease; history of substances abuse; GERD-related esophagitis (gastro-esophageal reflux disease); chronic analgesic use; allergy to local anesthetic and ASA>III. Patients reported their level of pain on a verbal numeric scale (VNS), with scores ranging from 0 to 10. For each patient systolic and diastolic blood pressure (SBP and DBP), mean arterial pressure (MAP), heart rate (HR) and peripheral oxygen saturation (SpO2) were recorded. The results are presented as the mean value ± standard deviations; statistical analysis was performed using Student's t-test.\nRESULTS: Amongst the 960 procedures, complications or side effects related to the anesthetic techniques didn't occur; no procedure-related complications requiring mechanical ventilation support were reported. Our research focused on evaluating remifentanil effectiveness in pain control and its impact on hemodynamic stability and respiratory function. There was a significant difference between the two groups with regard to the VNS.\nCONCLUSIONS: Remifentanil, is an excellent drug for pain control during intra-operative procedures, that allows an optimal hemodynamic stability for IH repairs in a DS setting, due to its pharmacokinetic and pharmacodynamic properties and few adverse effects.",

His past medical history included recent percutaneous coronary intervention (PCI) and drug-eluting stent (DES) placement, atrial fibrillation, hypertension, hyperlipidemia, coronary artery disease, coronary artery bypass graft surgery, stage 3 chronic kidney disease, and cholecystectomy. His triple antithrombotic therapy consisted of aspirin, clopidogrel, and dabigatran. The patient stated that his last dose of dabigatran was taken the night before. Serum dabigatran levels were not measured. Due to suspicion of acute upper GI bleeding, all antithrombotic agents were withheld. Treatment with idarucizumab, i.v. pantoprazole, and blood transfusion was ordered. An upper endoscopy was safely performed 24 hours later and revealed a minor Mallory-Weiss tear. The patient was discharged 48 hours later with prescriptions for acid suppressant and triple antithrombotic therapy; his melena had resolved before discharge. At 14-week follow-up, the patient reported that his cardiologist had deleted aspirin from his antithrombotic regimen.\nCONCLUSION: A patient who had recently undergone PCI and DES placement and was receiving aspirin, clopidogrel, and dabigatran for atrial fibrillation was successfully treated for acute GI bleeding with idarucizumab without the use of a hemostatic agent.",

        "Abstract":"BACKGROUND: Bleeding is a well-known complication of percutaneous renal biopsy (PRB). Thus, antiplatelet agents are routinely held for most patients undergoing elective PRB to decrease bleeding risk.\nMATERIALS AND METHODS: In this systematic review, we examine the association between antiplatelet use and bleeding during PRB. MEDLINE and EMBASE were searched from inception to December 2016 using terms that included \"renal biopsy\", \"antiplatelet\",\"aspirin\", and \"bleeding\". Guidelines and systematic reviews were identified primarily through large databases, including the National Guideline Clearinghouse and Cochrane Database of Systematic Reviews. Two authors independently screened the results, and appraised and graded the evidence using the Grading of Recommendations Assessment, Development, and Evaluation (GRADE) approach.\nRESULTS: Out of 371 guidelines, 40 systematic reviews, and 709 primary studies originally identified, 4 guidelines, 1 systematic review, and 2 primary studies met inclusion criteria. The guidelines recommend halting aspirin for elective PRB. The systematic review found no difference in major outcomes for PRB in patients for whom aspirin was continued versus halted, but was of low quality. The 2 nonrandomized primary studies in PRB patients managed with and without aspirin found no difference in major bleeds but a higher risk of minor bleeds.\nCONCLUSIONS: There is low-quality evidence on the effect of aspirin on bleeding risk from PRB. It is reasonable to discontinue aspirin 7 - 10 days prior to nonemergent biopsies, in accordance with guidelines. Given the results from the primary studies, it is reasonable to perform randomized controlled trials to obtain high-quality evidence to inform clinical practice..",

Results were expressed as mean ± SD, percentage and χ-test (significant values when p < .05).\nRESULTS: The prophylactic treatment (60.4% of the patients) significantly controlled the complications related to some risk factors, such as antiphospholipid antibodies (aPL) and nephritis. Preeclampsia occurred in 14.8% of patients. Patients with pregestational hypertension showed a 2.75 odds ratio of adverse events when compared to the group without chronic hypertension. The presence of proteinuria was associated with a risk of preeclampsia 2.45 times greater, as well as serum creatinine >1.2 mg\/dL, which was related to a risk 1.25 times higher than the risk observed in patients with serum creatinine <1.2 mg\/dL. A 6-month inactive disease was associated with a better outcome. A value of Estimated Glomerular Filtration Rate (eGFR) < 90 mL\/min\/1.73 m resulted in a 18.73 times greater risk of preeclampsia, intrauterine growth restriction (IUGR), and preterm delivery.\nDISCUSSION: A multidisciplinary approach in a tertiary care center and a broad prophylactic treatment protocol to patients affected by SLE and complicated by nephritis may definitively foster a successful pregnancy.",

        "Abstract":"BACKGROUND: The effect of uninterrupted oral anticoagulant use in patients with chronic kidney disease (CKD) during catheter ablation for atrial fibrillation (AF) is not fully understood.\nOBJECTIVE: The present study aimed to evaluate the safety and efficacy of periprocedural uninterrupted direct oral anticoagulant (DOAC) use compared with those of uninterrupted warfarin use in patients undergoing catheter ablation for AF stratified by various renal function groups.\nMETHODS: A total of 2091 patients were retrospectively included in this study. The study population was divided into 4 groups: creatinine clearance level ≥80 mL\/min (n = 1086), 50-79 mL\/min (n = 774), 15-49 mL\/min (n = 209), and <15 mL\/min (n = 22). We investigated periprocedural complications and compared them between uninterrupted DOAC and warfarin groups.\nRESULTS: There was no significant difference in thromboembolic events among the 4 groups (0.6%, 0.6%, 1.0%, and 0%, respectively; P = .792). However, major bleeding events (0.9%, 1.4%, 4.8%, and 4.5%; P < .001) and minor bleeding events (4.1%, 6.1%, 11.5%, and 13.6%; P < .001) primarily occurred in patients with CKD. The rate of periprocedural complications in the DOAC group was similar to that in the warfarin group for each renal function category. Adverse events did not differ after adjustment using propensity score-matched analysis. Multivariate analysis showed that lower body weight, antiplatelet drug use, initial ablation session, and CKD were independent predictors of adverse events.\nCONCLUSION: The periprocedural bleeding risk was increased in patients with CKD. Uninterrupted DOAC and warfarin administration during catheter ablation for AF in patients with CKD is feasible and effective.",

        "Abstract":"There are limited real-world data on prevalence and predictors of dual antiplatelet therapy (DAPT) prolongation beyond one year after acute coronary syndrome (ACS). We have explored such issue in the START ANTIPLATELET Registry, which is a prospective, observational, multicenter, Italian registry performed in seven Italian cardiology institutions including patients admitted for ACS and followed up to one year. Out of a total population of 840 ACS patients, 596 patients had completed 12-month follow-up being on DAPT. Decision to prolong DAPT beyond one year was taken in 79 patients (13%), whereas in 517 patients DAPT was stopped. The strongest predictors of DAPT continuation were a new cardiovascular events after the index admission event (OR 3.3, 95% CI 1.4-7.7), no bleeding complications (OR 3.2, 95% CI 1.2-8.3) and no anemia during one-year follow-up (OR 2.6, 95% CI 1.1-5.9); other independent predictors were renal failure (OR 2.5, 95% CI 1.3-5.0) and peripheral artery disease (OR 1.8, 95% CI 1.1-3.0). The choice of DAPT prolongation was not correlated with younger ager, presence of diabetes mellitus, coronary angioplasty as initial treatment strategy or type of implanted stent (drug-eluting vs bare metal). In conclusion, this study provides a real-world snapshot on the factors influencing the option to continue DAPT beyond one year after ACS; a low bleeding risk seems to influence the choice to prolong DAPT more than a high ischemic risk.",

        "Abstract":"Thoracic endovascular aortic repair (TEVAR) is a less invasive option for managing traumatic injuries of the descending aorta in polytraumatized patients. Concerns arise when treating young patients with TEVAR. A 22-year-old male was admitted to the emergency department following a high-impact road traffic collision. Whole-body computed tomography (CT) scan documented multiple injuries, including rupture of descending thoracic aorta just below the isthmus. There was no evidence of paraplegia or stroke. We decided to treat him in an endovascular fashion with a Zenith Cook (Cook Incorporated, Bloomington, IN) endograft. Final angiography confirmed the proper positioning of the device, no infoldings, and the optimal filling of the thoracic aorta downstream of the endoprosthesis. In the postoperative period, the patient showed high blood pressure which was treated with 4 different antihypertensive drugs. He was discharged on cardioaspirine. CT scan control was scheduled after 30 days and 6 months, but he referred to our emergency department after less than 6 months with paraplegia, abdominal pain, and acute renal failure. He had independently discontinued antiplatelet therapy 3 months before. Emergency CT control documented the presence of intimal flap and thrombus at the distal edge of the device. The magnetic resonance imaging revealed ischemic damage of the spinal cord. We decided to reline the endograft using another Zenith Cook device with very good results. Renal failure and bowel pain gradually improved, but paraplegia is still present. TEVAR is the most suitable treatment for blunt thoracic aortic injury in the modern era. Concerns arise from what can happen to a young aorta receiving a stiff endovascular graft that should be carried all lifelong. These devices have been associated with acute hypertension and cardiac remodeling. Less stiffer stent grafts should be studied for young patients. High attention must be posed in the follow-up for the immediate resolution of eventual problems.",

        "Abstract":"BACKGROUND: As high healthcare costs are increasing scrutinized, a movement toward reducing patient hospital admissions and lengths of stay has emerged, particularly for operations that may be performed safely in the outpatient setting. Our aim is to describe recent temporal trends in the proportion of dialysis access procedures performed on an inpatient versus outpatient basis and to determine the effects of these changes on perioperative morbidity and mortality.\nMETHODS: The 2005-2008 American College of Surgeons National Surgical Quality Improvement Program database was queried for all primary arteriovenous fistula (AVF) procedures using current procedural terminology codes. Changes in the proportions of inpatient versus outpatient operations performed by year, as well as the associated 30-day postoperative morbidity and mortality, were analyzed using univariable statistics and multivariable logistic regression.\nRESULTS: Two thousand nine hundred fifty AVF procedures were performed over the study period. Overall, 71.7% (n = 2,114) were performed on an outpatient basis. Inpatient procedures were associated with higher 30-day morbidity (10.5% vs. 4.5%) and mortality (2.8% vs. 0.7%) than outpatient procedures (both, P < 0.001). There was a significant increase in the proportion of procedures performed on an outpatient basis over time (2005: 56% vs. 2008: 75%; P < 0.001). There were no changes in postoperative morbidity or mortality for inpatient or outpatient AVF over time (P ≥ 0.36). Independent determinants of having an inpatient procedure included younger age (OR 0.99), increasing ASA class (ASA IV OR 1.56), congestive heart failure (OR 3.32), recent ascites (OR 3.25), poor functional status (OR 3.22), the presence of an open wound (OR 1.91), and recent sepsis (OR 6.06) (all, P < 0.01). Acute renal failure (OR 2.60) and current dialysis (OR 1.44) were also predictive (P < 0.001). After correcting for baseline differences between groups, the adjusted OR for both morbidity (aOR 1.93, 95% CI 1.38-2.69) and mortality (aOR 2.85, 95% CI 1.36-5.95) remained significantly higher for inpatient versus outpatient AVF.\nCONCLUSIONS: Dialysis access operations are increasingly being performed on an outpatient basis, with stable perioperative outcomes. Inpatient procedures are associated with worse outcomes, likely because they are reserved for patients with acute illnesses, serious comorbidities, and poor functional status. Overall, for appropriately selected patients, the movement toward performing more elective dialysis access operations on an outpatient basis is associated with acceptable outcomes.",

        "Abstract":"OBJECTIVE: Secondary prevention in patients with critical limb ischemia (CLI) is crucial for the reduction of cardiovascular morbidity and mortality. Nonetheless, current recommendations are extrapolated from other high-risk populations because of the lack of CLI-dedicated trials. The aim of this explorative study was to evaluate the association of statin therapy with the outcomes of CLI patients.\nMETHODS: The First-Line Treatments in Patients With Critical Limb Ischemia (CRITISCH) registry is a prospective multicenter registry analyzing the effectiveness of all available treatment strategies in 1200 CLI patients. For the purposes of this analysis, patients were divided into two groups based on statin administration. Treatment crossovers and nonadherent patients were excluded from analysis. The primary composite end point of this study was the amputation-free survival (AFS). Major adverse cardiovascular and cerebral events (MACCEs), time to death, and time to major amputation were also analyzed.\nRESULTS: Statin therapy was applied in 445 individuals (37%), 371 (31%) patients received no statins, and 384 subjects were excluded from analysis (treatment crossovers). Patients receiving statins were more likely to be younger (P < .001) and to have a history of coronary heart disease (P < .001) or previous intervention at index limb (P < .001). Patients receiving statin therapy had a lower hazard regarding AFS (hazard ratio [HR], 0.45; 95% confidence interval [CI], 0.34-0.63; P < .001) and death (HR, 0.40; 95% CI, 0.24-0.66; P < .001) as well as lower odds of MACCE (odds ratio, 0.41; 95% CI, 0.23-0.69; P = .001). However, statin therapy was not associated with reduced amputation rates (HR, 1.02; 95% CI, 0.67-1.56; P = .922). Statin effect on AFS was consistent among diabetics (HR, 0.47; 95% CI, 0.31-0.70; P < .001), patients with chronic kidney disease (HR, 0.53; 95% CI, 0.32-0.87; P = .012), and patients older than 75 years (HR, 0.40; 95% CI, 0.26-0.60; P < .001). Statin administration was also associated with an improved AFS in patients with antiplatelet medication (HR, 0.64; 95% CI, 0.41-0.99; P = .049) and without antiplatelet medication (HR, 0.26; 95% CI, 0.12-0.57; P = .001) and after both endovascular therapy (HR, 0.51; 95% CI, 0.34-0.76; P = .001) and bypass revascularization (HR, 0.38; 95% CI, 0.21-0.68; P = .001).\nCONCLUSIONS: Statin therapy in CLI patients is associated with an increased AFS and lower rates of mortality and MACCEs without improving, however, the salvage rates of the affected limb.",

        "Abstract":"BACKGROUND: Current clinical guidelines of acute coronary syndromes (ACS) recommend the use of potent antiplatelet therapy, prasugrel or ticagrelor, because both drugs consistently reduce cardiovascular events.\nPURPOSE: The aim of this study was to examine temporal changes in the use of optimal antiplatelet therapy in patients with ACS.\nMETHODS: A total of 1717 consecutive patients admitted for ACS in 3 tertiary hospitals from February 2014 to December 2015 were enrolled. We divided these 23 months into 4 semesters: period I (0-5 months), period II (6-11 months), period III (12-17 months), and period IV (17-23 months). Demographic, clinical, and treatment data were collected both at admission and at discharge.\nRESULTS: Treatment with clopidogrel remained constant throughout the periods (52%, 50%, 44%, and 50% for periods I, II, III, and IV, respectively), whereas a progressive increase in ticagrelor treatment was observed (15%, 25%, 26%, and 28%; P = .001). Indeed, new P2Y12 agents showed an increase from 47% at the first semester to 65% in patients with ST-segment elevation myocardial infarction (STEMI), and in patients younger than 75 years from 36% to 53%. However, for patients older than 75 years, diabetic, and patients with end-stage kidney disease, clopidogrel was the second most commonly used antiplatelet agent.\nCONCLUSION: In this real-life registry of patients with ACS, we observed there is still a high rate of use of clopidogrel, despite guidelines recommendations, and our analyses also showed a trend toward the use of ticagrelor. Patients who received new antiplatelet agents were patients with STEMI, younger than 75 years, and with less comorbidities. However, the use of ticagrelor and prasugrel remains low, highlighting a therapeutic inertia with considerable gap between evidence-based clinical guidelines and daily clinical practice.",

        "Published":"2017-08-02",
        "Abstract":"BACKGROUND: Pain is a common feature of childhood and adolescence around the world, and for many young people, that pain is chronic. The World Health Organization guidelines for pharmacological treatments for children's persisting pain acknowledge that pain in children is a major public health concern of high significance in most parts of the world. While in the past pain was largely dismissed and was frequently left untreated, views on children's pain have changed over time, and relief of pain is now seen as important.We designed a suite of seven reviews on chronic non-cancer pain and cancer pain (looking at antidepressants, antiepileptic drugs, non-steroidal anti-inflammatory drugs, opioids, and paracetamol) in order to review the evidence for children's pain utilising pharmacological interventions.As the leading cause of morbidity in the world today, chronic disease (and its associated pain) is a major health concern. Chronic pain (that is pain lasting three months or longer) can arise in the paediatric population in a variety of pathophysiological classifications (nociceptive, neuropathic, or idiopathic) from genetic conditions, nerve damage pain, chronic musculoskeletal pain, and chronic abdominal pain, as well as for other unknown reasons.Non-steroidal anti-inflammatory drugs (NSAIDs) are used to treat pain, reduce fever, and for their anti-inflammation properties. They are commonly used within paediatric pain management. Non-steroidal anti-inflammatory drugs are currently licensed for use in Western countries, however they are not approved for infants under three months old. The main adverse effects include renal impairment and gastrointestinal issues. Common side effects in children include diarrhoea, headache, nausea, constipation, rash, dizziness, and abdominal pain.\nOBJECTIVES: To assess the analgesic efficacy and adverse events of NSAIDs used to treat chronic non-cancer pain in children and adolescents aged between birth and 17 years, in any setting.\nSEARCH METHODS: We searched the Cochrane Central Register of Controlled Trials (CENTRAL) via the Cochrane Register of Studies Online, MEDLINE via Ovid, and Embase via Ovid from inception to 6 September 2016. We also searched the reference lists of retrieved studies and reviews, as well as online clinical trial registries.\nSELECTION CRITERIA: Randomised controlled trials, with or without blinding, of any dose and any route, treating chronic non-cancer pain in children and adolescents, comparing any NSAID with placebo or an active comparator.\nDATA COLLECTION AND ANALYSIS: Two review authors independently assessed studies for eligibility. We planned to use dichotomous data to calculate risk ratio and number needed to treat for one additional event, using standard methods. We assessed GRADE and created three 'Summary of findings' tables.\nMAIN RESULTS: We included seven studies with a total of 1074 participants (aged 2 to 18 years) with chronic juvenile polyarthritis or chronic juvenile rheumatoid arthritis. All seven studies compared an NSAID with an active comparator. None of the studies were placebo controlled. No two studies investigated the same type of NSAID compared with another. We were unable to perform a meta-analysis.Risk of bias varied. For randomisation and allocation concealment, one study was low risk and six studies were unclear risk. For blinding of participants and personnel, three studies were low risk and four studies were unclear to high risk. For blinding of outcome assessors, all studies were unclear risk. For attrition, four studies were low risk and three studies were unclear risk. For selective reporting, four studies were low risk, two studies were unclear risk, and one study was high risk. For size, three studies were unclear risk and four studies were high risk. For other potential sources of bias, seven studies were low risk. Primary outcomesThree studies reported participant-reported pain relief of 30% or greater, showing no statistically significant difference in pain scores between meloxicam and naproxen, celecoxib and naproxen, or rofecoxib and naproxen (P > 0.05) (low-quality evidence).One study reported participant-reported pain relief of 50% or greater, showing no statistically significant difference in pain scores between low-dose meloxicam (0.125 mg\/kg) and high-dose meloxicam (0.25 mg\/kg) when compared to naproxen 10 mg\/kg (P > 0.05) (low-quality evidence).One study reported Patient Global Impression of Change, showing 'very much improved' in 85% of ibuprofen and 90% of aspirin participants (low-quality evidence). Secondary outcomesAll seven studies reported adverse events. Participants reporting an adverse event (one or more per person) by drug were: aspirin 85\/202; fenoprofen 28\/49; ibuprofen 40\/45; indomethacin 9\/30; ketoprofen 9\/30; meloxicam 18\/47; naproxen 44\/202; and rofecoxib 47\/209 (very low-quality evidence).All seven studies reported withdrawals due to adverse events. Participants withdrawn due to an adverse event by drug were: aspirin 16\/120; celecoxib 10\/159; fenoprofen 0\/49; ibuprofen 0\/45; indomethacin 0\/30; ketoprofen 0\/30; meloxicam 10\/147; naproxen 17\/285; and rofecoxib 3\/209 (very low-quality evidence).All seven studies reported serious adverse events. Participants experiencing a serious adverse event by drug were: aspirin 13\/120; celecoxib 5\/159; fenoprofen 0\/79; ketoprofen 0\/30; ibuprofen 4\/45; indomethacin 0\/30; meloxicam 11\/147; naproxen 10\/285; and rofecoxib 0\/209 (very low-quality evidence).There were few or no data for our remaining secondary outcomes: Carer Global Impression of Change; requirement for rescue analgesia; sleep duration and quality; acceptability of treatment; physical functioning as defined by validated scales; and quality of life as defined by validated scales (very low-quality evidence).We rated the overall quality of the evidence (GRADE rating) for our primary and secondary outcomes as very low because there were limited data from studies and no opportunity for a meta-analysis.\nAUTHORS' CONCLUSIONS: We identified only a small number of studies, with insufficient data for analysis.As we could undertake no meta-analysis, we are unable to comment about efficacy or harm from the use of NSAIDs to treat chronic non-cancer pain in children and adolescents. Similarly, we cannot comment on our remaining secondary outcomes: Carer Global Impression of Change; requirement for rescue analgesia; sleep duration and quality; acceptability of treatment; physical functioning; and quality of life.We know from adult randomised controlled trials that some NSAIDs, such as ibuprofen, naproxen, and aspirin, can be effective in certain chronic pain conditions.",

        "Published":null,
        "Abstract":"PURPOSE: To describe the clinical course of advanced juxtapapillary retinal capillary hemangioblastomas (RCH) associated with von Hippel-Lindau (VHL) disease treated with systemic sunitinib malate, an agent that inhibits both anti-vascular endothelial growth factor and anti-platelet-derived growth factor signaling.\nDESIGN: Observational case review.\nPARTICIPANTS: Three patients with advanced VHL-related juxtapapillary RCH treated with systemic sunitinib malate.\nMETHODS: Patient 1 was followed routinely every 4 months while on systemic sunitinib prescribed by her oncologist for metastatic pancreatic neuroendocrine and kidney tumors. Patients 2 and 3 were part of a prospective clinical trial evaluating the use of systemic sunitinib for ocular VHL lesions during a period of 9 months. Visual acuity, size of RCH, and degree of exudation were recorded at each visit. Optical coherence tomography (OCT) and fluorescein angiography were also obtained at some visits.\nMAIN OUTCOME MEASURES: Visual acuity, size of RCH, and degree of exudation.\nRESULTS: Three patients with advanced VHL-associated juxtapapillary RCH were treated with systemic sunitinib malate. While none of the patients lost vision during therapy, treatment with sunitinib malate did not improve visual acuity or reduce the size of RCH. Improvements in RCH-associated retinal edema were observed in two patients. All patients experienced multiple adverse effects, including thyroid toxicity, thrombocytopenia, nausea, fatigue, jaundice, and muscle aches. Two of the three patients had to discontinue treatment prematurely and the third required dose reduction.\nCONCLUSIONS: Systemic sunitinib malate may be useful in slowing progression of ocular disease from VHL-associated RCH. However, significant systemic adverse effects limited its use in this small series, and systemic sunitinib malate may not be safe for treatment of RCH when used at the doses described in this report. Further studies are required to determine if this medication used at lower doses with different treatment strategies, other medications in the same class or drugs directed at multiple targets in the tumor, may be safer and more effective for the treatment of advanced VHL-associated RCH.",

Pump thrombosis in the pediatric CF-VAD population has been reported between 11% and 44%, with the largest reported series from the PediMACS registry reporting a rate of approximately 15%. We report our early experience with four pediatric patients who developed pump thrombosis on a CF-VAD. Our limited experience suggests that the treatment of pediatric VAD thrombosis can be approached with similar principles to the adult population. Our current strategy includes:i. Initiating treatment with bivalirudin for an isolated rise in lactate dehydrogenase (LDH) with no corresponding rapid rise in plasma-free hemoglobin which may prevent further progression.ii. Treatment with a low-dose systemic tissue plasminogen activator (TPA) protocol as opposed to targeted therapy via catheter intervention if bivalirudin fails.iii. If there are concerns with respect to the impact of hemolysis on kidney function or the patient is close to a previous surgery, device exchange can be considered.The balance between achieving appropriate anticoagulation\/antiplatelet therapy in the face of bleeding\/hemorrhagic complications remains a challenge. There is a need for larger studies in the pediatric population to outline an algorithm for the definitive management of VAD thrombosis.",

        "Abstract":"BACKGROUND: In patients ≥80 years of age, the use of second-generation cobalt-chromium everolimus-eluting stents (CoCr-EES) versus bare-metal stents has been shown to reduce myocardial infarction (MI) and target vessel revascularization (TVR) rates, without an increase in bleeding. However, safety and efficacy of CoCr-EES in octogenarians compared to younger populations are less certain. We aimed to compare the clinical outcomes between octogenarian and non-octogenarian patients undergoing percutaneous coronary intervention (PCI) with CoCr-EES.\nMETHODS: We retrospectively analyzed 186 patients treated with CoCr-EES; 54 octogenarians (63 lesions) and 132 non-octogenarians (152 lesions). The primary endpoint was a 1-year composite of all-cause death, MI, TVR, cerebrovascular accident (CVA), or major bleeding. Stent thrombosis (ST) was also evaluated.\nRESULTS: Radial approach was used in 70.4% of octogenarians versus 80.3% of non-octogenarians (p = 0.18). Rates of dual antiplatelet therapy at 1 year were 90.7% for octogenarians and 90.9% for non-octogenarians (p = 1.00). The primary endpoint occurred in 14.8% of octogenarians and 11.4% of non-octogenarians (p = 0.52). There were no significant differences with respect to the rates of 1-year all-cause death (7.4% vs. 3.8%, p = 0.30), MI (1.9% vs. 1.5%, p = 1.00), TVR (3.7% vs. 5.3%, p = 0.65), CVA (1.9% vs. 2.3%, p = 1.00), and definite\/probable ST (1.9% vs. 1.5%, p = 1.00) between the 2 groups. Major bleeding was observed in only 1 of octogenarians. Multivariate analysis demonstrated that chronic kidney disease and intravascular ultrasound use were the only independent predictors of the primary endpoint.\nCONCLUSIONS: According to our series, 1-year safety and efficacy outcomes of CoCr-EES PCI in octogenarians were comparable to those in non-octogenarians.\nSUMMARY: We compared the clinical outcomes between octogenarian and non-octogenarian patients treated with second-generation cobalt-chromium everolimus-eluting stents (CoCr-EES). In our series, 1-year safety and efficacy outcomes of CoCr-EES percutaneous coronary intervention in octogenarians were similar to those in younger counterparts.",

        "Abstract":"BACKGROUND: Estimates of residual cardiovascular risks among patients who have experienced a recent acute myocardial infarction (MI) are predominantly derived from secondary prevention trial populations, patient registries, and population-based cohorts.\nOBJECTIVE: To generate real-world evidence of antiplatelet treatment and recurrent events following MI in patients on antiplatelet treatment among commercial, employer-based insured patients in a large administrative database.\nMETHODS: This was a retrospective cohort claims database study using the Truven Health MarketScan Commercial Claims and Encounters and Medicare Supplemental databases between 2007-2011. Patients with an acute MI hospitalization with a discharge date between 2008 and 2010 were included. Excluded were those patients with documentation of stroke, transient ischemic attack (TIA), or severe bleeding at or before index hospitalization and with concomitant use of anticoagulant therapy following index hospitalization. Patients treated with clopidogrel following the index MI hospitalization were followed up to 1 year for repeat MI, stroke, and coronary revascularization.\nRESULTS: Among 33,943 post-MI continuous clopidogrel users without history of stroke, TIA, or bleeding, 22% had diabetes, whereas angina and renal impairment were less prevalent (5% and 7%, respectively). Over the 1-year follow-up, 2.4% experienced a repeat MI or stroke, and 8.2% underwent coronary revascularization. Angina, diabetes, and renal impairment were associated with elevated 1-year risk of repeat MI or stroke.\nCONCLUSIONS: This study suggests that there is residual cardiovascular risk, although relatively low, in an insured, secondary prevention population on antiplatelet treatment following an MI. In patients with MI, identifying angina, diabetes, and renal impairment may aid risk stratification and guide the effective management of these higher-risk patients.\nDISCLOSURES: Funding for this research was provided by Merck & Co.

        "Published":null,
        "Abstract":"BACKGROUND: Left ventricular assist device-supported patients are usually anticoagulated with a combination of aspirin and vitamin K antagonists. Long-term vitamin K antagonist therapy can be complicated by unstable international normalized ratio values and patient-related compliance problems. Therefore, direct thrombin inhibitors may represent an alternative to vitamin K antagonists.\nMETHODS AND RESULTS: Thirty HeartWare ventricular assist device patients with stable renal function were planned for this prospective, randomized, open-label, single-center study. Patients were randomized to receive either phenprocoumon or dabigatran in addition to aspirin for long-term anticoagulation. Treatment duration was scheduled for 1 year and stopped after observation of a primary end point. Dabigatran dose was 110 and 75 mg BID in patients with normal or impaired renal function (glomerular filtration rate >80 mL\/min or between 80 and 30 mL\/min, respectively). The study was stopped prematurely for safety reasons after 16 patients (61±8 years, 1 female) were randomized. Thromboembolic events occurred in 4 subjects receiving dabigatran (50%) and in 1 receiving phenprocoumon (13%; =0.28). No major bleeding was recorded, and no patient died during the study. Median time to treatment termination was significantly shorter in dabigatran patients (8.5 versus 12.0 months; =0.015).\nCONCLUSIONS: Thromboembolic events on dabigatran led to early termination of a randomized controlled trial of dabigatran versus phenprocoumon in left ventricular assist device patients.\nCLINICAL TRIAL REGISTRATION: https:\/\/www.clinicaltrials.gov.

        "Abstract":"AIM: Numerous geriatric patients develop colorectal disease. Elderly patients are often considered high-risk surgical candidates. Enhanced recovery after surgery (E.R.A.S.) has been proven to be beneficial for patients. The aim of the study was to evaluate the results of an ERAS protocol in older patients that underwent colorectal surgery compared to younger patients.\nMETHOD: In the period between January 2010 to December 2015 a total of 589 patients underwent elective colorectal surgical interventions treated within the E.R.A.S pathway: 211 patients younger than 65 years, 175 patients aged from 66 years to 75 years, and 203 patients older than 75 years. End point of interest were postoperative complications, 90-day mortality, length of hospital stay and readmission within 30 days.\nRESULTS: Significant differences between the three groups were observed for comorbidities (p:0.001); in particular older patients had significantly more diabetes, renal, cardiac, and respiratory diseases, ASA (p < 0.001), presence of malignancy (p < 0.001). However there were not differences between the groups in surgical procedures (p = 0.095), operative time (p = 0.823), anastomotic leakage (p = 0.960), hospital stay (p = 0.081), readmission rate (p = 0.904), 90-days mortality (p = 0.183) and morbidity (p = 0.973) in accordance with Clavien-Dindo classification. Multivariate logistic regression analysis showed that advanced age in E.R.A.S. pathway is not a predictive factor of morbidity, readmission within 30 days and 90-day mortality.\nCONCLUSION: There was no significant difference in morbidity, 90-day mortality, length of stay or readmission rate in patients aged over 75 years compared with younger patients. Old age does not represent a contraindication to the implementation of the E.R.A.S protocol in patients that underwent colorectal surgery. WHAT DOES THIS PAPER ADD TO THE EXISTING LITERATURE?: In the literature there are not many studies that address the impact of older age in the treatment of colorectal disease in an ERAS program. The aging of the population raises new questions in the management of the colorectal surgery in the elderly. ERAS pathway has been proven to be beneficial for patients, which results in a reduction of postoperative morbidity. Compared to what is reported in the literature this study confirms that ERAS program in colorectal surgery can be applied in older patients with no significant difference in morbidity, 90-day mortality, length of stay or readmission rate compared with younger.",

        "Abstract":"BACKGROUND: The aim of this study was to compare the safety and efficacy of RIRS in men ≥65 years to those <65 years.\nMATERIALS AND METHODS: Patients who underwent RIRS were prospectively collected from March 2013 to March 2014 in 5 European centers. Perioperative outcomes and complications in elderly men were compared with men <65 years. Univariable and multivariable analyses were performed for factors predicting overall complications. The groups were compared using Mann-Whitney U test. Categorical variables were compared using chi-squared test and the Yates correction or the Fisher's exact test.\nRESULTS: A total of 399 patients with renal stones were included, 308 (77.19%) were aged <65 years, 91 (22.8%) were aged ≥65 years. Elderly patients were more likely to have higher ASA scores (35.7% vs 92.3%; p < 001), Charlson Comorbidity Index (1.8 vs. 5.2, p < 0.001), hyperlipidemia (10.06% vs. 30.76%; p = 0,0005) and coronary heart disease (5.51% vs. 17.58; p = 0.005) compared to younger cohort.

Comorbid conditions (peptic ulcer, diabetes, liver disease, chronic renal failure, and gastroesophageal reflux disease), concomitant drugs (aspirin, clopidogrel, cilostazol, non-steroidal anti-inflammatory drugs, steroid, anticoagulants, and SSRI), personal habits (smoking, and alcohol consumption) were considered as possible UGIB risk factors. We randomly imputed the prevalence of infection in the data considering the age-specific prevalence of  () infection in Korea. The prevalence of various UGIB risk factors and the age-group specific trend of the prevalence were identified. Prevalence was compared between osteoarthritis patients and others.\nRESULTS: A total of 801926 subjects (93855 osteoarthritis patients) aged 20 and above were included. The prevalence of individual and concurrent multiple risk factors became higher as the age increased. The prevalence of each comorbid condition and concomitant drug were higher in osteoarthritis patients. Thirty-five point zero two percent of the overall population and 68.50% of osteoarthritis patients had at least one or more risk factors of UGIB. The prevalence of individual and concurrent multiple risk factors in younger age groups were also substantial. Furthermore, when personal habits (smoking, and alcohol consumption) and  infection were included, the prevalence of concurrent multiple risk factors increased greatly even in younger age groups.\nCONCLUSION: Prevalence of UGIB risk factors was high in elderly population, but was also considerable in younger population. Patient with osteoarthritis was at higher UGIB risk than those without osteoarthritis. Physicians should consider individualized risk assessment regardless of age when prescribing drugs or performing procedures that may increase the risk of UGIB, and take necessary measures to reduce modifiable risk factors such as  eradication or lifestyle counseling.",

Data collected from the electronic health record included patient demographics, renal function, inpatient aspirin, P2Y12 inhibitor and\/or nonsteroidal antiinflammatory drug (NSAID) use, type of surgery, postoperative analgesia, and presence of VTE risk factors. Adjusted incidence rate ratio for bleeding or VTE events was estimated using modified Poisson regression with robust standard errors. Covariates included in a multivariable model were age, sex, aspirin use, P2Y12 inhibitor use, NSAID use, obesity, VTE risk factors, and creatinine clearance.\nRESULTS: There were 3246 patients who met study inclusion criteria. Overall, incidences of bleeding and VTE events were rare. Bleeding event incidence ranged from 0.4% in the warfarin and warfarin with the addition of enoxaparin groups to 1.2% in the rivaroxaban group (p=0.088). There were two major bleeding events and 18 minor bleeding events (including hemorrhagic wound complications).

        "Abstract":"BACKGROUND: Synthetic cannabinoids are swiftly gaining popularity and have earned a reputation of being relatively safer than other illicit drugs. However, there is a growing body of literature associating thromboembolic events with their use.\nCASE REPORT: A 32-year-old woman presented on four separate occasions with a new thromboemoblic event after smoking synthetic cannabinoids. She had no medical history, and over the span of 9 months she developed two kidney infarcts, pulmonary emboli, and an ischemic stroke. Each of these events occurred within 24 hours of smoking synthetic cannabinoids. During periods of abstinence, she remained free of thrombotic events. WHY SHOULD AN EMERGENCY PHYSICIAN BE AWARE OF THIS?: This report shows that an association between thrombosis and the use of synthetic cannabinoids is reproducible and involves both venous and arterial thrombosis, suggesting activation of coagulation or inflammatory pathways. As the popularity of this drug continues to grow, we can expect to see a growing number of these cases. Synthetic cannabinoid use should be included in the differential diagnosis of young patients with no risk factors who present with venous or arterial thrombosis.",

        "Abstract":"BACKGROUND AND PURPOSE: Patients with chronic kidney disease (CKD) are at a particularly high risk for ischemic and bleeding events. Limited data exist as to the efficacy and safety of clopidogrel in stroke patients with renal dysfunction. Therefore, we sought to assess the impact of decreased kidney function on clinical outcomes for stroke patients on clopidogrel-aspirin treatment.\nMETHODS: Patients in the CHANCE trial (Clopidogrel in High-Risk Patients With Acute Nondisabling Cerebrovascular Events) were randomized to clopidogrel-aspirin or aspirin-alone treatment. The primary efficacy outcome was new stroke during 90 days, whereas bleeding was the safety outcome. Patients were stratified according to estimated glomerular filtration rate.\nRESULTS: Dual clopidogrel-aspirin therapy was associated with a marked reduction in new strokes compared with the therapy of aspirin alone in patients with normal renal function (hazard ratio, 0.77; 95% confidence interval, 0.60-0.98; P=0.02) and mild CKD (hazard ratio, 0.60; 95% confidence interval, 0.45-0.79; P<0.01), whereas in patients with moderate CKD, no significant benefit from clopidogrel therapy was detected (hazard ratio, 1.00; 95% confidence interval, 0.43-2.35; P=0.99). There was no clear difference in bleeding episodes by treatment assignment across categories of renal impairment.\nCONCLUSIONS: Clopidogrel plus aspirin could decrease new stroke in patients with normal kidney function and mild CKD, but no extra benefit was observed in those with moderate CKD. Bleeding risk from the dual therapy did not seem to increase in mild or moderate CKD patients.\nCLINICAL TRIAL REGISTRATION: URL: http:\/\/www.clinicaltrials.gov. Unique identifier: NCT00979589.",

        "Abstract":"A growing number of children globally are being treated for multidrug-resistant tuberculosis (MDR-TB). The second-line injectable antituberculosis medications amikacin, kanamycin and capreomycin, traditionally a mainstay of MDR-TB treatment, cause important adverse effects including permanent sensorineural hearing loss, nephrotoxicity, electrolyte abnormalities, injection pain and local injection site complications. Areas covered: To characterize the safety and tolerability of the second-line injectables in children treated for MDR-TB, we reviewed data on the mechanism of injectable associated adverse effects, risk factors for their development, and the incidence of injectable-associated adverse effects in adults and children treated for MDR-TB. Expert opinion: Despite a substantial evidence base in adults demonstrating the frequent and potentially serious adverse effects of second-line injectables, important knowledge gaps remain. Improved characterization of the incidence of injectable-associated adverse effects will inform rational guidance on monitoring children with TB on injectables. Eliminating the need for injectables in MDR-TB treatment regimens is a high priority, and will rely on the use of novel antituberculosis TB drugs. Strategies to reduce the risk of adverse effects of injectables, if used, deserve evaluation. This includes evaluation of potentially otoprotective medications N-acetylcysteine or aspirin, high frequency hearing screening for earlier detection of ototoxicity and therapeutic drug monitoring.",

        "Abstract":"Lipoprotein(a) [Lp(a)] is an apolipoprotein(a) molecule bound to 1 apolipoprotein B-100. Elevated levels of Lp(a) are thought to be an independent risk factor for atherosclerosis and to promote thrombosis through incompletely understood mechanisms. We report a 34-year-old man with an ischemic stroke in the setting of an extremely high Lp(a) level-212 mg\/dL. He developed severe carotid artery stenosis over a 6-year period and had thrombus formation post-carotid endarterectomy. To our knowledge, this case is unique because the Lp(a) is the highest reported level in a patient without renal disease. Moreover, this is the first reported case of the youngest individual with a stroke presumably related to development of carotid plaque over a 6-year period. The thrombotic complication after endarterectomy may have been related to the prothrombotic properties of Lp(a). Of note, the Lp(a) level did not respond to atorvastatin but did decrease 15% after aspirin 325 mg was added although his Lp(a) levels were variable, and it is not clear that this was cause and effect. This case highlights the need to better understand the relation between Lp(a) and vascular disease and the need to screen family members for elevated Lp(a). We also review treatment options to lower Lp(a) and ongoing clinical trials of newer lipid-lowering drugs that can also lower Lp(a).",

        "Abstract":"The administration of antiplatelet drugs for months after a drug-eluting stent implantation is critical in decreasing the risk of complications, and premature discontinuation of antiplatelet therapy before the recommended period is the most important predictor for late complications. Therefore, we investigated the prevalence and associated factors of premature discontinuation of antiplatelet therapy in patients in Korea. This retrospective cohort study was conducted using the Korean National Health Insurance Service-National Sample Cohort data. Patients who were treated with dual-antiplatelet therapy (DAPT) were identified with medication prescription data. The Kaplan-Meier failure time plot was used to illustrate the cumulative probability of treatment discontinuation. Cox regression analysis was conducted to compare predictors of early discontinuation of DAPT. The characteristics of the early discontinuation group were not significantly different from the guideline concordance group, except for a higher prevalence of disability and a lower rate of chronic kidney disease. In a Cox regression model, the presence of hypertension was identified as a negative predictor of early discontinuation, and disability was not a statistically significant predictor. The prevalence of early discontinuation was 31.0% and seems to be significantly higher than those reported from prospective studies, which may more accurately reflect the real-world situation. In conclusion, physicians should make more effort to educate patients on the risk associated with premature discontinuation of antiplatelet therapy after percutaneous coronary intervention with drug-eluting stent, and further studies investigating the reasons for nonadherence of DAPT are needed to improve DAPT compliance.",

Safety in patients with pulmonary hypertension is controversial and many bronchoscopists consider this as a contraindication for the procedure.\nOBJECTIVES: To evaluate safety of bronchoscopy in patients with echocardiographic pulmonary hypertension and to compare with patients without it.\nMETHODS: Retrospective analysis of patients who underwent bronchoscopic transbronchial biopsy, endobronchial biopsy and\/or endobronchial ultrasound-guided transbronchial needle aspiration. Patients were divided into two groups based on echocardiographic results: control group with systolic pulmonary artery pressure <36 and a group with elevated systolic pulmonary artery pressure (eSPAP) ≥36.\nRESULTS: One-hundred and ninety patients met the study criteria. Patients in the control group were younger with a lower incidence of chronic kidney disease. There was no difference in prevalence of congestive heart failure, obstructive airway disease, malignancy, liver disease, coagulopathy, use of antiplatelet agent or anticoagulant drugs. Incidence of minor bleeding due to bronchoscopic biopsies was 4.8% in both groups (p = 1.00). Incidence of major bleeding was similar in the groups (one patient in each group). In the control group, one patient had pneumothorax and another required prolonged mechanical ventilation (>4 h). In the eSPAP group, two patients required prolonged mechanical ventilation. There was no procedure-related mortality or sedation complications in the cohort.\nCONCLUSION: Our study provides additional support that in patients with echocardiographic evidence of pulmonary hypertension, transbronchial and endobronchial biopsies and endobronchial ultrasound-guided transbronchial needle aspiration are safe procedures.",

In 1980 s, the relevance of aspirin for Reye's syndrome became a problem, then acetaminophen came into use for various kinds of cases such as children, pregnant women and the elderly for pain management or alleviation of fever. However, because acetaminophen has a very weak COX-1 and COX-2 inhibitory effect it has weak or no anti-inflam- matory effect Therefore physicians do not wish to use acetaminophen for management of pain in which in- flammation is thought to be the main mechanism. But recently acetaminophen has become reevaluated as an indication for patients with chronic pain. In 2011, the maximum daily dose of acetaminophen in Japan was increased from 1,500 ng - day-- to 4,000 mg - day-1 (international dosage). As acetaminophen has few side effects of gastrointestinal and renal systems, its use is recommended for the control of long term pain man- agement The side effects of acetaminophen and their management are discussed.",

The exclusion criteria include salvage cases, a history of coagulopathy in the family, and long-term use of anticoagulation or antiplatelet drugs.\nINTERVENTIONS: Sixty patients were divided randomly into a control group (n = 30) receiving a traditional heparin regimen and an experimental group (n = 30) receiving an adjusted regimen.\nMEASUREMENTS AND MAIN RESULTS: Activated coagulation time (ACT) was monitored at different time points, ACT>480 seconds was set as the safety threshold of CPB. Heparin doses (initial dose, added dose, and total dose), protamine doses (initial dose, added dose, and total dose), CPB time, aortic clamping time, assisted circulation time, sternal closure time, blood transfusion volume, and drainage volume 24 hours after surgery were recorded. There was no significant difference in achieving target ACT after the initial dose of heparin between the 2 groups; CPB time, aortic clamping time, assisted circulation time, postoperative complication rate, and drainage volume between the 2 groups were not significantly different (p>0.05). However, initial and total dosage of heparin, initial and total dosage of protamine, sternal closure time, and intraoperative blood transfusion volume in the experimental group were significantly lower (p< 0.05).\nCONCLUSIONS: Adjusted regimen of heparin infusion could be used safely and effectively in Chinese CPB patients, which might reduce the initial and total dosage of heparin and protamine as well as sternal closure time and intraoperative blood transfusion volume.",

        "Abstract":"Background Oral anticoagulant therapy is indicated for the prevention of stroke or other thromboembolic events. Premature discontinuation of oral anticoagulants may increase the risk of thromboembolism resulting in adverse sequelae. There are sparse data on the prevalence and the predictors of dabigatran discontinuation in Malaysian patients with atrial fibrillation. Objectives Determine the reasons and identify associated factors for abrupt discontinuation of dabigatran, assess the switching pattern and the occurrence of thromboembolic events after dabigatran discontinuation. Setting A university-affiliated tertiary hospital in Kuala Lumpur, Malaysia. Methods The clinical and demographic data of a cohort who were initiated with dabigatran between 2010 and 2012 at the University of Malaya Medical Centre were reviewed until the date of death or on 31st December 2013. Those patients who discontinued dabigatran were further followed up until 31st December 2015 to determine the occurrence of any thromboembolic event. Main outcome measure Permanent discontinuation of dabigatran for more than 8 weeks. Results 26 (14 %) of a cohort of 192 patients discontinued dabigatran therapy during a median follow-up period of 20 (range 3-45) months. About one-half of the discontinuation occurred within the first 6 months of dabigatran use. The three most cited reasons for discontinuation are bleeding events (19 %), high out-of-pocket drug payment (19 %) and cardioversion (19 %). Heart failure [adjusted odds ratio 3.699 (95 % confidence interval 1.393-9.574)] or chronic kidney disease [adjusted odds ratio 5.211 (95 % confidence interval 1.068-23.475)] were found to be independent risk factors for abrupt dabigatran discontinuation. Patients who discontinued dabigatran received warfarin (38 %), antiplatelet agents (16 %) or no alternative antithrombotic therapy (46 %). Five of the 26 patients who discontinued dabigatran developed an ischaemic stroke within 3-34 months after discontinuation. Conclusion Abrupt dabigatran discontinuation without an alternative oral anticoagulant increases the risk of thromboembolic events. As adverse drug events and renal impairment contribute substantially to the premature discontinuation of dabigatran, it is important to identify and monitor patients at risk to reduce dabigatran discontinuation rate especially during the first six months of dabigatran therapy.",

The SFR and CR of obese patients were compared to overweight and normal weight patients.\nRESULTS: Mean age was 52.51 years and the average BMI 27.74 kg\/m. Of the patients, 34.2 % had normal weight (22.59 ± 1.91 kg\/m), 39.6 % were overweight (27.30 ± 1.42 kg\/m), and 26.3 % were obese (35.09 ± 5.93 kg\/m).

Arch surgery was defined as a procedure requiring circumferential anastomosis at the level of the aortic arch or the descending aorta with the use of techniques of brain protection (deep hypothermic circulatory arrest [DHCA] or selective antegrade cerebral perfusion [SACP]) and\/or debranching of at least one supra-aortic vessel.\nRESULTS: Men predominated in both groups (> 70%). Men were younger in the emergency group (55 vs. 66 years; p < 0.008). The operative risk was higher in the emergency group (19.2% vs. 12.5%; p < 0.001). Forty-nine per cent of the patients from the emergency group and 5% from the elective group were operated with antiplatelet therapy (p < 0.001). Extended hemiarch procedure was performed in 79% (n = 77) in the emergency and 76% (n = 57) in the elective group. Total arch replacement was performed in 19 (21%) patients from the emergency and 18 (24%) patients from the elective group. In these patients debranching was performed in 68% of the emergency patients group and in 67% of the elective group. Elephant trunk procedure (classic\/frozen) was performed in 53% (n = 10) from the emergency and in 78% (n = 14) of patients from the elective group. Aortic valve sparing surgery was performed in 20% of patients from the emergency and 9% from the elective group (p = 0.063). DHCA was performed in 58% (n = 43) of patients from the elective group and 39% (n = 37) from the emergency group. SACP was performed in 61% (n = 58) of patients from the emergency and 42% (n = 31) from the elective group. Thirty-day mortality in the emergency group reached 33% (n = 32), and in the elective group 15% (n = 11; p = 0.007). In multivariate analysis, predictors of death in the emergency group were: Logistic EuroSCORE above 19.5%, extracorporeal circulation time above 228 min, and postoperative acute renal failure (ARF); and in the elective group: DHCA time above 26 min, rethoracotomy due to bleeding, and ARF. Follow-up was completed in 100% of patients in terms of vital status. The mean follow-up time of the patients from the emergency group was 24.3 ± 27.10 (min 0, max 92) months, and from the elective group 30.3 ± 24.5 (min 0, max 99) months. During the follow-up period all-cause mortality in the emergency group was 43% (n = 42\/97), and in the elective group it was 36% (n = 27\/75).\nCONCLUSIONS: Early mortality in the emergency group was higher, while long-term mortality did not differ among the groups.

        "Abstract":"OBJECTIVE: To assess the efficacy and safety of Retrograde Intrarenal Surgery to treat renal stones in patients with different American Society of Anesthesia (ASA) physical status.\nMATERIAL AND METHODS: We performed a retrospective analysis of 150 patients who underwent Retrograde Intrarenal Surgery for renal stone between October 2013 and December 2014. Patients were categorized into three groups according to their ASA physical status: ASA Class 1 (Group 1, n = 23), ASA Class 2 (Group 2, n = 113) and ASA Class 3 (Group 3, n = 14). We documented and stratified the per-operative and postoperative complications according to modified Satava Classification System and Clavien-Dindo Classification.\nRESULTS: The mean age of the patients was 44 years. The total stone-free rate was 81.2%. According to the groups, the stone-free rate was 75% in Group 1, 82.5% in Group 2, and 83.3% in Group 3 (p   =   0.340). Per-operative and postoperative complications were recorded in 12% (n = 18) and 5.3% (n = 8) of the patients. We did not find significant difference in terms of per-operative and postoperative complication rates among patients with different ASA physical status (p(per-operative) = 0.392 and p(postoperative) = 0.136).\nCONCLUSIONS: Retrograde Intrarenal Surgery is an effective and safe surgery with high stone-free rates and low morbidity in patients with different ASA physical status.",

        "Abstract":"In women with preexisting diabetes and nephropathy or microalbuminuria, it is important to deliver careful preconception counselling to assess the risk for the mother and the foetus, for optimizing glycaemic status and to adjust medical treatment. If serum creatinine is normal in early pregnancy, kidney function is often preserved during pregnancy, but complications such as severe preeclampsia and preterm delivery are still common. Perinatal mortality is now comparable with that in women with diabetes and normal kidney function. Besides strict glycaemic control before and during pregnancy, early and intensive antihypertensive treatment is important to optimize pregnancy outcomes. Methyldopa, labetalol, nifedipine and diltiazem are considered safe, whereas angiotensin-converting enzyme (ACE) inhibitors or angiotensin receptor blockers should be stopped before or at confirmation of pregnancy. Supplementation with folic acid in early pregnancy and low-dose aspirin from 10 to 12 weeks reduces the risk of adverse pregnancy outcomes. During breastfeeding, several ACE inhibitors are considered safe.",

        "Abstract":"BACKGROUND AND AIMS: Nephrotoxicity is a rare idiosyncratic reaction to 5-aminosalicylate (5-ASA) therapies. The aims of this study were to describe the clinical features of this complication and identify clinically useful genetic markers so that these drugs can be avoided or so that monitoring can be intensified in high-risk patients.\nMETHODS: Inflammatory bowel disease patients were recruited from 89 sites around the world. Inclusion criteria included normal renal function prior to commencing 5-ASA, ≥50% rise in creatinine any time after starting 5-ASA, and physician opinion implicating 5-ASA strong enough to justify drug withdrawal. An adjudication panel identified definite and probable cases from structured case report forms. A genome-wide association study was then undertaken with these cases and 4109 disease controls.\nRESULTS: After adjudication, 151 cases of 5-ASA-induced nephrotoxicity were identified. Sixty-eight percent of cases were males, with nephrotoxicity occurring at a median age of 39.4 years (range 6-79 years). The median time for development of renal injury after commencing 5-ASA was 3.0 years (95% confidence interval [CI] 2.3-3.7). Only 30% of cases recovered completely after drug withdrawal, with 15 patients requiring permanent renal replacement therapy. A genome-wide association study identified a suggestive association in the HLA region (p = 1×10(-7)) with 5-ASA-induced nephrotoxicity. A sub-group analysis of patients who had a renal biopsy demonstrating interstitial nephritis (n = 55) significantly strengthened this association (p = 4×10(-9), odds ratio 3.1).\nCONCLUSIONS: This is the largest and most detailed study of 5-ASA-induced nephrotoxicity to date. It highlights the morbidity associated with this condition and identifies for the first time a significant genetic predisposition to drug-induced renal injury.",

        "Published":"2015-10-22",
        "Abstract":"BACKGROUND: In contrast to the vast majority of pharmaceuticals on the market, antiplatelet agents are widely prescribed in a uniform, 'one size fits all' manner, without conventional dose adjustments. However, strong evidence yielded from clinical trials repeatedly suggests that patients with a low body weight (LBW), the elderly and those with renal or hepatic impairment may benefit from reduced doses, while younger, heavier patients, males and diabetics may benefit from a dose escalation. Vorapaxar, a thrombin protease-activated receptor-1 inhibitor, has been tested in the TRA2P and TRACER clinical trials, but its efficacy and safety in patients with a LBW is unclear.\nOBJECTIVE: To determine the impact of LBW on primary end point rates (PER) and bleeding risk after vorapaxar, as yielded from the TRA2P and TRACER secondary FDA review.\nRESULTS: The LBW (<60 kg) groups in TRA2P (n = 1,852; 7%) and TRACER (n = 1,046; 8%) were small. However, the PER repeatedly suggested inferiority of vorapaxar over placebo in both the successful TRA2P study (10.6 vs. 8.4%; p = 0.012) and the failed TRACER study (19.3 vs. 18.2%; p = not significant). In TRA2P, the PER monotonically escalated with increasing weight for placebo, while those in the vorapaxar arm formed a flat U- or J-shaped distribution across the weight quintiles. In TRACER, the PER by weight quintile appear much higher, but also more random than in TRA2P. The bleeding rates in TRA2P were higher for the 2 lowest-weight quintiles with both placebo and vorapaxar. In TRACER, bleeding rates were more than doubled when compared to TRA2P, and they varied little by weight quintile, with a slight decrease for the heaviest patients in the placebo population and being the highest in the 2 lowest-weight quintiles after vorapaxar.\nCONCLUSION: The FDA analyses revealed no definite proof that LBW is associated with reduced efficacy of vorapaxar. While these data are striking, they can be explained by better outcomes in LBW placebo patients already sufficiently treated with dual-antiplatelet therapy. In contrast to efficacy, both TRA2P and TRACER definitely suggest that bleeding rates after vorapaxar are higher in patients with LBW. Dose adjustment for antiplatelet agents may soon become a reality.",

        "Abstract":"Greater antithrombotic potency new antiplatelet agents have been added such as prasugrel (PR) and ticagrelor to the traditional use of clopidogrel (CL) in the treatment of acute coronary syndrome (ACS). This study was aimed at comparing the incidence of long term ischemic and hemorrhagic events in patients treated with CL or PR during hospitalization. Retrospective ACS data base analysis performed by our cardiology service was completed prospectively. There were consecutively included all patients with percutaneous coronary intervention (PCI) during hospitalization due to ACS from December 2011 thru December 2012. A total of 398 ACS patients who underwent PCI with stent implantation were recruited. No differences in cardiovascular related deaths were observed in both groups (PR 2.9% vs. CL 2.5%, p=0.48). PR group showed less re-infraction (1.9% vs. 6.8%, p=0.01) with more total bleedings (18.5% vs. 8.5%, p=0.001) and minor bleedings (12.4% vs. 3.4%, p<0.001) with no differences in major and life threatening bleedings (p=ns). Multivariate analysis showed that independent predictors of cardiovascular mortality were age (OR 1.08, CI 95% 1.02-1.16) and renal failure (OR 6.98, CI 95% 1.23-39.71). Independent predictors for total bleeding were age (OR 1.06, CI 95% 1.02-1.09),ST segment elevation myocardial infarction (OR 1.99, CI 95% 1.05-3.79), renal failure (OR 3.32, CI 95% 1.62-6.78) and prasugrel use (OR 3.97, CI 95% 1.87-8.41). Use of prasugrel, in the ACS that requires PCI with stent, is associated with a lower myocardial infarction a year after follow-up, and it also leads to an increase of milder hemorrhage. No significant differences were observed in the cardiovascular mortality of both groups.",

Few studies have focused on CI-AKI in elderly patients with acute coronary syndrome (ACS).\nMETHODS: We compare the incidence of CI-AKI in patients <75 and ≥75 years enrolled in the Protective effect of Rosuvastatin and Antiplatelet Therapy On contrast-induced acute kidney injury and myocardial damage in patients with ACS (PRATO-ACS) study and explore the impact of high-dose rosuvastatin on CI-AKI and clinical outcomes in the 2 age-groups. Statin-naive patients with non-ST-segment elevation ACS scheduled for early invasive strategy (total 504) were randomized to rosuvastatin (40 mg on admission followed by 20 mg\/day) or no statin treatment. Contrast-induced acute kidney injury was defined as creatinine increase ≥0.5 mg\/dL or ≥25% above baseline within 72 hours after contrast administration. All patients were stratified in tertiles according to baseline high-sensitivity C-reactive protein (hs-CRP).\nRESULTS: Rate of CI-AKI was significantly higher in patients ≥75 years (15.9% vs 8.7%, odds ratio: 2.001; 95% confidence interval: 1.14-3.53, P = .015). No significant interaction was observed between age and statin treatment (P = .17).

        "Abstract":"BACKGROUND: The aim of this study was to identify the predictive factors for the development of type II endoleaks (EL-II) after endovascular aneurysm repair (EVAR).\nMETHODS: We assessed the preoperative and postoperative computed tomography data of 308 patients who underwent EVAR between 2000 and 2012 and in 84 of whom primary or secondary EL-II occurred. The data analyzed were: demographics, number and diameter of lumbar arteries (LAs), inferior mesenteric artery (IMA), median sacral artery (MSA), accessory renal arteries (ARas), maximum diameter of infrarenal abdominal aortic aneurysm, diameter and length of proximal aortic neck. Statistical analysis was performed using Stata software (version 12). Categorical parameters were compared between groups using chi-squared or Fisher's exact tests as appropriate. Continuous variables were analyzed using Student's t-test or Mann-Whitney test as appropriate (normality studied by the Shapiro-Wilk and homoscedasticity verified using the Fisher-Snedecor test).\nRESULTS: Of the 308 patients included (mean age, 73.8 ± 8.74 years), 284 (92%) were men, 61 (20%) were smokers, 113 (37%) had chronic obstructive pulmonary disease, 215 (70%) were taking antiplatelet. Respectively, 13, 51, 60, 103, 28, 40, 2, and 7 patients had 1, 2, 3, 4, 5, 6, 7, and 8 patent LAs. Before surgery, 221 IMAs and 136 MSA were patent. The sources of EL-II were: LA (n = 51), IMA (n = 22), MSA (n = 1), IMA and LA (n = 8), IMA and ARa (n = 1), and unknown (n = 1). Logistic regression models adjusting for clinically relevant covariables (age, American Society of Anesthesiologists, smoking status, dyslipidemia, and diuretics) were proposed to study morphologic EL-II predictive factors, first in the entire population, and then in the more specific population for whom IMA was patent. Risk factors of occurrence EL-II were: permeability of the IMA (70 patients [83%] vs. 155 [69%], P = 0.01), IMA diameter (3.49 mm vs. 2.71 mm, P < 0.001), number of LAs patent higher than or equal to 4 (P < 0.001), the mean LA diameter greater than 2.4 mm (P < 0.001), and MSA diameter (2.28 mm vs. 1.94 mm; P < 0.01).\nCONCLUSIONS: Our results show the major role of the number and diameter of the patent aortic branches in the development of EL-II. As they can result in complications increasing the morbidity and mortality after EVAR, it is relevant to identify the risk factors of their occurrence.",

        "Abstract":"The relationship between type 2 diabetes and gout is complex. The objective of this study was to understand the role of diabetes itself and its comorbidities within the association between type 2 diabetes and gout.We conducted a retrospective cohort study using the UK Clinical Practice Research Datalink (CPRD) GOLD. Persons with type 2 diabetes were identified as persons on a noninsulin antidiabetic drug (NIAD) between 2004 and 2012, and were matched to 1 control based on age, sex, and general practice. We estimated gout risk in NIAD users using Cox regression analysis. All analyses were stratified for sex.In total, 221,117 NIAD users were identified. NIAD users had an increased risk of gout (hazard ratio (HR) 1.48; 95% CI 1.41-1.54). This association was stronger in women (HR 2.23; 95% CI 2.07-2.41) compared with men (HR 1.19; 95% CI 1.13-1.26). After adjustments for BMI, eGFR, hypertension, renal transplantation, diuretics, statins, low-dose aspirin, ciclosporin, and tacrolimus, the risk disappeared in women (HR 1.01; 95% CI 0.92-1.11) and reversed in men (HR 0.61; 95% CI 0.58-0.66) (P for interaction <0.001). When stratifying gout risk according to HbA1c in male and female NIAD users, we found an inverse association between raising HbA1c and incident gout in men only. Further adjustment gave similar results.Individuals with type 2 diabetes are at increased risk of gout. This is not due to diabetes itself, but to the comorbid conditions. Diabetes itself is apparently associated with a decreased risk of gout, especially in men.",

        "Published":"2015-08-07",
        "Abstract":"BACKGROUND: Henoch-Schönlein purpura (HSP) is the most common vasculitis of childhood but may occur in adults. This small vessel vasculitis is characterised by palpable purpura, abdominal pain, arthritis or arthralgia and kidney involvement. This is an update of a review first published in 2009.\nOBJECTIVES: To evaluate the benefits and harms of different agents (used singularly or in combination) compared with placebo, no treatment or any other agent for: (1) the prevention of severe kidney disease in patients with HSP without kidney disease at presentation; (2) the prevention of severe kidney disease in patients with HSP and minor kidney disease (microscopic haematuria, mild proteinuria) at presentation; (3) the treatment of established severe kidney disease (macroscopic haematuria, proteinuria, nephritic syndrome, nephrotic syndrome with or without acute kidney failure) in HSP; and (4) the prevention of recurrent episodes of HSP-associated kidney disease.\nSEARCH METHODS: We searched the Cochrane Kidney and Transplant's Specialised Register to 13 July 2015 through contact with the Trials Search Co-ordinator using search terms relevant to this review.\nSELECTION CRITERIA: Randomised controlled trials (RCTs) comparing interventions used to prevent or treat kidney disease in HSP compared with placebo, no treatment or other agents were included.\nDATA COLLECTION AND ANALYSIS: Two authors independently determined study eligibility, assessed risk of bias and extracted data from each study. Statistical analyses were performed using the random effects model and the results were expressed as risk ratio (RR) or risk difference (RD) for dichotomous outcomes and mean difference (MD) for continuous outcomes with 95% confidence intervals (CI).\nMAIN RESULTS: Thirteen studies (1403 enrolled patients) were identified. Risks of bias attributes were frequently poorly performed. Low risk of bias was reported in six studies (50%) for sequence generation (selection bias) and in seven (58%) for allocation concealment (selection bias). Blinding of participants and personnel (performance bias) and of outcome assessment (detection bias) was at low risk of bias in three studies. Five studies reported complete outcome data (attrition bias) while eight studies reported expected outcomes so were at low risk of reporting bias.Eight studies evaluated therapy to prevent persistent kidney disease in HSP. There was no significant difference in the risk of persistent kidney disease any time after treatment (5 studies, 746 children: RR 0.74, 95% CI 0.42 to 1.32), or at one, three, six and 12 months in children given prednisone for 14 to 28 days at presentation of HSP compared with placebo or supportive treatment. There were no significant differences in the risk of persistent kidney disease with antiplatelet therapy in children with or without kidney disease at entry. Heparin significantly reduced the risk of persistent kidney disease by three months compared with placebo (1 study, 228 children: RR 0.27, 95% CI 0.14 to 0.55); no significant bleeding occurred. Four studies examined the treatment of severe HSP-associated kidney disease. Two studies (one involving 56 children and the other involving 54 adults) compared cyclophosphamide with placebo or supportive treatment and found no significant benefit of cyclophosphamide. There were no significant differences in adverse effects. In one study comparing cyclosporin with methylprednisolone (15 children) there was no significant difference in remission at final follow-up at a mean of 6.3 years (RR 1.37, 95% CI 0.74 to 2.54). In one study (17 children) comparing mycophenolate mofetil with azathioprine, there was no significant difference in the remission of proteinuria at one year (RR 1.32, 95% CI 0.86 to 2.03). No studies were identified which evaluated the efficacy of therapy on kidney disease in participants with recurrent episodes of HSP.\nAUTHORS' CONCLUSIONS: There are no substantial changes in conclusions from this update compared with the initial review. From generally low quality evidence, we found no evidence of benefit from RCTs for the use of prednisone or antiplatelet agents to prevent persistent kidney disease in children with HSP. Though heparin appeared effective, this potentially dangerous therapy is not justified to prevent serious kidney disease when fewer than 2% of children with HSP develop severe kidney disease. No evidence of benefit has been found for cyclophosphamide treatment in children or adults with HSP and severe kidney disease. Because of small patient numbers and events leading to imprecision in results, it remains unclear whether cyclosporin and mycophenolate mofetil have any roles in the treatment of children with HSP and severe kidney disease.",

        "Abstract":"AIM: The Fish oils and Aspirin in Vascular access OUtcomes in REnal Disease (FAVOURED) trial investigated whether 3 months of omega-3 polyunsaturated fatty acids, either alone or in combination with aspirin, will effectively reduce primary access failure of de novo arteriovenous fistulae. This report presents the baseline characteristics of all study participants, examines whether study protocol amendments successfully increased recruitment of a broader and more representative haemodialysis cohort, including patients already receiving aspirin, and contrasts Malaysian participants with those from Australia, New Zealand and the United Kingdom (UK).\nMETHOD: This international, randomized, double-blind, placebo-controlled trial included patients older than 19 years with stage 4 or 5 chronic kidney disease currently receiving, or planned within 12 months to receive haemodialysis.\nRESULTS: Participants (n = 568) were overweight (28.6 ± 7.3 kg\/m(2) ), relatively young (54.8 ± 14.3 years), and predominantly male (63%) with a high prevalence of diabetes mellitus (46%) but low rate of ischaemic heart disease (8%). Sixty one percent were planned for lower arm arteriovenous fistula creation. Malaysian participants (n = 156) were younger (51.8 ± 13.6 years vs 57.1 ± 14.2 years, P < 0.001) with a higher prevalence of diabetes mellitus (65% vs 43%, P < 0.001), but less ischaemic heart disease (5% vs 14%, P < 0.01) compared with the combined Australian, New Zealand and UK cohort (n = 228). Protocol modifications allowing for inclusion of patients receiving aspirin increased the prevalence of co-morbidities compared with the original cohort.\nCONCLUSIONS: The FAVOURED study participants, while mostly similar to patients in contemporary national registry reports and comparable recent clinical trials, were on average younger and had less ischaemic heart disease. These differences were reduced as a consequence of including patients already receiving aspirin.",

        "Published":"2015-07-14",
        "Abstract":"BACKGROUND: Autosomal dominant polycystic kidney disease (ADPKD) is the most common inherited disorder causing kidney disease. Current clinical management of ADPKD focuses primarily on symptom control and reducing associated complications, particularly hypertension. In recent years, improved understanding of molecular and cellular mechanisms involved in kidney cyst growth and disease progression has resulted in new pharmaceutical agents to target disease pathogenesis to prevent progressive disease.\nOBJECTIVES: We aimed to evaluate the effects of interventions for preventing ADPKD progression on kidney function, kidney endpoints, kidney structure, patient-centred endpoints (such as cardiovascular events, sudden death, all-cause mortality, hospitalisations, BP control, quality of life, and kidney pain), as well as the general and specific adverse effects related to their use.\nSEARCH METHODS: We searched the Cochrane Renal Group's Specialised Register to 6 June 2015 using relevant search terms.\nSELECTION CRITERIA: Randomised controlled trials (RCTs) comparing any interventions for preventing the progression of ADPKD with other interventions or placebo were considered for inclusion without language restriction.\nDATA COLLECTION AND ANALYSIS: Two authors independently assessed study risks of bias and extracted data. We summarised treatment effects on clinical outcomes, kidney function and structure and adverse events using random effects meta-analysis. We assessed heterogeneity in estimated treatment effects using the Cochran Q test and I(2) statistic. Summary treatment estimates were calculated as a mean difference (MD) or standardised mean difference (SMD) for continuous outcomes and a risk ratio (RR) for dichotomous outcomes together with their 95% confidence intervals.\nMAIN RESULTS: We included 30 studies (2039 participants) that investigated 11 pharmacological interventions (angiotensin-converting enzyme inhibitors (ACEi), angiotensin receptor blockers (ARBs), calcium channel blockers, beta blockers, vasopressin receptor 2 (V2R) antagonists, mammalian target of rapamycin (mTOR) inhibitors, somatostatin analogues, antiplatelet agents, eicosapentaenoic acids, statins and vitamin D compounds) in this review.ACEi significantly reduced diastolic blood pressure (9 studies, 278 participants: MD -4.96 mm Hg, 95% CI -8.88 to -1.04), but had uncertain effects on kidney volumes (MD -42.50 mL, 95% CI -115.68 to 30.67), GFR (MD -3.41 mL\/min\/1.73 m(2), 95% CI -15.83 to 9.01), and SCr (MD -0.02 mg\/dL, 95% CI -0.14 to 0.09), in data largely restricted to children. ACEi did not show different effects on GFR (MD -8.19 mL\/min\/1.73 m(2), 95% CI -29.46 to 13.07) and albuminuria (SMD -0.19, 95% CI -1.77 to 1.39) when compared with beta-blockers, or SCr (MD 0.00 mg\/dL, 95% CI -0.09 to 0.10) when compared with ARBs.Data for effects of V2R antagonists on kidney function and volumes compared to placebo were limited to narrative information within a single study while these agents increased thirst (1444 participants: RR 2.70, 95% CI 2.24 to 3.24) and dry mouth (1455 participants: RR 1.33, 95% CI 1.01 to 1.76).Compared with no treatment, mTOR inhibitors had uncertain effects on kidney function (2 studies, 115 participants: MD 4.45 mL\/min\/1.73 m(2), 95% CI -3.20 to 12.11) and kidney volume (MD -0.08 L, 95% CI -0.75 to 0.59) but in three studies (560 participants) caused angioedema (RR 13.39, 95% CI 2.56 to 70.00), oral ulceration (RR 6.77, 95% CI 4.42 to 10.38), infections (RR 1.14, 95% CI 1.04 to 1.25) and diarrhoea (RR 1.70, 95% CI 1.26 to 2.29).Somatostatin analogues (6 studies, 138 participants) slightly improved SCr (MD -0.43 mg\/dL, 95% CI -0.86 to -0.01) and total kidney volume (MD -0.62 L, 95% CI -1.22 to -0.01) but had no definite effects on GFR (MD 9.50 mL\/min, 95% CI -4.45 to 23.44) and caused diarrhoea (RR 3.72, 95% CI 1.43 to 9.68).Data for calcium channel blockers, eicosapentaenoic acids, statins, vitamin D compounds and antiplatelet agents were sparse and inconclusive.Random sequence generation was adequate in eight studies, and in almost half of the studies, blinding was not present or not specified. Most studies did not adequately report outcomes, which adversely affected our ability to assess this bias. The overall drop-out rate was over 10% in nine studies, and few were conducted using intention-to-treat analyses.\nAUTHORS' CONCLUSIONS: Although several interventions are available for patients with ADPKD, at present there is little or no evidence that treatment improves patient outcomes in this population and is associated with frequent adverse effects. Additional large randomised studies focused on patient-centred outcomes are needed.",

        "Abstract":"BACKGROUND AND PURPOSE: Patients who survive intracerebral hemorrhage (ICH) often have compelling indications for anticoagulant and antiplatelet medication. This nationwide observational study aimed to determine the extent and predictors of antithrombotic treatment after ICH in Sweden.\nMETHODS: Patients with a first-ever ICH in the Swedish Stroke Register (Riksstroke) 2005 to 2012 who survived hospital discharge were included. Riksstroke data were individually linked with other national registers to determine comorbid conditions and dispensed prescriptions of antithrombotic agents.\nRESULTS: Among the 2777 patients with atrial fibrillation (AF), the proportion with a dispensed prescription of antithrombotic agents was 8.5% (anticoagulants) and 36.6% (antiplatelet agents) within 6 months and 11.1% (anticoagulants) and 43.6% (antiplatelet agents) within 1 year. Among the 11 268 patients without AF, the corresponding figures were 1.6% (anticoagulants) and 13.8% (antiplatelet agents) within 6 months and 2.0% (anticoagulants) and 17.5% (antiplatelet agents) within 1 year. In patients with AF, predictors of anticoagulant treatment were less severe ICH, younger age, previous anticoagulation, valvular disease, and previous ischemic stroke. High CHA2DS2-VASc (congestive heart failure, hypertension, age, diabetes mellitus, stroke [doubled], vascular disease, age, and sex category [female]) scores did not correlate with anticoagulant treatment. There was a positive correlation between high CHA2DS2-VASc and HAS-BLED (hypertension, abnormal renal\/liver function, stroke, bleeding history or predisposition, labile international normalized ratio, elderly, drugs\/alcohol) scores (rs=0.590, P<0.001).\nCONCLUSIONS: In majority of patients who receive antithrombotic agents, treatment is initiated within 6 months of ICH. Still, many patients with compelling indications for antithrombotic treatment are not prescribed antithrombotic agents. Factors other than high risk of embolic stroke by CHA2DS2-VASc in ICH survivors with concurrent AF are used to guide the anticoagulant treatment decision in Swedish clinical practice.",

        "Abstract":"OBJECTIVE: In the Apixaban for Prevention of Acute Ischemic Events (APPRAISE-2) trial, the use of apixaban, when compared with placebo, in high-risk patients with a recent acute coronary syndrome (ACS) resulted in a significant increase in bleeding without a reduction in ischaemic events. The aim of this analysis was to provide further description of these bleeding events and to determine the baseline characteristics associated with bleeding in high-risk post-ACS patients.\nMETHODS: APPRAISE-2 was a multinational clinical trial including 7392 high-risk patients with a recent ACS randomised to apixaban (5 mg twice daily) or placebo. Bleeding including Thrombolysis in Myocardial Infarction (TIMI) major or minor bleeding, International Society on Thrombosis and Haemostasis (ISTH) major or clinically relevant non-major (CRNM) bleeding, and any bleeding were analysed using an on-treatment analysis. Kaplan-Meier curves were plotted to describe the timing of bleeding, and a Cox proportional hazards model was used to identify predictors of ISTH major or CRNM bleeding and any bleeding. Median follow-up was 241 days.\nRESULTS: The proportion of patients who experienced TIMI major or minor, ISTH major or CRNM, and any bleeding was 1.5%, 2.2% and 13.3%, respectively. The incidence of bleeding was highest in the immediate post-ACS period (0.11 in the first 30 days vs 0.03 after 30 days events per 1 patient-year); however, >60% of major bleeding events occurred >30 days after the end of the index hospitalisation. Gastrointestinal bleeding was the most common cause of major bleeding, accounting for 45.9% of TIMI major or minor and 39.5% of ISTH major or CRNM bleeding events. Independent predictors of ISTH major or CRNM bleeding events included older age, renal dysfunction, dual oral antiplatelet therapy, smoking history, increased white cell count and coronary revascularisation.\nCONCLUSIONS: When compared with placebo, the use of apixaban is associated with an important short-term and long-term risk of bleeding in high-risk post-ACS patients, with gastrointestinal bleeding being the most common source of major bleeding. The baseline predictors of major bleeding appear to be consistent with those identified in lower-risk ACS populations with shorter-term follow-up.\nCLINICAL TRIAL NO: NCT00831441.",

        "Abstract":"STUDY OBJECTIVES: To identify demographic and clinical risk factors associated with gastrointestinal (GI) bleeding among a large cohort of patients with atrial fibrillation (AF) who initiated dabigatran therapy for stroke prevention, and to describe patterns of subsequent anticoagulant use after occurrence of the GI bleeding event.\nDESIGN: Retrospective cohort study.\nDATA SOURCES: Large, nationwide United States commercial insurance database.\nPATIENTS: A total of 21,033 patients with nonvalvular AF who initiated dabigatran between October 19, 2010, and December 31, 2012.\nMEASUREMENTS AND MAIN RESULTS: We used multivariate Cox regression analysis to estimate the effect of baseline demographic and clinical characteristics on the probability of a GI bleeding event. Patterns of anticoagulation use after GI bleeding were also examined descriptively. Of the 21,033 patients receiving dabigatran, 446 (2.1%) experienced a GI bleed during follow-up. GI bleeding rates differed across many baseline characteristics. Male sex was associated with a lower risk (adjusted hazard ratio [aHR] 0.78, 95% confidence interval [CI] 0.64-0.95) of GI bleeding. Compared with patients younger than 55 years, those aged 55-64, 65-74, and 75 years or older yielded aHRs of 1.54 (95% CI 0.89-2.68), 2.72 (95% CI 1.59-4.65), and 4.52 (95% CI 2.68-7.64), respectively. Renal impairment (aHR 1.67, 95% CI 1.24-2.25), heart failure (aHR 1.25, 95% CI 1.01-1.56), alcohol abuse (aHR 2.57, 95%CI 1.52-4.35), previous Helicobacter pylori infection (aHR 4.75, 95% CI 1.93-11.68), antiplatelet therapy (aHR 1.49, 95% CI 1.19-1.88), and digoxin use (aHR 1.49, 95% CI 1.19-1.88) were also associated with an increased GI bleeding risk. Of the 446 patients who experienced a GI bleed, 193 (43.3%) restarted an anticoagulant, with most (65.8%) filling prescriptions for dabigatran; the mean time was 50.4 days until restarting any subsequent anticoagulant.\nCONCLUSION: The risk of GI bleeding in patients receiving dabigatran is highly associated with increased age and cardiovascular, renal, and other comorbidities, even after adjusting for other factors. Fewer than 50% of patients restarted an anticoagulant after experiencing a GI bleed. Clinicians should continue to monitor for these risk factors or consider whether alternative therapies may be appropriate.",

        "Abstract":"OBJECTIVE: The present study aimed to compare characteristics related to selection of a P2Y₁₂ antagonist, investigate initiation of therapy with new-generation drugs, and identify predictors of high on-treatment platelet reactivity (HTPR) in patients with acute coronary syndrome treated with stent percutaneous coronary intervention (PCI).\nMETHODS AND RESULTS: Data from 589 patients in the LAPCOR (Laboratory AntiPlatelet efficacy and Clinical Outcome Registry; ClinicalTrials.gov Identifier: NCT02264912) registry was analyzed. P2Y₁₂ receptor antagonist efficacy was measured by VASP phosphorylation 24 ± 4 hours after a loading dose of clopidogrel (600 mg, N=407), prasugrel (60 mg, N=106), or ticagrelor (180 mg, N=76) and expressed by platelet reactivity index (PRI). HTPR was defined as PRI ≥50%. Patients treated with prasugrel were significantly younger and had significantly higher hemoglobin levels than those who received clopidogrel or ticagrelor, while chronic kidney disease was significantly more prevalent in the ticagrelor group. Almost all invasively managed patients given new-generation drugs received a loading dose after coronary angiography. Mean residual PRI and HTPR were significantly higher after clopidogrel (44.2 ± 23.1% and 42.2%, respectively) vs. prasugrel (17.7 ± 18.0% and 9.4%, respectively) or ticagrelor (18.8 ± 17.0% and 7.9%, respectively; all p<0.001). Among multiple variables tested, HTPR in patients treated with the new agents significantly related only to platelet count (p=0.014) and mean platelet volume (p=0.03).\nCONCLUSION: Safety is the most important aspect under consideration in choosing new agents for an individual patient. Other than platelet count and mean platelet volume, factors known as predictors of higher platelet reactivity, did not influence the efficacy of new-generation P2Y₁₂ receptor antagonists.",

We aimed to investigate the stroke risks in these patients with or without anti-coagulant\/anti-platelet therapy by using our national database.\nMETHOD: By using our national health insurance ESRD claim database, we searched patients with AF, more than 18 years old and without prior history of ischemic stroke. Medication information as well as the events of ischemic stroke, hemorrhagic stroke, and transient ischemic accident during follow-up were identified from the database. Propensity score method was used to match all the potential confounders between patients with and without anti-platelets\/warfarin treatment.\nRESULT: A total of 134,410 ESRD patients were identified in the database. Among them, patients with non-valvular AF, over 18 years old, without prior history of ischemic stroke and received monotherapy with anti-platelets (1622) or warfarin (294) served as case groups while patients (2983) without taking any anti-platelets and warfarin served as control groups. The incidences of ischemic stroke or transient ischemic attack (TIA) were not different among the control (6.6%), anti-platelet (6.2%) and warfarin (5.1%) groups in a follow-up period of approximately 4 years. The results remained unchanged after propensity match. Cox-regression analyses also showed no beneficial effect of anti-platelet or warfarin therapy in overall and any subgroups.\nCONCLUSION: In this nationwide cohort analyses, we found that anti-platelet or warfarin treatment could not lower the risk of ischemic stroke in patients with ESRD.",

We describe clinical findings and management of thrombosis of abdominal aorta with peripheral embolism in a patient with congenital afibrinogenemia. A review of arterial thrombosis in inherited hypo-afibrinogenemia was also performed. The patient with a severe bleeding history requiring prophylaxis with fibrinogen concentrates (FC) was admitted for ischaemia of the 4th right toe. An angio-CT of abdominal aorta showed a thrombosis from the origin of renal arteries to the carrefour with a distal floating part. No thrombotic risk factors were found; a previous traumatic lesion of aortic wall might have triggered the thrombus formation, whereas the role of FC prophylaxis remains uncertain. The patient was successfully treated with FC, enoxaparin followed by fondaparinux, and low-dose aspirin without bleeding or thrombosis recurrence. After 2 years, aortic thrombus was almost completely recovered. Sixteen hypo\/afibrinogenemia patients with arterial thrombosis were found in Literature, showing that thrombosis often occurs at a young age, involves large vessels, its recurrence is not unusual, and therapeutic strategy is not defined yet. Our therapeutic approach was effective and also safe, but further studies are needed to improve the knowledge of pathogenesis and the anti-thrombotic management in this peculiar setting.",

        "Abstract":"PURPOSE: Primary resection is typically performed for children with localised suspected Wilms tumours. Resource limitation may necessitate performing these operations nights and weekends. We hypothesise that outcomes will be worse in patients having nephrectomies out-of-hours (OOH) compared to those in-hours (IH).\nMETHODS: With IRB ethics approval, primary renal tumour resections performed on oncology patients from 1989-2011 were reviewed retrospectively. IH operations were defined as Monday-Friday 0745-1530 hours. Outcomes included major intraoperative complications, capsule rupture, and blood loss. Data were analysed using Fischer Exact and Mann-Whitney U tests.\nRESULTS: There were 64 patients with renal tumours who underwent primary resection. Forty-five procedures were performed IH, and 19 OOH. Groups were similar in age, ASA status, tumour size and grade. In a comparison of major intraoperative complications, capsule rupture, and mean blood loss, differences were 2 vs. 26% (p = 0.007), 27 vs. 42% (p = 0.12), 178 vs. 244 ml (p = 0.15) for IH and OOH respectively. There was one perioperative mortality (OOH).\nCONCLUSIONS: Primary renal tumour resections performed OOH were associated with an increase in major complications compared to those performed in standard hours. Avoidance of OOH operating where possible may reduce morbidity for children undergoing primary renal tumour resections.",

Wallace et al. (1977). The patients were divided into 2 groups: 1) 51 patients aged over 60 years; 2) 49 patients aged less than 60 years. In Groups 1 and 2, the mean age at gout onset was 66.1 +\/- 4.8 and 41.6 +\/- 10.0 years, respectively. A comparative retrospective analysis was made to analyze the detection rate for the site of onset gout, the pattern of arthritis, the number of tophus forms, the use of diuretics, small-dose acetylsalicylic acid (ASA), comorbidities, such as hypertension, type 2 diabetes mellitus (T2DM), obesity, chronic renal failure, coronary heart disease, chronic heart failure, and prior myocardial infarction.\nRESULTS: The disease duration in both groups averaged 8 years. In Groups 1 and 2, first metatarsophalangeal joint arthritis was diagnosed at its onset in 77 and 61%, respectively. In these groups, chronic arthritis was also diagnosed in 19 (37%) and 19 (39%). Examinations revealed tophi in 21 and 37% of cases in Groups 1 and 2, respectively. The administration of diuretics was recorded in 25 (49%) and 17 (35%) patients in these groups. Group 1 patients took low-dose ASA more frequently than Group 2 ones (19 (37%) and 7 (14%) patients, respectively; p = 0.013). Hypertension was identified in 23 (45%) examinees in Group 1 and 17 (40%) ones in Group 2. Both groups were matched for the number of patients with obesity (41 and 43%) and for that of patients with T2DM (15 and 10%, respectively). There were significant differences between the compared groups in the incidence of coronary heart disease, myocardial infarction, and chronic heart disease.\nCONCLUSION: The patients' age of gout onset does not affect substantial differences in the clinical features of gout with its comparable duration in the young and elderly patients. The main clinical features of gout are unique to both young and elderly patients. Cardiovascular diseases are more common at gout onset in the elderly.",

        "Abstract":"BACKGROUND: The aim of this study was to describe the incidence and contributory risk factors for thromboembolic complications in children with nephrotic syndrome (NS) and thrombosis.\nMETHODS: Among 188 children with the diagnosis of NS (80 girls; mean age: 12.6 ± 5.4 years) followed up in our hospital for the last 5 years, 17 (9.0 %) children (16 boys) identified as having thromboembolic complications. All 17 children with NS and thrombosis were screened for laboratory risk factors for thrombosis. The diagnosis was confirmed by cranial magnetic resonance imaging, doppler ultrasonography, and echocardiography.\nRESULTS: Among 17 children with thrombosis, 14 (82.3 %) were found to have focal segmental glomerulosclerosis (FSGS) as underlying pathology by renal biopsy. The mean age of the thrombotic children was 4.5 ± 3.2 years at the diagnosis of NS and that was 7.1 ± 4.9 years at the time of thrombosis. The mean time from NS diagnosis to the first thrombosis development was 2.6 ± 2.3 years. Thrombosis occurred during the first year of NS in 9\/17 (52.9 %) children. Most of the children (88.2 %) had venous thrombosis. Among the screened risk factors, high factor VIII level (64.7 %) was the leading factor followed by decreased antithrombin III level (29.4 %). Furthermore, 4 children had central venous catheters and 2 had infection as clinical risk factors for thrombosis.\nCONCLUSION: In this case series, subtype of FSGS, active disease state of NS, central venous catheters, and some inherited and acquired thrombotic risk factors have been identified as contributory factors for the development of thrombosis in children with NS.",

Renal complications of this syndrome are very rare. We encountered an adolescent with Cogan syndrome complicated by aortitis and anti-neutrophil cytoplasmic antibody (ANCA)-associated glomerulonephritis. At the age of 14, the patient showed proteinuria in a screening urinalysis at school and was found to lack a right radial pulse. Magnetic resonance angiography disclosed right subclavian artery stenosis. Examination of a renal biopsy specimen showed ANCA-positive crescentic glomerulonephritis. Steroid and immunosuppressant treatment improved renal function and histopathology, but repeated recurrences followed. At 18, the patient developed rotatory vertigo, a sense of ear fullness, and sensorineural hearing loss. The patient was diagnosed with Cogan syndrome. We know of no previous description of ANCA-positive crescentic glomerulonephritis in children with Cogan syndrome. Accordingly, evaluation of aortitis in childhood should include not only otolaryngologic and ophthalmologic examinations, but also periodic urine examination and renal function tests.",

        "Abstract":"OBJECTIVES: We report the efficacy and safety of levofloxacin versus rifampicin in tuberculous meningitis (TBM).\nPATIENTS AND METHODS: In this open-label, randomized controlled trial from India, patients with TBM diagnosed on the basis of clinical, MRI and CSF findings were included. Patients with hepatic or renal dysfunction, organ transplantation, malignancy, pregnancy, lactation, allergy, seizure, age <15 years and antitubercular treatment ≥1 month were excluded. Sixty patients each were randomized to levofloxacin (10 mg\/kg, maximum 500 mg) or rifampicin (10 mg\/kg, maximum 450 mg). They also received isoniazid, pyrazinamide, ethambutol, prednisolone and aspirin. The primary outcome was death and secondary outcome measures were 6 month disability, repeat MRI changes and serious adverse events (SAEs).\nRESULTS: The median age of the patients was 34.5 (16-75) years. The baseline clinical and MRI findings were similar between the two groups. At 6 months, 13 out of 60 (21.7%) patients in the levofloxacin arm and 23 out of 60 (38.3%) patients in the rifampicin arm had died (P = 0.07). On Cox regression analysis, survival in the levofloxacin group was significantly better than in the rifampicin group (hazard ratio 2.13, 95% CI 1.04-4.34, P = 0.04). The functional outcome (P = 0.47) was, however, not significantly different between the two groups. On intention-to-treat analysis, 10 out of 47 (21.3%) in the levofloxacin arm and 5 out of 37 (13.5%) in the rifampicin arm had poor recovery. Repeat MRI findings did not differ between the groups. Levofloxacin was discontinued more frequently than rifampicin due to SAEs (16 versus 4, P = 0.01).\nCONCLUSIONS: Levofloxacin is superior to rifampicin in reducing 6 month death in TBM but not disability. Levofloxacin may be used in TBM especially in those patients with hepatotoxicity and without seizure.",

        "Abstract":"OBJECTIVE: To investigate the role of Xuebijing injection in inhibiting perioperative inflammatory responses and protecting the function of multiple organs.\nMETHODS: A single-blind, randomized, parallel controlled trial was conducted. 60 patients in the First Affiliated Hospital of Zhejiang University School of Medicine, aged 18 to 80 years, ASA gradeI-III, undergoing elective abdominal surgery, were enrolled. The patients were randomly divided into the control group (n=30) and the treatment group (n=30). In the control group, after induction of anesthesia, a continuous infusion of 0.9% normal saline (NS) 200 mL was given in a speed of 2 mL\/min, while a continuous infusion of Xuebijing 2 mL\/kg in 100 mL of 0.9% NS was given at 2 mL\/min in the treatment group after induction of anesthesia. The blood sample was drawn, and body temperature, routine blood test, C-reactive protein (CRP), liver and kidney function, fasting glucose (Glu), and serum interleukin-6 (IL-6), high mobility group protein B1 (HMGB1) levels were determined in all the patients before anesthesia (T1), at the end of operation (T2), 12 hours after operation (T3), or at 5:00 am on the third day after operation (T4). At the same time the adverse reactions were recorded for evaluation of the safety of Xuebijing.\nRESULTS: After using Xuebijing injection, T3 body temperature and the T3-T1 temperature difference in treatment group were significantly lower than those of the control group (36.70±0.37 centigrade vs. 37.38±0.47 centigrade, t=6.199, P=0.000; 0.07±0.50 vs. 0.85±0.58, t=5.598, P=0.000). Postoperative white blood cell count, neutrophil percentage, and CRP were significantly higher than those before the operation, but the differences between two groups were not statistically significant. Compared with the control group, alanine aminotransferase (ALT), aspartate transaminase (AST), total bilirubin (TBil) levels at T3 of treatment group were significantly reduced (ALT: 17.56±9.80 U\/L vs. 88.60±179.76 U\/L, AST: 27.53±13.12 U\/L vs. 84.16±151.14 U\/L, TBil: 15.46±9.79 μmol\/L vs. 25.63±25.33 μmol\/L, all P<0.05). Difference of conjugated bilirubin (CB), blood urea nitrogen (BUN), creatinine (Cr), Glu was not statistically significant between two groups. IL-6 showed an increasing trend after the operation in both groups, and IL-6 level at T2 of the treatment group was significantly lower than that of the control group (41.42±59.74 ng\/L vs. 124.84±119.66 ng\/L, t=3.405, P=0.001). The HMGB1 level of two groups at T4 were lower than those at T1, but it decreased significantly only in treatment group (22.03±15.73 μg\/L vs. 45.09±33.79 μg\/L, P<0.05), and there was no significant difference between two groups. No serious adverse events occurred during the clinical trial.\nCONCLUSIONS: Application of Xuebijing injection during anesthesia can significantly diminish postoperative inflammatory injury, which plays an important role in the protection of liver function, helps restore organ function and improve prognosis, and it is safe and effective.",

        "Abstract":"BACKGROUND: The American Society of Anesthesiologists Physical Status (ASA-PS) classification is a ranking system that quantifies patient health before anesthesia and surgery. Some surgical disciplines apply the ASA-PS to gauge a patient's likelihood of developing postoperative complications.\nOBJECTIVE: In this study, the authors analyze whether ASA-PS scores can successfully predict risk for postoperative complications in plastic and reconstructive operations.\nMETHODS: The authors retrospectively reviewed the charts of 1801 patient procedures and selected for inclusion 1794 complex plastic and reconstructive operations that took place at 1 of several academic medical institutions between January 2008 and January 2012. ASA-PS scores, patient comorbidities, and postoperative complications were analyzed. Percentile data were treated with tests for proportions. Nonpercentile data were analyzed through comparison of means (t test). Low-risk (ASA 1-2) and high-risk (ASA 3+) groups were compared with simple odds ratios.\nRESULTS: For the 1430 women and 364 men in the patient cohort (average age, 49.5 years), the overall complication rate was 27.7%. When patients with complications were compared to those without, body mass index, operation time, recent major surgery, diabetes, hypertension, renal disease, cancer, and oral contraceptive use were statistically significant. After high-risk (n = 398) and low-risk (n = 1396) groups were identified, infection, delayed wound healing, deep vein thrombosis, and overall complications had significantly increased incidence in the high risk group. Notably, deep vein thrombosis displayed the highest odds ratio (4.17) and a complication rate increase from 0.93% to 3.77%.\nCONCLUSIONS: ASA-PS scores can be used either as substitutes for or as adjuncts to questionnaire-based risk assessment methods in plastic surgery. In addition to deducing significant findings for deep vein thrombosis incidence, ASA-PS scores hold important predictive associations for multiple non-venous thromboembolism complications, providing a broader measurement for postoperative complication risks.\nLEVEL OF EVIDENCE: 4.",

        "Abstract":"PURPOSE: We hypothesized that, after axillary block, positioning the patient in a lateral position with the injected side down and simultaneously in a 20° Trendelenburg position will increase the success rate and quality of the block.\nMETHODS: Fifty patients with chronic renal failure (ASA 2-3) scheduled for arteriovenous fistula surgery were included in this study. In all patients, 30-40 ml of 0.25 % levobupivacaine were injected into the axillary sheath. The block was performed as three injections (multiple injection technique) with the arm in 90° abduction and 90° flexion in the supine position. Patients were randomly allocated to two groups. Group I (n = 25) patients were kept in the supine position after the block. Group II (n = 25) patients were positioned laterally after the block with the injected arm down and in a 20° Trendelenburg position. Sensory and motor block were evaluated at 2, 4, 6, 8, 10, 15, 20, and 25 min after the administration of the block. Thus, the patients in group II were evaluated in a lateral position during the first 30 min. Throughout the surgery and the recovery period, sensory and motor block were evaluated at 30-min intervals.\nRESULTS: There were no significant intergroup differences in the effects on radial, ulnar, median, and musculoskeletal nerve blockade. Thirty minutes after the injection, the patients in group II had higher levels of sensory axillary nerve blockade. Subscapular and thoracodorsal nerve motor block were not detected in group I, while 84 % of the patients in group II experienced blockade of both of these nerves (p < 0.01).\nCONCLUSION: We conclude that, for patients undergoing an axillary block, positioning the patient laterally with the injected side down and in a 20° Trendelenburg position increases the success rate and quality of the block.",

        "Abstract":"BACKGROUND: The etiology and laboratory characteristics of large symptomatic pericardial effusion (LSPE) in the Western world have evolved over the years, and vary between regions, community and tertiary hospitals.\nMETHODS: We reviewed data of 86 consecutive patients who underwent pericardiocentesis or pericardial window due to LSPE in a community hospital from 2001 to 2010. The characteristics of the PE including chemistry, hematology, bacteriology, serology and cytology have been analyzed. We correlated the etiologies of PE with age, gender and clinical presentation.\nRESULTS: The most frequent etiology of LSPE was idiopathic [36% (77% with a clinical diagnosis of pericarditis)], followed by malignancy (31.4%), ischemic heart disease (16.3%), renal failure (4.6%), trauma (4.6%) and autoimmune disease (4.6%). The average age of all the etiological groups excluding trauma was over 50 years. Laboratory tests did not modify the pre-procedure diagnosis in any of the patients. The most frequent presenting symptom was dyspnea (76.6%). Chest pain was mostly common in patients with idiopathic etiology (58.06%). The most frequent medical condition associated with LSPE was the use of anticoagulant or antiplatelet drugs (31.40%), especially aspirin, and in those, the PE tended to be bloody (73%, P = 0.11). Most of the effusions were exudates (70.9%). PE due to renal failure was the largest (1467 ± 1387 ml).\nCONCLUSION: The spectrum of etiologies of LSPE in a community hospital in the Western world in the contemporary era is continuously evolving. The most frequent etiology is now idiopathic, followed by malignancy. Routine laboratory testing still rarely modifies the pre-procedure diagnosis.",

Four groups were created according to the number of partial nephrectomy (PN) performed: very high (VH, ≥ 19 PN), high (H, 10-18 PN), moderate (M, 4-9 PN) and low (L, <4 PN) PN activity. Indications and surgical outcomes were compared among all groups. The effect of hospital volume on postoperative complications and positive margin rate was examined by a multivariable analysis.\nRESULTS: Fifty-three centers included a total of 570 PN. There were 9 VH, 13 H, 12 M and 19 L volume centers which performed 270 (47.4 %), 179 (31.4 %), 74 (13 %) and 47 (8.2 %) PN, respectively. Patients in higher volume centers were significantly younger (p = 0.008), had a lower BMI (p = 0.002) and decreased ASA score (p < 0.001). PN was more frequently performed in higher volume centers (p = 0.006) particularly in case of renal masses <4 cm (p = 0.005). Open surgery was the most common approach in all groups, but laparoscopic PN was more frequent in M volume hospitals (p < 0.001). Positive margin (p = 0.06) and complications (p = 0.022) rates were higher in M group. In multivariable analysis, renal chronic disease was an independent predictor of positive margin rate (p < 0.001, OR 3.91).\nCONCLUSIONS: PN is more frequently performed in high volume institutions particularly for small renal masses. We observed increase positive margin and complication rates in moderate volume centers that might be explained by an increased use of laparoscopy.",

In particular, the mortality rate for intracerebral hemorrhage (ICH) patients with hemodialysis (HD) due to advanced stage CRF is high, and the annual number of such cases is increasing. Therefore, we retrospectively investigated 5 years of clinical data from patients with ICH in our institution to reveal differences in the clinical courses of HD and non-HD patients and to identify risk factors for poor outcomes in ICH patients with HD.\nMETHODS: Three hundred sixty-six consecutive patients with nontraumatic spontaneous ICH, 91% of whom did not receive HD (non-HD group) and 9% of whom received HD for the treatment of CRF (HD group), were enrolled. Clinical data, including the presence of intraventricular hemorrhage (IVH), microbleeds, modified Rankin scale scores, previous medical disease history, the presence of HD, and the days on which ICH occurred, were evaluated.\nRESULTS: In a comparison of HD patients and non-HD patients, the HD patients had higher rates of hematomas in the basal ganglia, IVH, use of antihypertensive drugs, antidiabetic drugs, and antiplatelet\/anticoagulants. The mortality rate was higher in the HD group (44%) than in the non-HD group (21%). In the HD group, the risk factors associated with mortality were hematoma volume, the presence of IVH, and lack of antihypertensive drug use. Eighty-five percent of the ICH occurred on intermittent HD days or before the HD procedure on an HD day.\nCONCLUSIONS: Mortality in ICH patients with HD was associated with lack of antihypertensive drug use. Therefore, strict control of blood pressure is needed in HD patients to prevent ICH, especially on intermittent HD days or before the HD procedure.",

        "Abstract":"BACKGROUND AND AIM: Retrospective evaluation of stroke risk in all patients with atrial fibrillation (AF) admitted to cardiology, internal medicine, and neurology wards in a single Polish district hospital in 2006 and 2010 using two risk stratification schemes, CHADS₂ vs. CHA₂DS₂VASc risk scores and identification of independent predictors of guideline-compliant oral anticoagulant (OAC) treatment.\nMETHODS: We analysed case records of 613 patients with AF (including 300 patients in 2006 and 313 patients in 2010) treated in a district hospital - the John Paul II Western Hospital (Szpital Zachodni) in Grodzisk Mazowiecki, to evaluate their stroke risk and therapy prescribed at discharge.\nRESULTS: The mean patient age in the overall study population (49% of men) was 74.3 years (74.8, 77.5, and 71.9 years, respectively, in patients with paroxysmal, permanent and persistent AF). Patients > 75 years old comprised 58.6% of the study group, and those < 65 years old comprised 16.6% of the study group. The most common concomitant diseases were hypertension (65.9%), chronic heart failure (61.7%), coronary artery disease (43.1%), at least moderate mitral and\/or tricuspid regurgitation (36.4%), and peripheral arterial disease (36%). Indications for OAC treatment were present in 85% (using the CHADS₂ score) or 95% (using the CHA₂DS₂VASc score) patients but this therapy was prescribed at discharge in only 39% of the study group (240 patients). Compared to patients who were not prescribed OAC, those prescribed OAC treatment were younger, more often male, with permanent AF, valvular heart disease, and hypertension. In patients without OAC treatment at discharge, the following conditions were found more frequently than in patients prescribed OAC treatment: paroxysmal AF(49.8% vs. 33.3% in OAC patients), established coronary artery disease (46.1% vs. 38.3%), previous myocardial infarction (27%vs. 18.7%), prior coronary revascularisation (11.2% vs. 6.6%), alcohol abuse (4.2% vs. 0.8%), renal failure (31.6% vs. 21.6%), and stroke or transient ischaemic attack (TIA; 19.3% vs. 12%). In multivariate logistic regression analysis, we identified 5 independent predictive factors associated with prescribing OAC at discharge, including persistent AF vs. paroxysmal AF (odd sratio [OR] = 5.27), permanent AF vs. paroxysmal AF (OR = 1.86), hypertension (OR = 1.50), previous stroke and\/or TIA (OR = 0.59), and age > 75 years vs. < 65 years (OR = 0.53).\nCONCLUSIONS: Despite a high stroke risk as determined by both scores, only 39% of patients received OAC. In the studied population, independent predictors for prescribing OAC at discharge included arterial hypertension (in accordance with the guidelines) and younger patient age, no history of stroke\/TIA, and AF other than paroxysmal. The practice of OAC and\/or antiplatelet therapy use in AF patients discharged from a Polish district hospital was not compliant with the current ESC guidelines either in 2006 or in 2010.",

        "Abstract":"A 31-year-old athlete was admitted to our hospital for previous inferior myocardial infarction (MI), diagnosed by transthoracic echocardiography, myocardial scintigraphy, and cardiac magnetic resonance, while coronary angiography revealed normal coronary arteries. Laboratory investigations excluded acquired or inherited thrombophilia, immunologic disorders, cardiotropic agents infection, and drug abuse. Antiplatelet therapy was started but, after 15 days, he was rehospitalized with diagnosis of multiple left renal infarctions. A transesophageal echocardiography (TEE) was so performed which excluded a right-to-left shunt, suggestive of patent foramen ovale, or other cardioembolic sources in heart chambers and valve apparatus. Antiplatelet therapy was replaced with oral anticoagulants without any further embolic event at one-year follow-up. This case raises two important questions regarding young patients with cryptogenic MI. First, if TEE should be part of a complete diagnostic pathway; second, if oral anticoagulants should be preferred over antiplatelets for secondary prevention particularly when the cause of MI remains unknown.",

        "Abstract":"BACKGROUND: People with end-stage kidney disease treated with dialysis experience high rates of premature death that are at least 30-fold that of the general population, and have markedly impaired quality of life. Despite this, interventions that lower risk factors for mortality (including antiplatelet agents, epoetins, lipid lowering, vitamin D compounds, or dialysis dose) have not been shown to improve clinical outcomes for this population. Although mortality outcomes may be improving overall, additional modifiable determinants of health in people treated with dialysis need to be identified and evaluated. Oral disease is highly prevalent in the general population and represents a potential and preventable cause of poor health in dialysis patients. Oral disease may be increased in patients treated with dialysis due to their lower uptake of public dental services, as well as increased malnutrition and inflammation, although available exploratory data are limited by small sample sizes and few studies evaluating links between oral health and clinical outcomes for this group, including mortality and cardiovascular disease. Recent data suggest periodontitis may be associated with mortality in dialysis patients and well-designed, larger studies are now required.\nMETHODS\/DESIGN: The ORAL Diseases in hemodialysis (ORAL-D) study is a multinational, prospective (minimum follow-up 12 months) study. Participants comprise consecutive adults treated with long-term in-center hemodialysis. Between July 2010 and February 2012, we recruited 4500 dialysis patients from randomly selected outpatient dialysis clinics in Europe within a collaborative network of dialysis clinics administered by a dialysis provider, Diaverum, in Europe (France, Hungary, Italy, Poland, Portugal, and Spain) and South America (Argentina). At baseline, dental surgeons with training in periodontology systematically assessed the prevalence and characteristics of oral disease (dental, periodontal, mucosal, and salivary) in all participants. Oral hygiene habits and thirst were evaluated using self-administered questionnaires. Data for hospitalizations and mortality (total and cause-specific) according to baseline oral health status will be collected once a year until 2022.\nDISCUSSION: This large study will estimate the prevalence, characteristics and correlations of oral disease and clinical outcomes (mortality and hospitalization) in adults treated with dialysis. We will further evaluate any association between periodontitis and risk of premature death in dialysis patients that has been suggested by existing research. The results from this study should provide powerful new data to guide strategies for future interventional studies for preventative and curative oral disease strategies in adults who have end-stage kidney disease.",

        "Abstract":"Nonsteroidal anti-inflammatory drugs (NSAIDs) and aspirin, which are available as \"over-the counter\" medications in most countries, are widely used by both pregnant and lactating women. They are popular non-opioid analgesics for the treatment of pain after vaginal and operative delivery. In addition, NSAIDs are used for tocolysis in premature labor, and low-dose aspirin has a role in the prevention of preeclampsia and recurrent miscarriage in antiphospholipid syndrome. NSAIDs and aspirin may affect fertility and increase the risk of early pregnancy loss. In the second trimester their use is considered reasonably safe, but has been associated with fetal cryptorchism. In the third trimester, NSAIDs and aspirin are usually avoided because of significant fetal risks such as renal injury, oligohydramnios, constriction of the ductus arteriosus (with potential for persistent pulmonary hypertension in the newborn), necrotizing enterocolitis, and intracranial hemorrhage. Maternal administration or ingestion of most NSAIDs results in low infant exposure via breastmilk, such that both cyclooxygenase-1 and cyclooxygenase-2 inhibitors are generally considered safe, and preferable to aspirin, when breastfeeding.",

        "Abstract":"BACKGROUND: A wide variety of treatments, including tonsillectomy and steroid pulse therapy (TSP), are performed for the various stages of IgA nephropathy (IgAN) in Japan. However, the current status of treatments for IgAN patients in Japan is still unclear. The objective of the present study was to investigate the current status of treatments for IgAN patients.\nMETHODS: A nationwide survey was conducted in 2008 by sending questionnaires to the 1,194 teaching hospitals of the Japanese Society of Nephrology (JSN) via Progressive Renal Diseases Research, Research on intractable disease, from the Ministry of Health, Labour and Welfare of Japan.\nRESULTS: Among the total 376 hospitals (31.4 %) that responded, 188 hospitals (66.2 % in the internal medicine departments) performed TSP, out of which 137 hospitals (61.4 %) had begun to perform TSP in the period from 2004 to 2008. The following two major steroid pulse protocols in TSP were used: (1) three cycles over 3 consecutive weeks and (2) three cycles every 2 months. Approximately 68 % of pediatric hospitals (68 hospitals) performed combination therapy with prednisolone, azathioprine, heparin-warfarin and dipyridamole. The clinical remission rates for hematuria and proteinuria after TSP tended to be higher than those following other corticosteroid therapies. Almost all hospitals prescribed antiplatelet agents and renin angiotensin system inhibitor (RAS-I).\nCONCLUSION: In addition to popular treatments such as antiplatelet agents and RAS-I, TSP is becoming a standard treatment for adult IgAN patients in Japan.",

        "Abstract":"BACKGROUND: Antiplatelet agents are widely used to prevent cardiovascular events. The risks and benefits of antiplatelet treatment may be different in people with chronic kidney disease (CKD) for whom occlusive atherosclerotic events are less prevalent, and bleeding hazards might be increased.\nOBJECTIVES: To summarise the effects of antiplatelet treatment (antiplatelet agent versus control or other antiplatelet agent) for the prevention of cardiovascular and adverse kidney outcomes in individuals with CKD.\nSEARCH METHODS: In January 2011 we searched the Cochrane Central Register of Controlled Trials (CENTRAL), MEDLINE, EMBASE and the Cochrane Renal Group's Specialised Register without language restriction.\nSELECTION CRITERIA: We selected randomised controlled trials of any antiplatelet treatment versus placebo or no treatment, or direct head-to-head antiplatelet agent studies in people with CKD. Studies were included if they enrolled participants with CKD, or included people in broader at-risk populations in which data for subgroups with CKD could be disaggregated.\nDATA COLLECTION AND ANALYSIS: Two authors independently extracted data from primary study reports and any available supplementary information for study population, interventions, outcomes, and risks of bias. Risk ratios (RR) and 95% confidence intervals (CI) were calculated from numbers of events and numbers of participants at risk which were extracted from each included study. The reported RRs were extracted where crude event rates were not provided. Data was pooled using the random-effects model.\nMAIN RESULTS: We included 50 studies, enrolling 27,139 participants; 44 studies (21,460 participants) compared an antiplatelet agent with placebo or no treatment, and six studies (5679 participants) directly compared one antiplatelet agent with another. Compared to placebo or no treatment, antiplatelet agents reduced the risk of myocardial infarction (17 studies; RR 0.87, 95% CI 0.76 to 0.99), but not all-cause mortality (30 studies; RR 0.93, 95% CI 0.81 to 1.06), cardiovascular mortality (19 studies; RR 0.89, 95% CI 0.70 to 1.12) or stroke (11 studies; RR 1.00, 95% CI 0.58 to 1.72). Antiplatelet agents increased the risk of major (27 studies; RR 1.33, 95% CI 1.10 to 1.65) and minor bleeding (18 studies; RR 1.49, 95% CI 1.12 to 1.97). In terms of dialysis access outcomes, antiplatelet agents reduced access thrombosis or patency failure but had no effect on suitability for dialysis. Meta-regression analysis indicated no differences in the relative benefit or harms of treatment (risk of all-cause mortality, myocardial infarction, or major bleeding) by type of antiplatelet agent or stage of CKD. Limited data were available for direct head-to-head comparisons of antiplatelet drugs, treatment in kidney transplant recipients, primary prevention, or risk of ESKD.\nAUTHORS' CONCLUSIONS: Antiplatelet agents reduce myocardial infarction but increase major bleeding. Risks may outweigh harms among people with low annual risks of cardiovascular events, including those with early stages of CKD who do not have clinically-evident occlusive cardiovascular disease.",

Demographic data, perioperative and pathological outcomes were compared using Student's test and χ2 for continuous and categorical variables, respectively.\nRESULTS: Both groups were comparable for age, BMI, American Society of Anesthesiologists classification (ASA) and preoperative renal function (MDRD clearance). Tumor complexity was increased in the RAPN group (55.5 % vs. 29.5 % RENAL score≥2, P=0.05). There was no significant difference in terms of operative time (191 vs. 202 min, P=0.2), tumor size (35 vs. 30mm, P=0.1) or positive margins (2 vs. 5, P=0.14). However, there was a significant decrease in warm ischemia time (18 vs. 25.6 min, P=0.004) and hospital stay (5.1 vs. 6.9 days, P=0.003) for RAPN. Estimated blood loss was greater in the RAPN group (490 vs. 280mL, P=0.003), but the numbers of transfusions were similar (5 vs. 4 patients, P=0.96). Urinary tract was more frequently entered in the RAPN group (28 vs. 12, P=0.009). The complication rate was similar in both groups (28 % vs. 32 %, P=0.66).\nCONCLUSION: RAPN is feasible and reproducible.

        "Published":null,
        "Abstract":"BACKGROUND: The evidence base which supported the National Institute for Health and Clinical Excellence (NICE) published Clinical Guideline 3 was limited and 50% was graded as amber. However, the use of tests as part of pre-operative work-up remains a low-cost but high-volume activity within the NHS, with substantial resource implications. The objective of this study was to identify, evaluate and synthesise the published evidence on the clinical effectiveness and cost-effectiveness of the routine use of three tests, full blood counts (FBCs), urea and electrolytes tests (U&Es) and pulmonary function tests, in the pre-operative work-up of otherwise healthy patients undergoing minor or intermediate surgery in the NHS.\nOBJECTIVE: The aims of this study were to estimate the clinical effectiveness and cost-effectiveness of routine pre-operative testing of FBC, electrolytes and renal function and pulmonary function in adult patients classified as American Society of Anaesthesiologists (ASA) grades 1 and 2 undergoing elective minor (grade 1) or intermediate (grade 2) surgical procedures; to compare NICE recommendations with current practice; to evaluate the cost-effectiveness of mandating or withdrawing each of these tests in this patient group; and to identify the expected value of information and whether or not it has value to the NHS in commissioning further primary research into the use of these tests in this group of patients.\nDATA SOURCES: The following electronic bibliographic databases were searched: (1) BIOSIS; (2) Cumulative Index to Nursing and Allied Health Literature; (3) Cochrane Database of Systematic Reviews; (4) Cochrane Central Register of Controlled Trials; (5) EMBASE; (6) MEDLINE; (7) MEDLINE In-Process & Other Non-Indexed Citations; (8) NHS Database of Abstracts of Reviews of Effects; (9) NBS Health Technology Assessment Database; and (10) Science Citation Index. To identify grey and unpublished literature, the Cochrane Register of Controlled Trials, National Research Register Archive, National Institute for Health Research Clinical Research Network Portfolio database and the Copernic Meta-search Engine were searched. A large routine data set which recorded the results of tests was obtained from Leeds Teaching Hospitals Trust.\nREVIEW METHODS: A systematic review of the literature was carried out. The searches were undertaken in March to April 2008 and June 2009. Searches were designed to retrieve studies that evaluated the clinical effectiveness and cost-effectiveness of routine pre-operative testing of FBC, electrolytes and renal function and pulmonary function in the above group of patients. A postal survey of current practice in testing patients in this group pre-operatively was undertaken in 2008. An exemplar cost-effectiveness model was constructed to demonstrate what form this would have taken had there been sufficient data. A large routine data set that recorded the results of tests was obtained from Leeds Teaching Hospitals Trust. This was linked to individual patient data with surgical outcomes, and regression models were estimated.\nRESULTS: A comprehensive and systematic search of both the clinical effectiveness and cost-effectiveness literature identified a large number of potentially relevant studies. However, when these studies were subjected to detailed review and quality assessment, it became clear that the literature provides no evidence on the clinical effectiveness and cost-effectiveness of these specific tests in the specific patient groups. The postal survey had a 17% response rate. Results reported that in ASA grade 1, patients aged < 40 years with no comorbidities undergoing minor surgery did not have routine tests for FBC, electrolytes and renal function and pulmonary function. The results from the regression model showed that the frequency of test use was not consistent with the hypothesis of their routine use. FBC tests were performed in only 58% of patients in the data set and U&E testing was carried out in only 57%.\nLIMITATIONS: Systematic searches of the clinical effectiveness and cost-effectiveness literature found that there is no evidence on the clinical effectiveness or cost-effectiveness of these tests in this specific clinical context for the NHS. A survey of NHS hospitals found that respondent trusts were implementing current NICE guidance in relation to pre-operative testing generally, and a de novo analysis of routine data on test utilisation and post-operative outcome found that the tests were not be used in routine practice; rather, use was related to an expectation of a more complex clinical case. The paucity of published evidence is a limitation of this study. The studies included relied on non-UK health-care systems data, which may not be transferable. The inclusion of non-randomised studies is associated with an increased risk of bias and confounding. Scoping work to establish the likely mechanism of action by which tests would impact upon outcomes and resource utilisation established that the cause of an abnormal test result is likely to be a pivotal determinant of the cost-effectiveness of a pre-operative test and therefore evaluations would need to consider tests in the context of the underlying risk of specific clinical problems (i.e. risk guided rather than routine use).\nCONCLUSIONS: The time of universal utilisation of pre-operative tests for all surgical patients is likely to have passed. The evidence we have identified, though weak, indicates that tests are increasingly utilised in patients in whom there is a reason to consider an underlying raised risk of a clinical abnormality that should be taken into account in their clinical management. It is likely that this strategy has led to substantial resource savings for the NHS, although there is not a published evidence base to establish that this is the case. The total expenditure on pre-operative tests across the NHS remains significant. Evidence on current practice indicates that clinical practice has changed to such a degree that the original research question is no longer relevant to UK practice. Future research on the value of these tests in pre-operative work-up should be couched in terms of the clinical effectiveness and cost-effectiveness in the identification of specific clinical abnormalities in patients with a known underlying risk. We suggest that undertaking a multicentre study making use of linked, routinely collected data sets would identify the extent and nature of pre-operative testing in this group of patients.\nFUNDING: The National Institute for Health Research Health Technology Assessment programme.",

Patients treated with prasugrel had fewer ischemic events but more procedure-related bleeding. In the present study, we aimed to determine the effect of bivalirudin on bleeding in patients treated with prasugrel. A total of 692 patients with consecutive acute coronary syndrome underwent PCI with stent implantation and were anticoagulated with bivalirudin. The patients were divided into 2 groups according to the antiplatelet regimen (clopidogrel or prasugrel) chosen during or just after PCI. The bleeding complications during hospitalization were tabulated. Ischemic events were analyzed during hospitalization and at 30 days. Prasugrel was used in 96 patients (13.9%) and clopidogrel in 596 (86.1%). The clinical and procedural characteristics were similar, although the clopidogrel patients more often reported systemic hypertension (p = 0.01), previous PCI (p <0.001), and chronic renal insufficiency (p = 0.05). During hospitalization, the bleeding and ischemic complication rates were similar and low in both groups (major in-hospital complications 4.2% for clopidogrel vs 2.1% for prasugrel, p = 0.6; Thrombolysis In Myocardial Infarction major bleeding 2.5% vs 2.1%, p = 1.00; Thrombolysis In Myocardial Infarction minor bleeding 4.2% vs 5.2%, p = 0.6). At 30 days, no differences were found in ischemic events between both groups (target vessel revascularization\/major adverse cardiac events 5.4% vs 2.1%, p = 0.2). In conclusion, prasugrel, when given after bivalirudin as the intraprocedural antithrombin agent for patients with acute coronary syndrome undergoing PCI, is as safe and effective as clopidogrel.",

For the early maintenance (10 days to 3 months) and long-term (beyond 3 months) treatment of established VTE, LMWH for a minimum of 3 months is preferred over vitamin K antagonists (VKA) [1A]; idraparinux is not recommended [2C]; after 3-6 months, LMWH or VKA continuation should be based on individual evaluation of the benefit-risk ratio, tolerability, patient preference and cancer activity [Guidance]. For the treatment of VTE recurrence in cancer patients under anticoagulation, three options can be considered: (i) switch from VKA to LMWH when treated with VKA; (ii) increase in LMWH dose when treated with LMWH, and (iii) VCF insertion [Guidance]. For the prophylaxis of postoperative VTE in surgical cancer patients, use of LMWH o.d. or low dose of UFH t.i.d. is recommended; pharmacological prophylaxis should be started 12-2 h preoperatively and continued for at least 7-10 days; there are no data allowing conclusion that one type of LMWH is superior to another [1A]; there is no evidence to support fondaparinux as an alternative to LMWH [2C]; use of the highest prophylactic dose of LMWH is recommended [1A]; extended prophylaxis (4 weeks) after major laparotomy may be indicated in cancer patients with a high risk of VTE and low risk of bleeding [2B]; the use of LMWH for VTE prevention in cancer patients undergoing laparoscopic surgery may be recommended as for laparotomy [Guidance]; mechanical methods are not recommended as monotherapy except when pharmacological methods are contraindicated [2C]. For the prophylaxis of VTE in hospitalized medical patients with cancer and reduced mobility, we recommend prophylaxis with LMWH, UFH or fondaparinux [1B]; for children and adults with acute lymphocytic leukemia treated with l-asparaginase, depending on local policy and patient characteristics, prophylaxis may be considered in some patients [Guidance]; in patients receiving chemotherapy, prophylaxis is not recommended routinely [1B]; primary pharmacological prophylaxis of VTE may be indicated in patients with locally advanced or metastatic pancreatic [1B] or lung [2B] cancer treated with chemotherapy and having a low risk of bleeding; in patients treated with thalidomide or lenalidomide combined with steroids and\/or chemotherapy, VTE prophylaxis is recommended; in this setting, VKA at low or therapeutic doses, LMWH at prophylactic doses and low-dose aspirin have shown similar effects; however, the efficacy of these regimens remains unclear [2C]. Special situations include brain tumors, severe renal failure (CrCl<30 mL min(-1) ), thrombocytopenia and pregnancy. Guidances are provided in these contexts.\nCONCLUSIONS: Dissemination and implementation of good clinical practice for the management of VTE, the second cause of death in cancer patients, is a major public health priority.",

        "Published":null,
        "Abstract":"Warfarin, at a dose adjusted according to the INR, is the standard prophylactic anticoagulant for patients with atrial fibrillation and a major risk of thrombosis. Dabigatran, a thrombin inhibitor, is an alternative when warfarin fails to maintain the INR within the therapeutic range most of the time. Warfarin and aspirin are reasonable choices for patients at moderate risk of thrombosis. Rivaroxaban, a factor Xa inhibitor, has been approved for the treatment of patients with atrial fibrillation and a moderate or major risk of thrombosis, but with no associated valve abnormalities. Clinical evaluation of rivaroxaban is mainly based on a double-blind, randomised, non-inferiority trial comparing rivaroxaban (20 or 15 mg taken once daily, according to renal function) versus adjusted-dose warfarin in 14 264 patients at high risk of thrombosis. Most patients were treated for at least 18 months. Overall mortality was not significantly different between the 2 groups (about 5% annually), nor was the incidence of stroke or systemic embolism (2% annually). Note that the dose of warfarin was not optimised in this trial. Indirect comparison with dabigatran is too fraught with methodological flaws to provide meaningful results. Overall, data on rivaroxaban are less convincing than those on dabigatran. About 35% of patients in the 2 groups stopped treatment prematurely, mainly because of adverse effects or withdrawal of consent. The overall incidence of bleeding was similar with rivaroxaban and warfarin (about 15%), including the incidence of serious bleeding (3.5%). Rivaroxaban was associated with fewer bleeding-related deaths (0.24% versus 0.48%), more cases of serious gastrointestinal bleeding (3.2% versus 2.02%) and fewer cases of intracranial haemorrhage (0.8% versus 1.2%). Combination with cytochrome P450 or P-glycoprotein inhibitors, or with drugs affecting renal function, boosts the effects of rivaroxaban. Combination with other antithrombotic drugs should be avoided. In practice, warfarin remains the standard prophylactic drug for patients with atrial fibrillation and a major risk of thrombosis, while dabigatran is an alternative in cases that are difficult to manage. In mid-2012, the data on rivaroxaban are not sufficiently convincing to challenge this standard.",

        "Abstract":"BACKGROUND: Otamixaban is a synthetic intravenous direct factor Xa inhibitor, with rapid onset\/offset, linear kinetics, and no significant renal elimination. A phase II trial in acute coronary syndromes (ACS) showed a marked reduction in the combined end point of death or myocardial infarction (MI) and similar bleeding rates with otamixaban at midrange doses, compared with unfractionated heparin (UFH) and eptifibatide.\nDESIGN: The TAO trial is a phase III, randomized, double-blind, triple-dummy controlled trial testing the efficacy of otamixaban over UFH plus eptifibatide in patients with non-ST-segment elevation ACS to be treated with dual oral antiplatelet therapy and an invasive strategy. Approximately 13,220 patients in 55 countries will be randomized (1:1:1 ratio) to receive UFH plus downstream eptifibatide (started pre-percutaneous coronary intervention and continued per label) or otamixaban (0.08 mg\/kg intravenous bolus at randomization then 0.100 or 0.140 mg\/kg per hour intravenous infusion). An interim analysis was performed after ≥1,969 patients per arm completed 7 days of follow-up and the Data Monitoring Committee selected 1 otamixaban dose (blinded to investigators) to be carried forward using a prespecified algorithm. The primary efficacy outcome is the composite of all-cause mortality or new MI through day 7. The primary safety outcome is thrombolysis in MI major or minor bleeding through day 7. Secondary outcomes include all-cause mortality, recurrent ischemia\/infarction resulting in prolonged\/recurrent hospitalization, periprocedural angiographic complications, and pharmacokinetic data in 6,000 patients.\nCONCLUSIONS: The TAO trial will assess the clinical efficacy and safety of otamixaban in non-ST-segment elevation ACS with planned invasive strategy.",

        "Abstract":"Diabetes mellitus (DM) is the most important predictor of chronic kidney disease (CKD), and pharmacodynamic (PD) studies have shown that DM patients with impaired renal function are characterized by reduced clopidogrel response. However, post-hoc PD studies conducted in unselected cohorts, composed of both DM and non-DM patients, have reached controversial findings on the effects of CKD on clopidogrel response, likely attributed to patient heterogeneity. The impact of renal function on clopidogrel response in non-DM patients remains unexplored and represented the aim of this prospective investigation. We conducted a prospective PD investigation in non-DM patients with and without CKD defined as an estimated glomerular filtration rate (eGFR) below or above 60 mL\/min, respectively. All patients had known coronary artery disease and were on maintenance aspirin therapy. PD assessments were assessed at baseline and 2 and 24 h after a 600 mg loading dose of clopidogrel. PD assays included light transmission aggregometry (LTA) using 5 and 20 μmol ADP with and without PGE1 and flow cytometric assessment of the phosphorylation status of the vasodilator-stimulated phosphoprotein (VASP) to determine the platelet reactivity index. A total of 60 patients were studied (n = 30 eGFR ≥60 mL\/min; n = 30 eGFR <60 mL\/min). At baseline there were no differences between groups. Following clopidogrel loading dose administration, levels of on-treatment platelet reactivity were similar between groups at 2 and 24 h as measured with LTA and VASP. Accordingly, there were no differences in rates of high on-treatment platelet reactivity between groups. In non-DM patients with CAD, the presence of impaired renal function is not associated with differences in clopidogrel-induced antiplatelet effects compared with patients with preserved renal function.",

        "Abstract":"Kawasaki disease (KD) is an acute systemic vasculitis syndrome occurring mostly in children younger than 5 years of age. Especially young infants (<1 year) have an increased risk of coronary artery lesions (CAL). Whereas the etiology of KD is still unknown, progress in treatment during its acute phase has decreased the incidence of CAL from 25-30% to 3-5%. In \"atypical KD\", the clinical picture is dominated by an unusual symptom as seizure, bloody diarrhea, compressive cervical adenopathy, nephrotic syndrome or hyponatremia. To make a diagnosis in case of \"incomplete KD\", the supplementary criteria (clinical and biological) suggested by the American Heart Association can be helpful. Once the diagnosis established, the treatment of choice is the intravenous administration of immunoglobulin associated to aspirin at anti-inflammatory dose. However, some patients remain feverish within 36 hours following the end of immunoglobulin administration. This treatment resistance seems increasing in some regions of the globe and can touch up 20% of patients. The unsatisfactory answer to the initial treatment is associated to a higher risk of CAL. Predictive criteria of resistance have been identified and allow to strengthen the medical treatment with a second administration of immunoglobulins. Moreover, methylprednisolone pulse therapy and tumor necrosis factor-alpha blockade (infliximab) appear to be interesting therapeutic options in the future. At last, other treatments have not been the object of controlled studies yet but are alternatives in refractory forms e.g. cytotoxic agents (cyclosporine A, cyclophosphamide, methotrexate), plasmapheresis, plasma exchange or abciximab, especially in patients with aneurysms. Sclerotic vascular changes are often observed in post-Kawasaki disease patients, including those without coronary lesions during the acute phase. Indeed, endothelial dysfunction and risk factors for the development of atherosclerosis, such as dyslipidemia, decreased vascular elasticity, increased C-reactive protein, oxidative stress, and inflammatory cytokines, are known to be present in the late phase of KD. However, it is not clearly established that the survivors of KD carry a higher risk of coronary disease. The epidemiological studies of the next decade should give clearer answers as far as these patients henceforth achieved the age of the atherosclerosis. In conclusion, the diagnosis of KD imposes a strict supervision by a pediatric cardiologist initially. The follow-up is organized according to the existence or non-existence of coronary artery lesions. Late complications as stenosis or coronary thrombosis can occur but remain rare. Thus, it is necessary to be reassuring with the parents, especially for those whose children had no or regressive CAL, while recommending a prevention of the cardiovascular risk factors in the adulthood.",

        "Abstract":"This review highlights factors of importance for the clinical care of pregnant women with pregestational diabetes and microalbuminuria or diabetic nephropathy with particular focus on the role of intensive antihypertensive treatment during pregnancy. Most information in the literature comes from women with type 1 diabetes and diabetic nephropathy, but this is probably also valid for women with type 2 diabetes. Careful counseling of women with diabetic nephropathy before pregnancy with estimation of the risk for the mother and fetus is important. Pregnancy does not result in worsening of kidney function in women with diabetic nephropathy and normal serum creatinine, but pregnancy complications such as pre-eclampsia and preterm delivery are common. Intensive metabolic control before and during pregnancy, low-dose aspirin from 12 gestational weeks onward, and intensive antihypertensive treatment are important. Methyldopa, labetalol, and nifedipine are regarded safe in pregnancy, whereas angiotensin converting enzyme inhibitors, AngII antagonists, or statins should be paused before pregnancy. Case series and pathophysiological studies support the use of a stringent goal for BP and albumin excretion in pregnant women with diabetic nephropathy. Screening for diabetic retinopathy before and during pregnancy is mandatory and laser treatment should be performed if indicated. Pregnancy outcome in women with diabetic nephropathy has improved considerably with a take-home-baby rate of approximately 95%. Further research on the benefits and risks of intensive antihypertensive treatment in this population is needed.",

        "Published":null,
        "Abstract":"The underlying disorder in the vast majority of cases of cardiovascular disease (CVD) is atherosclerosis, for which low-density lipoprotein cholesterol (LDL-C) is recognized as the first and foremost risk factor. HMG-CoA reductase inhibitors, popularly called statins, are highly effective and remarkably safe in reducing LDL-C and non-HDL-C levels. Evidence from clinical trials have demonstrated that statin therapy can reduce the risk of myocardial infarction (MI), stroke, death, and the need for coronary artery revascularization procedures (CARPs) by 25-50%, depending on the magnitude of LDL-C lowering achieved. Benefits are seen in men and women, young and old, and in people with and without diabetes or prior diagnosis of CVD. Clinical trials comparing standard statin therapy to intensive statin therapy have clearly demonstrated greater benefits in CVD risk reduction (including halting the progression and even reversing coronary atherosclerosis) without any corresponding increase in risk. Numerous outcome trials of intensive statin therapy using atorvastatin 80 mg\/d have demonstrated the safety and the benefits of lowering LDL-C to very low levels. This led the USNCEP Guideline Committee to standardize 40 mg\/dL as the optimum LDL-C level, above which the CVD risk begins to rise. Recent studies have shown intensive statin therapy can also lower CVD events even in low-risk individuals with LDL-C <110 mg\/dL. Because of the heightened risk of CVD in Asian Indians, the LDL-C target is set at 30 mg\/dL lower than that recommended by NCEP. Accordingly, the LDL-C goal is < 70 mg\/dL for Indians who have CVD, diabetes, metabolic syndrome, or chronic kidney disease. Intensive statin therapy is often required in these populations as well as others who require a > or = 50% reduction in LDL-C. Broader acceptance of this lower LDL-C targets and its implementation could reduce the CVD burden in the Indian population by 50% in the next 25 years. Clinical trial data support an extremely favorable benefit-to-risk ratio of intensive statin therapy with some but not all statins. Atorvastatin 80 mg\/d is 100 times safer than aspirin 81 mg\/d and 10 times safer than diabetic medications. Intensive statin therapy is more effective and safe compared to intensive control of blood sugar or blood pressure in patients with diabetes.",

        "Abstract":"PURPOSE: Patients with coagulopathy are at increased risk of peri-operative hemorrhage. The aim of the present study was to compare ureteroscopy (URS) in these high risk patients to those with normal bleeding profile.\nMATERIALS AND METHODS: Twelve patients with coagulopathies (Group I) undergoing 17 URS were included in the study [3 for biopsy of ureteral lesions and 9 for Holmium Laser Lithotripsy (HLL)]. A patient had Child B (MELD 11) cirrhosis, 6 patients were on warfarin, 3 patients on ASA, 1 patient on ASA and clopidogrel, and the last patient was on heparin. URS in Group I was performed without correction of coagulopathy. Group II consisted of 32 patients with normal bleeding profile who underwent 34 URS concurrently.\nRESULTS: Group I included 4 ureteral biopsies in 3 patients with suspicious ureteral lesions and 13 URS for HLL in 9 patients with nephrolithiasis. There were no significant differences between the two groups in terms of patient age, sex, percent of renal stones, median operative and fluoroscopy times.

        "Published":null,
        "Abstract":"Maximum contaminant levels are used to control potential health hazards posed by chemicals in drinking water, but no primary national or international limits for aluminum (Al) have been adopted. Given the differences in toxicological profiles, the present evaluation derives total allowable concentrations for certain water-soluble inorganic Al compounds (including chloride, hydroxide, oxide, phosphate and sulfate) and for the hydrated Al silicates (including attapulgite, bentonite\/montmorillonite, illite, kaolinite) in drinking water. The chemistry, toxicology and clinical experience with Al materials are extensive and depend upon the particular physical and chemical form. In general, the water solubility of the monomeric Al materials depends on pH and their water solubility and gastrointestinal bioavailability are much greater than that of the hydrated Al silicates. Other than Al-containing antacids and buffered aspirin, food is the primary source of Al exposure for most healthy people. Systemic uptake of Al after ingestion of the monomeric salts is somewhat greater from drinking water (0.28%) than from food (0.1%). Once absorbed, Al accumulates in bone, brain, liver and kidney, with bone as the major site for Al deposition in humans. Oral Al hydroxide is used routinely to bind phosphate salts in the gut to control hyperphosphatemia in people with compromised renal function. Signs of chronic Al toxicity in the musculoskeletal system include a vitamin D-resistant osteomalacia (deranged membranous bone formation characterized by accumulation of the osteoid matrix and reduced mineralization, reduced numbers of osteoblasts and osteoclasts, decreased lamellar and osteoid bands with elevated Al concentrations) presenting as bone pain and proximal myopathy. Aluminum-induced bone disease can progress to stress fractures of the ribs, femur, vertebrae, humerus and metatarsals. Serum Al ≥100 µg\/L has a 75-88% positive predictive value for Al bone disease. Chronic Al toxicity is also manifest in the hematopoietic system as an erythropoietin-resistant microcytic hypochromic anemia. Signs of Al toxicity in the central nervous system (speech difficulty to total mutism to facial grimacing to multifacial seizures and dyspraxia) are related to Al accumulation in the brain and these symptoms can progress to frank encephalopathy. There are four groups of people at elevated risk of systemic Al intoxication after repeated ingestion of monomeric Al salts: the preterm infant, the infant with congenital uremia and children and adults with kidney disease. There is a dose-dependent increase in serum and urinary Al in people with compromised renal function, and restoration of renal function permits normal handling of systemically absorbed Al and resolution of Al bone disease. Clinical experience with 960 mg\/day of Al(OH)(3) (~5 mg Al\/kg-day) given by mouth over 3 months to men and women with compromised renal function found subclinical reductions in hemoglobin, hematocrit and serum ferritin. Following adult males and females with reduced kidney function found that ingestion of Al(OH)(3) at 2.85 g\/day (~40 mg\/kg-day Al) over 7 years increased bone Al, but failed to elicit significant bone toxicity. There was one report of DNA damage in cultured lymphocytes after high AlCl(3) exposure, but there is no evidence that ingestion of common inorganic Al compounds presents an increased carcinogenic risk or increases the risk for adverse reproductive or developmental outcomes. A number of studies of Al exposure in relation to memory in rodents have been published, but the results are inconsistent. At present, there is no evidence to substantiate the hypothesis that the pathogenesis of Alzheimer's Disease is caused by Al found in food and drinking water at the levels consumed by people living in North America and Western Europe. Attapulgite (palygorskite) has been used for decades at oral doses (recommended not to exceed two consecutive days) of 2,100 mg\/day in children of 3-6 years, 4,200 mg\/day in children of 6-12 years, and 9,000 mg\/day in adults. Chronic ingestion of insoluble hydrated Al silicates (in kg) can result in disturbances in iron and potassium status, primarily as a result of clay binding to intestinal contents and enhanced fecal iron and zinc elimination. Sufficiently high doses of ingested Al silicates (≥50 g\/day) over prolonged periods of time can elicit a deficiency anemia that can be corrected with oral Fe supplements. There is essentially no systemic Al uptake after ingestion of the hydrated Al silicates. Rats fed up to 20,000 ppm Ca montmorillonite (equivalent to 1,860 ppm total Al as the hydrated Al silicate) for 28 weeks failed to develop any adverse signs. The results of dietary Phase I and II clinical trials conducted in healthy adult volunteers over 14 days and 90 days with montmorillonite found no adverse effects after feeding up to 40 mg\/kg-day as Al. Since the Al associated with ingestion of hydrated Al silicates is not absorbed into the systemic circulation, the hydrated Al silicates seldom cause medical problems unless the daily doses consumed are substantially greater than those used clinically or as dietary supplements. A no-observable-adverse-effect-level (NOAEL) of 13 mg\/kg-day as total Al can be identified based on histologic osteomalacia seen in adult hemodialysis patients given Al hydroxide for up to 7 years as a phosphate binder. Following U.S. EPA methods for calculation of an oral reference dose (RfD), an intraspecies uncertainty factor of 10x was applied to that value results in a chronic oral reference dose (RfD) of 1.3 mg Al\/kg-day; assuming a 70-kg adult consumes 2 L of drinking water per day and adjusting for a default 20% relative source contribution that value corresponds to a drinking water maximum concentration of 9 mg\/L measured as total Al. A chronic NOAEL for montmorillonite as representative of the hydrated Al silicates was identified from the highest dietary concentration (20,000 ppm) fed in a 28-week bioassay with male and female Sprague-Dawley rats. Since young rats consume standard laboratory chow at ~23 g\/day, this concentration corresponds to 56 mg Al\/kg-day. Application of 3x interspecies uncertainty factor and a 3x factor to account for study duration results in a chronic oral RfD of 6 mg Al\/kg-day. Of note, this RfD is 5-10 fold less than oral doses of Al silicates consumed by people who practice clay geophagy and it corresponds to a maximum drinking water concentration of 40 mg Al\/L. To utilize the values derived here, the risk manager must recognize the particular product (e.g., alum) or source (e.g., groundwater, river water, clay or cement pipe) of the Al found in tap water, apply the appropriate analytical methods (atomic absorption, energy dispersive X-ray diffraction, infrared spectral analysis and\/or scanning transmission electron microscopy) and compare the results to the most relevant standard. The drinking water concentrations derived here are greater than the U.S. EPA secondary maximum contaminant level (MCL) for total Al of 0.05-0.2 mg\/L [40 CFR 143.3]. As such, domestic use of water with these concentrations is likely self-limiting given that its cloudy appearance will be greater than the maximum permitted (0.5-5.0 nephalometric turbidity units; 40 CFR Parts 141 and 142). Therefore, the organoleptic properties of Al materials in water determine public acceptance of potable water as contrast to any potential health hazard at the concentrations ordinarily present in municipal drinking water.",

        "Abstract":"INTRODUCTION: Data regarding management characteristics of non-ST elevation acute coronary syndromes (NSTE ACS) in Mexican, Hispanic and Non- Hispanic white patients are scarce.\nMETHODS: We sought to describe the clinical characteristics, process of care, and outcomes of Mexicans, Hispanics and non-Hispanic whites presenting with NSTE ACS at Mexican and US hospitals. We compared baseline characteristics, resource use, clinical practice guidelines (CPGs) compliance and in-hospital mortality among 3 453 Mexicans, 3 936 Hispanics and 90, 280 non-Hispanic whites with NSTE ACS from the RENASICA and CRUSADE registries.\nRESULTS: Mexicans were younger with a different cardiovascular risk profile, fewer incidences of hypertension (p<0.001), hyperlipidemia (p<0.001), renal failure (p<0.001) and prior revascularization (p<0.001) but were more likely to be smoking compared with Hispanics and non-Hispanic white populations. Mexicans and Hispanics had a higher incidence of diabetes (p<0.001). At clinical presentation Mexican patients were more likely to have ST depression (p<0.001) but less likely to have left ventricular dysfunction (p<0.001) and troponin stratification (p<0.001). Regarding CPGs compliance, aspirin was used in 90% of patients in all groups, but clopidogrel or unfractionated or low-molecular weight heparin in 50% of patients or less. Mexican patients were less likely to receive glycoprotein IIb\/IIIa inhibitors and revascularization. In spite of clinical differences and therapeutic trends, cardiovascular mortality was similar among all groups (Mexicans 4%, Hispanics 4% and non-Hispanic white 5%). In all groups of patients, a poor CPGs compliance was observed.\nCONCLUSIONS: In a post-hoc analysis, Mexican patients with NSTE ACS had a different cardiovascular risk factor profile and clinical presentation, and less intensive in - hospital treatment than Hispanic and non-Hispanic white patients.

        "Abstract":"BACKGROUND: Antiplatelet agents are used to prevent cardiovascular events; however, treatment effects may differ in persons with chronic kidney disease (CKD) because atherosclerotic disease is less prevalent, whereas bleeding hazards may be increased in this population.\nPURPOSE: To summarize the effects of antiplatelet treatment on cardiovascular events, mortality, and bleeding in persons with CKD.\nDATA SOURCES: Embase and Cochrane databases through November 2011 without language restriction.\nSTUDY SELECTION: Randomized trials that included adults with CKD and compared antiplatelet agents with standard care, placebo, or no treatment.\nDATA EXTRACTION: Data for populations, interventions, outcomes, and risk for bias were extracted. Quality of evidence for treatment effects on myocardial infarction, death, and bleeding was summarized by using Grading of Recommendations Assessment, Development, and Evaluation guidelines.\nDATA SYNTHESIS: Nine trials (all post hoc subgroup analyses for CKD) involving 9969 persons who had acute coronary syndromes or were undergoing percutaneous coronary intervention and 31 trials involving 11,701 persons with stable or no cardiovascular disease were identified. Low-quality evidence has found that in persons with acute coronary syndromes, glycoprotein IIb\/IIIa inhibitors or clopidogrel plus standard care compared with standard care alone had little or no effect on all-cause or cardiovascular mortality or on myocardial infarction but increased serious bleeding. Compared with placebo or no treatment in persons with stable or no cardiovascular disease, antiplatelet agents prevented myocardial infarction but had uncertain effects on mortality and increased minor bleeding according to generally low-quality evidence.\nLIMITATIONS: Data for antiplatelet agents in persons with CKD are frequently derived from post hoc analyses of trials of broader populations. Definitions for bleeding outcomes and trial duration were heterogeneous.\nCONCLUSION: Benefits for antiplatelet therapy among persons with CKD are uncertain and are potentially outweighed by bleeding hazards.\nPRIMARY FUNDING SOURCE: None.",

        "Abstract":"BACKGROUND: Blunt abdominal aortic injury (BAAI) is a rare injury with less than 200 cases in the current reported world literature, mostly in case report format. We sought to describe the experience of a high-volume trauma center and to provide a contemporary review of the literature to better understand the natural history and management of this injury.\nMETHODS: This was a retrospective review of patients with BAAI between 1996 and 2010. Data collected included demographics, mechanism of injury, associated injuries, type of intervention, subsequent imaging, and follow-up. BAAI was classified by the presence of external aortic contour abnormality noted as an intimal tear, large intimal flap, pseudoaneurysm, or free rupture. Abdominal aorta zones of injury were classified by possible surgical approaches as zone I (diaphragmatic hiatus to superior mesenteric artery [SMA]), zone II (includes SMA and renal arteries), and zone III (from the inferior aspect of the renal arteries to the aortic bifurcation).\nRESULTS: We identified 28 individuals (68% male) with BAAI (median age, 28.5; range, 6-61 years). The median injury severity score was 45 (range, 16-75), and 39% were hypotensive at presentation. BAAI presented as intimal tear (21%), large intimal flap (39%), pseudoaneurysm (11%), and free rupture (29%). Zone III was the most common location of injury. Management depended on the location and type of injury: nonoperative (32%), open aortic repair (36%), endovascular repair (21%), and multimodality (10%). Overall mortality was 32%. Most deaths occurred during the initial operative exploration. The mortality rate of free aortic rupture was 100%. Intimal tears resolved or remained stable. Median follow-up was 15.5 months (range, 8 days-7.5 years). Vascular complications due to repair included a thrombosed access femoral artery during an endovascular repair and death of a patient who underwent a hybrid repair.\nCONCLUSIONS: This is the largest BAAI series described in the English literature at one institution. BAAIs range from intimal tears to free rupture, with outcomes and management correlating with type and location of injury. Nonoperative management with blood pressure control using β-blockers coupled with antiplatelet therapy and close follow-up is successful in individuals with intimal tears with minimal thrombus formation because they remain stable or resolve on follow-up. Free rupture remains a devastating injury, with 100% mortality. For all other categories of aortic injury, successful repair correlates with a favorable prognosis.",

        "Abstract":"INTRODUCTION: Third-generation hydroxyethyl starch (HES) is now approved also for the use in children, but safety studies including large numbers of pediatric patients are still missing. Therefore, we performed an European multicentric prospective observational postauthorization safety study (PASS) to evaluate the use of HES 130\/0.42\/6:1 in normal saline (ns-HES) or a balanced electrolyte solution (bal-HES) in children undergoing surgery.\nMETHODS: Children aged up to 12 years with ASA risk scores of I-III receiving ns-HES (Venofundin 6%; Braun) or bal-HES (Tetraspan 6%; Braun) were followed perioperatively. Demographic data, surgical procedures performed, anesthesia, hemodynamic and laboratory data, adverse events (AE), and adverse drug reactions (ADR) were documented using a standardized case report form.\nRESULTS: Of 1130 children studied at 11 European pediatric centers from 2006 to 2009 (ns-HES, 629 children; bal-HES, 475 children; mean age, 3.6 ± 3.8 [range, day of birth-12 years]; and body weight, 15.4 ± 13 [0.9-90 kg]), 1104 were included for analysis. The mean infused HES volume was 10.6 ± 5.8 (0.83-50) ml·kg(-1). In the 399 (36.1%) cases with blood gas analysis before and after HES infusion, hemoglobin and strong ion difference decreased significantly in both groups, whereas bicarbonate and base excess (BE before infusion: ns-HES -1.8 ± 3.1, bal-HES -1.2 ± 3.3 mm; after infusion: ns-HES -2.5 ± 2.8; bal-HES -1.1 ± 3.2 mm, P < 0.05) decreased only with ns-HES but remained stable with bal-HES. Chloride concentrations increased in both groups and were significantly higher with ns-HES (Cl before infusion: ns-HES 105.5 ± 3.6, bal-HES 104.9 ± 2.9 mm; Cl after infusion: ns-HES 107.6 ± 3.4, bal-HES 106.3 ± 2.9 mm, P < 0.05). For the AE\/ADR rates, dose-response but no age relationships could be demonstrated. No serious and no severe ADR directly related to HES (i.e. anaphylactoid reaction, clotting disorders, renal failure) were observed.\nCONCLUSION: Moderate doses of HES 130\/0.42\/6:1 for perioperative plasma volume replacement seem to be safe even in neonates and small infants. The probability of serious ADR is lower than 0.3%. Changes in acid-base balance may be decreased when HES is used in an acetate-containing balanced electrolyte solution instead of normal saline. Caution should be exercised in patients with renal function disturbances and those with an increased bleeding risk.",

        "Abstract":"AIMS More intense platelet-directed therapy for acute coronary syndrome (ACS) may increase bleeding risk. The aim of the current analysis was to determine the rate, clinical impact, and predictors of major and fatal bleeding complications in the PLATO study. METHODS AND RESULTS PLATO was a randomized, double-blind, active control international, phase 3 clinical trial in patients with acute ST elevation and non-ST-segment elevation ACS. A total of 18 624 patients were randomized to either ticagrelor, a non-thienopyridine, reversibly binding platelet P2Y(12) receptor antagonist, or clopidogrel in addition to aspirin. Patients randomized to ticagrelor and clopidogrel had similar rates of PLATO major bleeding (11.6 vs. 11.2%; P = 0.43), TIMI major bleeding (7.9 vs. 7.7%, P = 0.56) and GUSTO severe bleeding (2.9 vs. 3.1%, P = 0.22). Procedure-related bleeding rates were also similar. Non-CABG major bleeding (4.5 vs. 3.8%, P = 0.02) and non-procedure-related major bleeding (3.1 vs. 2.3%, P = 0.05) were more common in ticagrelor-treated patients, primarily after 30 days on treatment. Fatal bleeding and transfusion rates did not differ between groups. There were no significant interactions for major bleeding or combined minor plus major bleeding between treatment groups and age ≥75 years, weight <60 kg, region, chronic kidney disease, creatinine clearance <60 mL\/min, aspirin dose >325 mg on the day of randomization, pre-randomization clopidogrel administration, or clopidogrel loading dose. CONCLUSION Ticagrelor compared with clopidogrel was associated with similar total major bleeding but increased non-CABG and non-procedure-related major bleeding, primarily after 30 days on study drug treatment. Fatal bleeding was low and did not differ between groups.",

In this study, we evaluated the impact of prone and jackknife position on intra-abdominal pressure (IAP), lung mechanics, blood loss at the surgical site, and duration of the surgical procedure on lumbar disc operations.\nMETHODS: Forty patients operated for single-space lumber disc herniation were included in our study. All patients were ASA I-II and 18 to 70 years old. Patients who had undergone previous spinal surgery, were on anticoagulant or anti-aggregant therapy, had hypertension, cardiac, respiratory, liver, or renal disorders, and were obese (Body Mass Index >35 kg\/m²) were excluded. Patients were randomly assigned to either the prone or the jackknife position for surgery. Differences in lung mechanics, IAP, and surgical-site blood loss were calculated in both patient groups. Changes in pulmonary and abdominal pressure levels were measured both in face-up and down positions.\nRESULTS: Bleeding at the surgical site (prone: 180.0±100.0 mL, jackknife: 100.0±63.6 mL, P=0.018) and IAP (prone: 11.0±3.0 mm Hg, jackknife: 8.0±2.0 mm Hg, P=0.006) were significantly reduced when patients were in the jackknife position. Operating time was approximately 40 minutes shorter in the jackknife position group, although this difference was not significant.\nCONCLUSIONS: The jackknife position causes less IAP elevation and less surgical site bleeding compared with the prone position. The jackknife position is the preferred choice for single-level lumbar disc surgery in healthy, nonobese patients.",

Patients may experience thromboembolic events despite aspirin treatment, a phenomenon called aspirin resistance. We evaluated the frequency of aspirin resistance and its correlation with clinical and biochemical parameters among patients with nephrotic syndrome (NS).\nMETHODS: A total of 83 patients (50 males, 33 females, age range 18-79 years) with NS using aspirin 100 mg\/day were included in the study. Demographic information and aetiology of NS based on the histology of a renal biopsy were recorded for each patient. Blood samples were drawn to investigate the association of aspirin resistance with inflammation and thrombotic risk factors. Aspirin resistance was defined as a normal collagen\/epinephrine closure time<159 s using a platelet function analyzer (PFA-100).\nRESULTS: Aspirin resistance was determined in 51 patients (61.4%). The number of patients exposed to azathioprine therapy was significantly higher in the aspirin-sensitive group (P=0.043), whereas patients exposed to cyclosporine therapy were significantly higher in the aspirin-resistant group (P=0.017). More patients in the aspirin-resistant group were on angiotensin-converting enzyme inhibitor therapy compared with the aspirin-sensitive group (P=0.024). The aspirin-resistant group showed significantly higher serum low-density lipoprotein cholesterol (LDL-C) (151±47 versus 104±21 mg\/dL; P<0.001), triglyceride levels (192±116 versus 134±82 mg\/dL; P=0.015) and glomerular filtration rates (91.8±43.0 versus 74.0±35.6 mL\/min\/1.73 m2; P=0.044) compared with the aspirin-sensitive group. In multivariate analysis, LDL-C was the only parameter associated independently with aspirin resistance [odds ratio (OR) 1.04, 95% confidence interval (CI) 1.02-1.06; P=0.004].\nCONCLUSIONS: A significant number of patients with NS are resistant to aspirin therapy.

The time of onset of maximum neuromuscular block was 86.8 + 37.6 sec. in group H, 52 + 7.7 in group S and 80.1 + 30.8 in group P accordingly. As we can see, the shortest time with the smallest range of results was in the groups S, which indicates that the most predictable and most rapid onset of neuromuscular block can be reached during the sevoflurane anesthesia. The longest time for the onset of neuromuscular block was in the Halothane group, while the intermediate one was in the propofol group. For the most rapid and comfortable tracheal intubation the optimal combination is rocuronium in a dose of 0.6 mg\/kg (2 * ED90) with sevoflurane (52 + 7.7 sec). This method can be applied to case of emergency need for endotracheal intubation. Regardless of the anesthetic, the recovery time of the neuromuscular conduction changes inconsiderably reaching the secure level of TOF? 70% at laparoscopic operations for up to one hour, after which it is possible extubate the patient, which suggests t the predictability of rocuronium.",

        "Abstract":"OBJECTIVE: A pharmacodynamic interaction between clopidogrel and proton pump inhibitors (PPIs) has been suggested, leading to reduced clopidogrel-induced platelet inhibitory effects. However, data from clinical studies are conflicting. The aim of this study was to evaluate the safety of long-term clopidogrel and PPI therapy.\nMETHODS: A total of 1328 consecutive patients (age 63±11 years; 81% male) undergoing drug-eluting stent implantation and 1-year follow-up were included. All patients were treated with a standard aspirin and clopidogrel treatment regimen for 12 months. The concomitant PPI therapy for the same duration was at the discretion of the clinical cardiologist. PPI therapy included lansoprazole (30 mg\/day), pantoprazole (20 mg\/day), or omeprazole (20 mg\/day). At 1-year follow-up, major adverse cardiac events (MACE), defined as death, myocardial infarction (MI), acute coronary syndrome leading to hospitalization and nonfatal stroke, were recorded. All cause death, any stent thrombosis (ST), and bleeding (Thrombolysis in MI major and minor) were also assessed.\nRESULTS: Lansoprazole, pantoprazole, and omeprazole were administered to 855, 178, and 125 patients, whereas 170 were not prescribed any PPI therapy. Among patients treated with PPIs, those on pantoprazole had more often prior MI, multivessel coronary artery disease, and chronic kidney disease, whereas earlier peptic ulcer was more frequent among patients treated with omeprazole. The incidence of 1-year MACE was not statistically different between patients in the PPI and no-PPI groups (7.5 vs. 5.0%; P=0.26). Similarly, 1-year rates of all cause death, ST, and Thrombolysis in MI major and minor bleedings did not significantly differ. After statistical adjustment for potential confounders, the concomitant use of clopidogrel and PPIs was not associated with the risk of 1-year MACE [odds ratio (OR) 1.54, P=0.38], death (OR: 0.97, P=0.961), and ST (OR: 1.01, P=0.998). No differences across the three PPI types were found.\nCONCLUSION: The association of clopidogrel and PPIs after drug-eluting stent implantation, prescribed on clinical judgement, seems safe.",

Its efficacy has however been questioned by recent published data. It was the aim of this retrospective study to compare angioplasty with medical treatment in an unselected patient population.\nMETHODS: Data on 109 patients were retrospectively analysed. This cohort included all those patients admitted to the Lippe-Detmold Hospital between 1992 and 2008 for renal artery stenosis. The data included blood pressure, creatinine-based calculated glomerular filtration rate (cGFR), any renal dialysis, cardiovascular risk factors, events and survival time after transluminal renal angioplasty or drug treatment, respectively.\nRESULTS: Patients who had undergone angioplasty were younger (p = 0.04), had less cardiovascular co-morbidity (p < 0.01), but a higher degree of stenosis (p < 0.01). After a median follow-up of 32.5 (angioplasty) and 36.0 months (drug treatment), respectively, a significant decrease of cGFR was recorded in drug treated patients (- 16.2 ml\/min, 95 %, CI - 25.7 to - 6.7) but not in the angioplasty group (- 4.5 ml\/min, 95 %, CI - 13.5 to 4.5). There were no other significant differences were not observed.\nCONCLUSION: Younger patients with a high degree of renal artery stenosis but without generalized atherosclerosis more frequently underwent angioplasty in clinical practice.

        "Abstract":"AIMS: Wound healing is a major determent in the post-surgical course of patients (pts) after pacemaker (PM) and implantable cardioverter defibrillator (ICD) implantation. Insufficient closure may lead to serious complications with pocket infections leading to the device's explantation as the worst case scenario. In addition to the different types of suture and suture clips, a novel topical skin adhesive containing 2-octyl-cyanoacrylate is commercially available.\nMETHODS AND RESULTS: Over a period of 18 months, we prospectively assigned all cases of PM, ICD, and loop recorder implants either to skin adhesive (Group 1) or to absorbable intracutaneous polydioxanon suture (Group 2). Data were analysed with respect to operation time, wound infections, and healing disorders. One hundred and eighty-three pts were randomized into Group 1 [71 PMs, 60 ICD, 15 cardiac resynchronization therapy (CRT), 11 loop recorders, and 26 generator replacements]. One hundred and eighty-five pts were assigned to Group 2 (62 PMs, 70 ICD, 30 CRT, 7 loop recorders, and 16 generator replacements). There were no differences regarding sex, diabetes, renal insufficiency, corticosteroid therapy, oral anticoagulants, and acetylsalicylic asa\/clopidogrel (P = n.s.). For the significantly higher amount of CRT devices (P < 0.05) in Group 2, the procedure times are given for surgeries except CRT. It was 49.1 ± 27.7 min for Group 1 and 53.4 ± 31.9 min for Group 2 (P = n.s.). Adverse events as insufficient closure, major and minor bleeding, pocket haematoma, erythema, incrustation, dehiscence, keloid, and explantation due to infection occurred significantly more often in the adhesive group (P = 0.02). The greatest impact on this result had early adverse events as insufficient closure, wound incrustation, and inflammation (9.3 vs. 6.0%; P = 0.02). We did not find any difference in long-term adverse events, infections in particular (2.7 vs. 1.6%; P = 0.47).\nCONCLUSION: This study shows no benefit using skin adhesive in comparison to absorbable intracutaneous suture regarding surgery times for the implantation of cardiac rhythm devices. The rate of early adverse events after wound closure is higher after skin adhesive but no difference in long-term adverse events occurred.",

        "Published":null,
        "Abstract":"BACKGROUND: Thoracoabdominal aortic aneurysm (TAAA) repairs are technically challenging. The advent of endovascular aneurysm repair in combination with visceral\/renal artery bypasses has allowed for hybrid endovascular repair of these aneurysms. The purpose of this study was to evaluate whether outcomes were affected by the number of visceral\/renal artery reconstructions, conduit, or gender.\nMETHODS: All patients who underwent visceral\/renal bypass associated with an endovascular aortic aneurysm repair were prospectively studied in a vascular registry and retrospectively reviewed between the years 2004 and 2009. Patients undergoing standard open TAAA repair and those with aortic arch branch vessel reconstructions associated with thoracic endovascular repair were excluded from this analysis. Patients were segregated into two groups on the basis of number of vessels bypassed. Group 1 (n = 9) consisted of patients who required one or two bypasses, whereas group 2 (n = 15) consisted of patients who required three or four bypasses.\nRESULTS: A total of 64 TAAA repairs were performed. In all, 22 patients with hybrid repair and aortic arch vessel reconstructions and 18 patients with open TAAA repair were excluded from this analysis. A total of 24 (38%) patients with hybrid endovascular repair were evaluated in this study. The 30-day mortality was found to be 12.5% (3\/24) and the incidence of spinal cord ischemia was 8.3% (2\/24). Preoperative comorbidities and American Society of Anesthesia (ASA) scores were reported to be similar between the two groups. As compared with group 2, patients in group 1 were reported to be younger (69.7 ± 10.6 vs. 76.0 ± 5.7 years [p = 0.074]), had less blood loss (1,200 ± 1,088 mL vs. 3,119 ± 2,188 mL, [p = 0.06]), required fewer blood transfusions (5.33 ± 2.31 vs. 9.09 ± 7.06 units packed red blood cells (PRBC) [p = 0.39]), and had a shorter length of stay (11.4 ± 5.6 vs. 21.9 ± 15.1 days, [p = 0.090]). There was no difference in 30-day mortality rates between the two groups. The incidence of perioperative morbidity, including bowel ischemia (11%[1\/9] vs. 27% [4\/15], [p = 0.39]), myocardial infarction (11% [1\/9] vs. 13% [2\/15], [p = 0.88]), wound infection (0% vs. 27% [4\/15], [p = 0.09]), and pneumonia (11% [1\/9] vs. 40% [6\/15], [p = 0.14]) was found to be less in group 1 than group 2, but this difference was not significant. Patients with three or four bypasses had a significantly greater requirement for a skilled nursing facility or a rehabilitation facility after discharge (79% [11\/14] vs. 29% [2\/7], p = 0.026). There were no statistically significant differences in postoperative outcomes when comparing choice of conduit (autogenous or prosthetic) or gender. Results from the Cox-proportional hazards regression showed that bowel ischemia was the only postoperative complication associated with decreased survival (p = 0.037, confidence interval [0.1328-4.3075]).\nCONCLUSIONS: Hybrid aortic aneurysm repair carries a significant risk of patient morbidity with an acceptable mortality for patients considered to be at a high risk for standard thoracoabdominal repair. In patients requiring fewer visceral\/renal reconstructions, there is a trend toward fewer postoperative complications and a significantly shorter length of stay. Moreover, there is a significantly lower need for skilled nursing facility requirements after discharge from the hospital. Bowel ischemia is associated with significantly worse outcome and better attempts at avoiding this complication and aggressive management is indicated.",

His renal function deteriorated despite treatment with temocapril and aspirin, and dialysis treatment was started when he was 19. After nine yr of dialysis, he received a living kidney transplantation from his 58-yr-old father, who had a long history of hypertension. A graft biopsy before perfusion showed moderate arteriolosclerosis. As urine protein increased to 2.15 g\/d at 16 months after kidney transplantation, the graft biopsy was performed again. FSGS lesion with severe arteriosclerosis was recognized under light microscope, while the effacement of podocyte foot processes was seldom observed. The alteration of calcineurin inhibitor from cyclosporine to tacrolimus, combined with the new administration of angiotensin receptor antagonist (valsartan) and aldosterone receptor blocker, successfully decreased the amount of urine protein to 0.8 g\/d within two wk.

        "Abstract":"PURPOSE: The chronic effect of various analgesics on the progression of chronic kidney disease (CKD) is inconclusive. There is also lack of information on the renal safety of selective cyclooxygenase-2 (COX-2) inhibitors. This study aimed to clarify the renal risk of analgesic use in CKD patients.\nMETHODS: A cohort study using a nationally representative database randomly sampled from National Health Insurance (NHI) enrollees was performed. The study population included a total of 19,163 newly diagnosed CKD patients. Clinical conditions were defined by diagnostic codes and exposure information on analgesics was derived from service claims. Cox proportional hazard model was used to assess the association between analgesic use and the risk of progression to end stage renal disease (ESRD).\nRESULTS: CKD patients using acetaminophen, aspirin, and non-selective non-steroidal anti-inflammatory drugs (NSAIDs) had an increased risk for ESRD with multivariable-adjusted HRs (95%CIs) of 2.92 (2.47-3.45), 1.96 (1.62-2.36), and 1.56 (1.32-1.85), respectively. The trends toward higher risk with increasing exposure dose were significant for all classes of analgesics (all P for trend < 0.001). Among COX-2 inhibitors, only rofecoxib, but not celecoxib, shows a significant risk association with ESRD (HR = 1.98; 95%CI, 1.15-3.40).\nCONCLUSIONS: Our data indicated exacerbating effects of acetaminophen, aspirin, and non-selective NSAIDs on CKD in a dose-dependent manner. For COX-2 inhibitors, only rofecoxib showed an increased risk for ESRD. Although the possibility of residual confounding cannot be completely ruled out, given the common use of analgesics, the possible relation suggested by this study warrants further investigation.",

No definite data exist as to whether off-pump (OPCAB) is better than conventional on-pump coronary artery bypass grafting (CCAB) in terms of postoperative renal complications. Thus, we aimed to compare the renal outcomes of on-pump and off-pump coronary artery bypass grafting (CABG) on our patients, which constituted a predominantly Asian population.\nMATERIALS AND METHODS: A cohort of 395 patients following CCAB were compared with 293 patients who underwent OPCAB. Baseline demographics, comorbidities, intraoperative data, intensive care unit stay, number of grafts, New York Heart Association (NYHA) score, American Society of Anesthesiologists (ASA) score, EuroSCORE risk assessment model, and postoperative complications particularly renal, were collected and analysed.\nRESULTS: The off-pump group consisted of significantly older patients with higher Canadian Cardiovascular Society (CCS) and ASA scores. Additionally, the off-pump group involved a significantly greater number of smokers and chronic obstructive pulmonary disease (COPD) patients. Other demographic parameters were not different between the groups. Postoperative investigations showed a significantly elevated serum creatinine (100.3 +\/- 42.5 vs 127.6 +\/- 114.2 micromol\/L; off-pump vs on-pump; P = 0.039) and urea levels (5.9 +\/- 3.1 vs 10.6 +\/- 15.6 mg\/dL; off-pump vs on-pump; P = 0.006) in the on-pump group. Moreover, there was a high tendency towards a higher rate of renal dysfunction associated death in this group.\nCONCLUSIONS: OPCAB is a safe and equally efficient operative method compared to CCAB, and has a significant lower risk for postoperative renal complications as a treatment modality for surgical coronary revascularisation.",

However, the current literature suggests that not all patients who could benefit from warfarin receive the drug.\nOBJECTIVE: To evaluate patient-related demographic and clinical factors that could influence warfarin use or other anticoagulant use in hospitalized patients with AF.\nSTUDY DESIGN: Retrospective observational study using claims data from the Wolters Kluwer Pharma Solutions Hospital Patient Level Database, evaluating characteristics of patients hospitalized in the US between 1 November 2003 and 31 October 2004.\nSETTING: Hospital care.\nPATIENTS: The study included 44,193 patients aged >or=40 years who were hospitalized between 1 November 2003 and 31 October 2004 and had a diagnosis of AF during hospitalization (AF did not need to be the cause of hospitalization).\nINTERVENTIONS: Use of warfarin or other anticoagulants (unfractionated heparin [UFH] or low-molecular-weight heparin [LMWH]) was evaluated.\nMAIN OUTCOME MEASURES: A logistic regression model was used to identify factors associated with warfarin use, international normalized ratio (INR) monitoring, or the use of anticoagulants (UFH or LMWH).\nRESULTS: In this analysis of hospitalized patients with AF in the real-world setting, about 56% of patients received anticoagulation therapy with warfarin. Elderly patients aged >or=75 years were less likely to be treated with warfarin than younger patients, but patients between the ages of 60 and 74 years were more likely to use warfarin than their younger counterparts. Except for patients with congestive heart failure or vascular malformation, patients with other bleeding risk factors (hepatic disease, renal disease, aspirin use, and fractures) were significantly less likely to receive warfarin than those without these risk factors. CHADS(2) scores for stroke risk of 2 and 3 were associated with a significantly higher likelihood of warfarin treatment than scores of 0 or 1. Patients admitted through a routine admission (an outpatient department) were significantly more likely to be prescribed warfarin than patients admitted through an emergency room. Patients aged >or=75 years and aspirin users were more likely to have their INR monitored during hospitalization. With respect to other anticoagulant use, females and older patients (>or=65 years) were less likely to use UFH or LMWH, and patients with renal disease or vascular malformation and those receiving aspirin were more likely to use UFH or LMWH than patients without these conditions\/not receiving aspirin. Patients admitted through the emergency room were more likely to receive an anticoagulant than patients admitted through an outpatient department, an inpatient transfer, or any other source.\nCONCLUSIONS: Older age, female sex, and certain risk factors for bleeding, including hepatic disease, renal disease, aspirin use, and fractures, were associated with a lower likelihood of warfarin treatment, while a higher stroke risk (as indicated by CHADS(2) scores) was associated with a higher likelihood of warfarin treatment, in hospitalized patients with a diagnosis of AF. The likelihood of INR being monitored increased for patients aged >or=75 years and for aspirin users. Older patients and female patients were less likely to be prescribed other anticoagulants (UFH or LMWH) also.",

Effective ESWL requires a co-operative patient who will remain immobilize on the lithotripsy table comfortably for which different anaesthetic techniques are used. Occasionally discharge of patient is delayed due to persistent sedation, nausea and vomiting.\nOBJECTIVE: The aim is to assess the use of local anaesthetic agent (20 ml Lidocaine 1% ) infiltration in 60 patients (Experiment Group ) and no infiltration in 60 patients ( Control Group ) on patients undergoing Extracorporeal shock wave lithotripsy (ESWL) procedure.\nMATERIALS AND METHODS: is a study done in 120 patients of ASA I and ASA II patients undergoing ESWL procedure. The infiltration technique is standardized so that the local anesthetic agent was infiltrated five minutes before the procedure along the line of shockwave site in Experiment Group.\nRESULT: In this study, the age, sex, weight, time of shockwave treatment was almost similar in both groups. The mean need of Ketamine and duration of stay after procedure was significantly more in control group than experiment group.\nCONCLUSION: In this study, it is concluded that the need of Ketamine and duration of stay after procedure is significantly more in control group.",

        "Abstract":"BACKGROUND: Stent thrombosis (ST) is an uncommon but serious complication of drug-eluting and bare metal stents. To assess drug-eluting stent ST in contemporary practice, we analyzed 2-year data from the 7492-patient ARRIVE registry.\nMETHODS AND RESULTS: Patients were enrolled at the initiation of percutaneous coronary intervention with no inclusion\/exclusion criteria beyond use of the paclitaxel-eluting TAXUS stent. Two-year follow-up was 94% with independent adjudication of major cardiac events. A second, autonomous committee adjudicated Academic Research Consortium (ARC) definite\/probable ST. Cumulative 2-year ARC-defined ST was 2.6% (1.0% early ST [<30 days], 0.7% late ST [31 to 365 days], and 0.8% very late ST [>1 year]). Simple-use (single-vessel and single-stent) cases had lower rates than expanded use (broader patient\/lesion characteristics, 2-year cumulative: 1.4% versus 3.3%, P<0.001; early ST: 0.4% versus 1.4%, P<0.001; late ST: 0.5% versus 0.8%, P=0.14; very late ST: 0.4% versus 1.0%, P=0.008). Within 7 days of ST, 23% of patients died; 28% suffered Q-wave myocardial infarction. Mortality was higher with early ST (39%) than late ST (12%, P<0.001) or very late ST (13%, P<0.001). Multivariate analysis showed anatomic factors increased early ST (lesion >28 mm, lesion calcification) and late ST (vessel <3.0 mm); biological factors increased very late ST (renal disease, prior brachytherapy). Although early ST (71.4%) and very late ST (23.1%) patients had dual antiplatelet therapy at the time of ST, premature thienopyridine discontinuation was a strong independent predictor of both.\nCONCLUSIONS: The relative risks of early and late ST differ. Knowledge of ST risk for specific subgroups may guide revascularization options until the completion of randomized trials in these broad populations.",

        "Abstract":"OBJECTIVE: Low-dose aspirin (LDA) given during pregnancy may alter brain development in very preterm infants. We report the short- and long-term outcomes of very preterm infants according to LDA treatment.\nPATIENTS AND METHODS: Data were from the Etude Epidemiologique des Petites Ages Gestationnels (EPIPAGE) cohort study, which included all infants born before 33 weeks of gestation in 9 French regions in 1997. This study was restricted to 656 children who were born to 584 women with an obstetric history of placental vascular disease or with chronic hypertension or renal or autoimmune diseases. The main outcome measures were mortality, cerebral lesions, and outcome at 5 years of age, which were measured by a diagnosis of cerebral palsy; behavioral difficulties, which were assessed with the Strength and Difficulties Questionnaire; and cognitive impairment, which was measured by the mental processing composite scale of the Kaufman Assessment Battery for Children (an IQ-equivalent measure of cognitive ability in 2 dimensions: sequential and simultaneous processing scores).\nRESULTS: LDA treatment was administered to 125 of 584 (21%) mothers and was not significantly associated with mortality, cerebral lesions, cerebral palsy, or global cognitive impairment of the children at 5 years of age. The proportion of low simultaneous processing scores (<70) was lower in the group with LDA (7% vs 19% without LDA; P = .04). This association was not significant after adjustment for propensity score, prognostic factors, and social class (adjusted odds ratio [aOR]: 0.59 [95% confidence interval (CI): 0.17-2.06]). LDA treatment was associated with a reduction, at the limit of significance, in total behavioral difficulties (aOR: 0.44 [95% CI: 0.19-1.02]) and hyperactivity (aOR: 0.43 [95% CI: 0.17-1.05]).\nCONCLUSIONS: LDA was not associated with adverse neonatal or long-term outcomes. Moreover, the results suggest that LDA may be associated with a reduction in neurobehavioral difficulties.

        "Published":"2009-11-21",
        "Abstract":"OBJECTIVES: This review attempts to bring together information from a large number of recent studies on the clinical uses, safety and pharmacological properties of ibuprofen. Ibuprofen is widely used in many countries for the relief of symptoms of pain, inflammation and fever. The evidence for modes of action of ibuprofen are considered in relation to its actions in controlling inflammation, pain and fever, as well as the adverse effects of the drug.\nSUMMARY OF OUTCOMES: At low doses (800-1,200 mg day(-1)) which in many countries are approved for non-prescription (over-the-counter) sale ibuprofen has a good safety profile comparable with paracetamol. Its analgesic activity is linked to its anti-inflammatory effects and is related to reduction in the ex vivo production in blood of cyclo-oxygenase (COX)-1 and COX-2 derived prostanoids. Higher prescription doses (circa 1,800-2,400 mg day(-1)) are employed long-term for the treatment of rheumatic and other more severe musculo-skeletal conditions. Recent evidence from large-scale clinical trials with the newer coxibs, where ibuprofen was as a comparator, have confirmed earlier studies which have shown that ibuprofen has comparable therapeutic benefits with coxibs and other NSAIDs. For long-term usage (6+ months) there are greater numbers of drop-outs due to reduced effectiveness of therapy, a feature which is common with NSAIDs. Spontaneous reports of adverse events and adverse drug reactions (ADRs) in clinical trails from long-term coxib comparator studies, as well as in epidemiological studies, shows that ibuprofen has relatively low risks for gastro-intestinal (GI), hepato-renal and other, rarer, ADRs compared with other NSAIDs and coxibs. A slightly higher risk of cardiovascular (CV) events has been reported in some, but not all studies, but the risks are in general lower than with some coxibs and diclofenac. The possibility that ibuprofen may interfere with the anti-platelet effects of aspirin, though arguably of low grade or significance, has given rise to caution on its use in patients that are at risk for CV conditions that take aspirin for preventing these conditions. Paediatric use of ibuprofen is reviewed and the main results are that the drug is relatively safe and effective as a treatment of acute pain and fever. It is probably more effective than paracetamol as an antipyretic.\nCONCLUSIONS: This assessment of the safety and benefits of ibuprofen can be summarized thus: (1) Ibuprofen at OTC doses has low possibilities of serious GI events, and little prospect of developing renal and associated CV events. Ibuprofen OTC does not represent a risk for developing liver injury especially the irreversible liver damage observed with paracetamol and the occasional liver reactions from aspirin. (2) The pharmacokinetic properties of ibuprofen, especially the short plasma half-life of elimination, lack of development of pathologically related metabolites (e.g. covalent modification of liver proteins by the quinine-imine metabolite of paracetamol or irreversible acetylation of biomolecules by aspirin) are support for the view that these pharmacokinetic and notably metabolic effects of ibuprofen favour its low toxic potential. (3) The multiple actions of ibuprofen in controlling inflammation combine with moderate inhibition of COX-1 and COX-2 and low residence time of the drug in the body may account for the low GI, CV and renal risks from ibuprofen, especially at OTC doses.",

        "Abstract":"BACKGROUND: Inguinal herniorrhaphy can be successfully performed using general, regional or local anaesthesia. Paravertebral block (PVB) has been used for unilateral procedures such as thoracotomy, breast surgery, chest wall trauma, hernia repair or renal surgery.\nMETHODS: We compared unilateral lumbar PVB with conventional spinal anaesthesia (SA) in 60 consenting ASA I and II males aged 18-65 years, scheduled for unilateral inguinal hernia repair. Patients were randomly assigned into two groups, P (n=30) or S (n=30) to receive either PVB or SA, respectively. Two patients (7%) in group P had to be converted to general anaesthesia due to block failure. During surgery, patients of both groups received intravenous infusion of propofol titrated to light sedation.\nRESULTS: The time to first post-operative analgesic requirement (primary outcome measure) as 342 +\/- 73 min in group P and 222 +\/- 22 min in group S (P<0.0001). Time to ambulation was 234 +\/- 111 min in group P and 361 +\/- 32 min in group S (P<0.0001).

        "Abstract":"Several newer anticoagulants are under clinical development. Recently two of them, Dabigatran etexilate\/Pradaxa. and Rivaroxaban\/Xarelto obtained marketing authorization in Europe and Canada for the prevention of thromboembolic events following major orthopedic surgery such as total hip and knee replacement. The results of Phase III clinical studies in thromboprophylaxis in major orthopedic surgery are highlighted and discussed in detail. Ongoing Phase II and III clinical trials assess their efficacy in the secondary prevention and treatment of deep vein thrombosis and pulmonary embolism, and in the long-term prevention of stroke in patients with non-valvular atrial fibrillation and in combination with aspirin and clopidogrel in patients with acute coronary syndromes. Many other small antithrombotic molecules including a new generation of low molecular weight heparins, are currently in different stages of clinical development. In addition to being administered orally, the newer anticoagulant agents have a more balanced benefit\/risk ratio and wider therapeutic window. They have a rapid onset of action, a predictable anticoagulant effect that does not require routine laboratory monitoring. They have minor food and drug interactions, including those with cytochrome P450 and P.gp. They are highly specific and targeted to a single coagulation factor, and could carry similar or less hemorrhagic risks compared to the older anticoagulant agents. Finally, they may be used in a broader variety of patients, especially the medically ill patients with advanced cancer, and the elderly without any dosage adjustment, regardless of the patient age, gender, body weight, or in patients with mild renal impairment. Their use in the general world will hopefully confirm the promising results of clinical trials.",

Frequency of and predictors for routine OTC drug and HT use are not well studied.\nMETHODS AND RESULTS: We examined routine use of OTC drug and HT in patients at 8 medical centers. Medical conditions independently associated with use of OTC drugs, HT, or both were assessed using multivariable logistic regression models. Of 374 subjects, OTC drug and HT were routinely used by 349 and 43 patients, respectively. Mean age was 69.6 +\/- 13.1 years, 63% were male, and 81% were Caucasian. Common OTC drugs were antiplatelets (baby-dose aspirin), vitamins, acetaminophen, antacids, laxatives, and calcium. The most common HT used was echinacea.

Adjuvant therapies such as immunoglobulin, anticoagulants, and vitamins have been used with conventional treatments despite a lack of evidence of their efficacy.\nOBJECTIVE: The aim of this study was to review the scientific literature regarding adjuvant treatments administered with conventional drugs in the treatment of childhood HSPN.\nMETHODS: Published articles were identified from the MEDLINE and EMBASE databases (1988-December 2008; key words: Henoch-Schönlein nephritis and Henoch-Schönlein purpura). The search was limited to published English-language studies on therapeutic options for HSPN in children.\nRESULTS: A total of 12 studies were identified and included in this review; most (n = 8) were case series or retrospective studies. Studies of conventional therapy combined with adjuvant treatment should be interpreted with caution. In particular, factor XIII administration was reported to improve kidney symptoms in 1 study. Based on the results from 9 studies, no convincing evidence on intravenous immunoglobu-lin, urokinase, or anticoagulants was identified. No substantial information was available on the benefit of antiplatelet agents or heparin in treating HSPN. Integrating treatment with vitamin E was not recommended based on the results from 1 randomized controlled trial. Fish oil was reported to be effective in 1 case series.\nCONCLUSIONS: Studies concerning the treatment of HSPN in children with adjuvant therapies were retrospective and recommendations were drawn from level IV evidence. One randomized controlled trial on the use of tocopherol as adjuvant treatment was identified; however, no clinical utility was reported.

The effect of renal revascularization on left ventricular mass is not known.\nAIM: The Stenting of Renal Artery Stenosis in Coronary Artery Disease (RAS-CAD) study is a randomized trial designed to study the effect of medical therapy alone versus medical therapy plus renal artery stenting, on left ventricular hypertrophy progression (primary end point), and CV morbidity and mortality (secondary end points), in patients affected by ischemic heart disease and RAS.\nMETHODS: From April 2006 on, all consecutive patients undergoing nonemergent coronary angiography at a single institution are also to be evaluated for RAS by selective renal arteriography. Patients with RAS>50% and <or=80% are randomly assigned to undergo stenting angioplasty plus medical therapy (angioplasty group) or medical therapy alone (drug therapy group) and followed up for 5 years. All randomized patients receive antihypertensive, lipid-lowering or antiplatelet drugs according to current clinical guidelines. The estimated sample size needed to achieve a 80% power to detect as statistically significant a 4 g\/m2 difference in left ventricular mass index progression (p<0.01, 2-tailed) between the 2 arms is 168 (84 in the revascularization arm and 84 in the medical management arm).",

        "Abstract":"INTRODUCTION: The advanced age of the recipient is considered a \"relative contraindication\" to liver transplantation (LT). However, recently some studies reported a morbidity rate and an overall survival comparable with those of younger patients. Here, we reported the outcome after LT in recipients aged >65 yr.\nMETHODS: Between January 2000 and December 2006, 565 LT was performed in 502 recipients in our institution. Of these, 34 were recipients of >65 yr old (aged group). We focused our study comparing: donor age, co-morbidities, model for end-stage liver disease (MELD) and American Society of Anesthesiologists (ASA) score, duration of operation, transfusions and outcome between the two groups (young\/aged).\nRESULTS: For the group aged >65: the mean donor age was 52.5 (range 16-75) yr and the graft weight 1339 g (890-1880 g). Co-morbidity was recorded in 25 (73.5%), coronary artery disease (CAD) in 17 (50%), diabetes mellitus (DM) and chronic renal insufficiency in four (11.7%) and chronic obstructive pulmonary disease (COPD) in three patients (8.8%). Mean MELD score was 14.9 (range 12-29) and ASA score was two in 15 (44.1%); and three in 19 (55.8%) recipients. Mean operation time was four h 45 min, three patients also received combined kidney transplantation. Twenty-five (73.5%) recipients received blood transfusions (mean 3.2). Morbidity was observed in 20 patients (58.8%); of these two had hepatic artery thrombosis requiring re-LT. Overall survival was 80% (40 months of follow-up), in particularly, at 30-d, one yr, three yr was 91%, 84%, 80%, respectively. The only two statistical differences reported (p = 0.02) are: the lower rate of CAD in the younger group of recipients (12%), compared with the aged group (50%) and the subsequently lower mortality rate secondary to cardiac causes in the younger group (1.4%) compared with aged group (8.8%).\nCONCLUSION: Our results suggest that the recipient age should not be considered an absolute contraindication for LT when the graft\/recipient matching is optimal and when an adequate cardiac assessment is performed.",

        "Abstract":"OBJECTIVE: The 1997 update of the American College of Rheumatology classification criteria (ACR97) for systemic lupus erythematosus (SLE) has not been validated. We determined to what extent their introduction influenced the epidemiology and clinical characteristics of the disease in northern Norway.\nMETHODS: Annual incidence and point-prevalence rates, clinical manifestations, and outcome were determined in an inception cohort of patients with SLE in northern Norway, included between 1996 and 2006, using ACR97 criteria (97acr). These findings were compared with a cohort from the same area enrolled 1978-1995 using the 1982 revised criteria ACR82 (82acr).\nRESULTS: The mean annual incidence of SLE was 3.00 for cohort 97acr (n = 58) versus 2.63 for cohort 82acr (n = 81) (p = 0.5). All patients in the 97acr cohort also fulfilled the 1982 criteria; however, significantly fewer patients presented with discoid rash [odds ratio (OR) 0.31)], arthritis (OR 0.24), renal (OR 0.28) or hematological disorder (OR 0.27), and significantly more with anti-dsDNA (OR 2.57) and antiphospholipid antibodies (OR 27.9). Initial treatment with intravenous pulse methylprednisolone (OR 9.23), azathioprine (OR 6.32), and low-dose aspirin (OR 20.9) was increased in cohort 97acr. Five- (95.2%) and 10-year survival (91.9%) rates were also improved for cohort 97acr.\nCONCLUSION: The ACR97 criteria set has construct validity compared to the ACR82 criteria set. SLE incidence remains unchanged in northern Norway, but a significant reduction of renal disease and further improvements in survival rates occurred simultaneously with increased serological surveillance with ELISA-based assays and early immunosuppressive and anticoagulant therapy.",

Clinical studies have demonstrated that decreased responsiveness to ASA therapy is associated with an increased risk of atherothrombotic events. However, no clinical trial to date has evaluated the incidence and clinical importance of ASA resistance among renal transplant recipients.\nAIM: To assess the incidence of ASA resistance and its association with cardiovascular risk factors (CRF) and renal graft function after renal transplantation.\nMETHODS: We prospectively included 40 patients undergoing living related donor renal transplantation using ASA (80 mg\/d) in the study. ASA resistance was defined using a platelet function analyzer (PFA-100). Glomerular filtration rate (GFR) was measured by postoperative Tc-99m diethylenetriaminepentaacetic acid renal scintigraphy. We investigated the incidence of ASA resistance and its relationship to CRF and renal graft function.\nRESULTS: ASA resistance was noted in 11 patients (27.5%). The demographic characteristics of the patients were similar in both groups (P > .05). Compared with patients in the ASA-sensitive group, patients in the ASA-resistant group showed significantly higher total cholesterol, low-density lipoprotein cholesterol, triglyceride, C-reactive protein, and fibrinogen levels and lower GFRs (44 +\/- 21 mL\/min vs 63 +\/- 26 mL\/min, P = .03).

        "Published":null,
        "Abstract":"OBJECTIVE: To review the obstetrical outcomes associated with abnormally elevated or decreased level of one or more of the most frequently measured maternal serum marker analytes used in screening for aneuploidy. To provide guidance to facilitate the management of pregnancies that have abnormal levels of one of more markers and to assess the usefulness of these markers as a screening test.\nOPTIONS: Perinatal outcomes associated with abnormal levels of maternal serum markers analytes are compared with the outcomes of pregnancies with normal levels of the same analytes or the general population.\nEVIDENCE: The Cochrane Library and Medline were searched for English-language articles published from 1966 to February 2007, relating to maternal serum markers and perinatal outcomes. Search terms included PAPP-A (pregnancy associated plasma protein A), AFP (alphafetoprotein), hCG (human chorionic gonadotropin), estriol, unconjugated estriol, inhibin, inhibin-A, maternal serum screen, triple marker screen, quadruple screen, integrated prenatal screen, first trimester screen, and combined prenatal screen. All study types were reviewed. Randomized controlled trials were considered evidence of the highest quality, followed by cohort studies. Key individual studies on which the recommendations are based are referenced. Supporting data for each recommendation are summarized with evaluative comments and references. The evidence was evaluated using the guidelines developed by the Canadian Task Force on Preventive Health Care.\nVALUES: The evidence collected was reviewed by the Genetics Committee of the Society of Obstetricians and Gynaecologists of Canada.\nBENEFITS, HARMS, AND COSTS: The benefit expected from this guideline is to facilitate early detection of potential adverse pregnancy outcomes when risks are identified at the time of a maternal serum screen. It will help further stratification of risk and provide options for pregnancy management to minimize the impact of pregnancy complications. The potential harms resulting from such practice are associated with the so called false positive (i.e., uncomplicated pregnancies labelled at increased risk for adverse perinatal outcomes), the potential stress associated with such a label, and the investigations performed for surveillance in this situation. No cost-benefit analysis is available to assess costs and savings associated with this guideline. SUMMARY STATEMENTS: 1. An unexplained level of a maternal serum marker analyte is defined as an abnormal level after confirmation of gestational age by ultrasound and exclusion of maternal, fetal, or placental causes for the abnormal level. (III) 2. Abnormally elevated levels of serum markers are associated with adverse pregnancy outcomes in twin pregnancies, after correction for the number of fetuses. Spontaneous or planned mutifetal reductions may result in abnormal elevations of serum markers. (II-2) RECOMMENDATIONS: 1. In the first trimester, an unexplained low PAPP-A (< 0.4 MoM) and\/or a low hCG (< 0.5 MoM) are associated with an increased frequency of adverse obstetrical outcomes, and, at present, no specific protocol for treatment is available. (II-2A) In the second trimester, an unexplained elevation of maternal serum AFP (> 2.5 MoM), hCG (> 3.0 MoM), and\/or inhibin-A (> or =2.0 MoM) or a decreased level of maternal serum AFP (< 0.25 MoM) and\/or unconjugated estriol (< 0.5 MoM) are associated with an increased frequency of adverse obstetrical outcomes, and, at present, no specific protocol for treatment is available. (II-2A) 2. Pregnant woman with an unexplained elevated PAPP-A or hCG in the first trimester and an unexplained low hCG or inhibin-A and an unexplained elevated unconjugated estriol in the second trimester should receive normal antenatal care, as this pattern of analytes is not associated with adverse perinatal outcomes. (II-2A) 3. The combination of second or third trimester placenta previa and an unexplained elevated maternal serum AFP should increase the index of suspicion for placenta accreta, increta, or percreta. (II-2B) An assessment (ultrasound, MRI) of the placental-uterine interface should be performed. Abnormal invasion should be strongly suspected, and the planning of delivery location and technique should be done accordingly. (III-C) 4. A prenatal consultation with the medical genetics department is recommended for low unconjugated estriol levels (<0.3 MoM), as this analyte pattern can be associated with genetic conditions. (II-2B) 5. The clinical management protocol for identification of potential adverse obstetrical outcomes should be guided by one or more abnormal maternal serum marker analyte value rather than the false positive screening results for the trisomy 21 and\/or the trisomy 18 screen. (II-2B) 6. Pregnant woman who are undergoing renal dialysis or who have had a renal transplant should be offered maternal serum screening, but interpretation of the result is difficult as the level of serum hCG is not reliable. (II-2A) 7. Abnormal maternal uterine artery Doppler in association with elevated maternal serum AFP, hCG, or inhibin-A or decreased PAPP-A identifies a group of women at greater risk of IUGR and gestational hypertension with proteinuria. Uterine artery Doppler measurements may be used in the evaluation of an unexplained abnormal level of either of these markers. (II-2B) 8. Further research is recommended to identify the best protocol for pregnancy management and surveillance in women identified at increased risk of adverse pregnancy outcomes based on an abnormality of a maternal serum screening analyte. (III-A) 9. In the absence of evidence supporting any specific surveillance protocol, an obstetrician should be consulted in order to establish a fetal surveillance plan specific to the increased obstetrical risks (maternal and fetal) identified. This plan may include enhanced patient education on signs and symptoms of the most common complications, increased frequency of antenatal visits, increased ultrasound (fetal growth, amniotic fluid levels), and fetal surveillance (biophysical profile, arterial and venous Doppler), and cervical length assessment. (III-A) 10. Limited information suggests that, in women with elevated hCG in the second trimester and\/or abnormal uterine artery Doppler (at 22-24 weeks), low-dose aspirin (60-81 mg daily) is associated with higher birthweight and lower incidence of gestational hypertension with proteinuria. This therapy may be used in women who are at risk. (II-2B) 11. Further studies are recommended in order to assess the benefits of low-dose aspirin, low molecular weight heparin, or other therapeutic options in pregnancies determined to be at increased risk on the basis of an abnormal maternal serum screening analyte. (III-A) 12. Multiple maternal serum markers screening should not be used at present as a population-based screening method for adverse pregnancy outcomes (such as preeclampsia, placental abruption, and stillbirth) outside an established research protocol, as sensitivity is low, false positive rates are high, and no management protocol has been shown to clearly improve outcomes. (II-2D) When maternal serum screening is performed for the usual clinical indication (fetal aneuploidy and\/or neural tube defect), abnormal analyte results can be utilized for the identification of pregnancies at risk and to direct their clinical management. (II-2B) Further studies are recommended to determine the optimal screening method for poor maternal and\/or perinatal outcomes. (III-A).",

        "Abstract":"BACKGROUND: Adverse drug reactions (ADRs) are a significant cause of morbidity and mortality.\nMETHODS: A prospective study was conducted over a 6-month period. All patients consecutively admitted were enrolled in the study. Analysis included: (1) an evaluation of the frequency of ADR-related hospital admissions and their causality, severity, and preventability; (2) a description of the type of drugs involved; (3) a report of the most common clinical manifestations related to these ADRs; and (4) an assessment of the factors that were predictive of ADRs.\nRESULTS: Seventy of the 548 admissions (12.8%) were related to an ADR. Hemorrhage represented the most common ADR (37.3%), followed by metabolic and renal events (10.8% each). The drugs most often involved were non-steroid anti-inflammatory drugs (NSAIDs), followed by diuretics, aspirin, oral anticoagulants, and oral hypoglycemic agents. A comparison between ADR and non-ADR-related admissions showed that mean number of medications and age were significantly higher for patients admitted for an ADR than for those who were not. Gender, chronic disease at admission, days of hospitalization, cognitive impairment, renal insufficiency, physical activity impairment, and use of psychoactive drugs did not differ between the two groups. In the multivariate analysis, number of drugs was the only independent predictor of ADR-related hospital admission (OR=1.064, 95% CI 1.019-1.109). In 13 of 70 (18.6%) ADR-related hospital admissions, ADRs were coded as severe.\nCONCLUSIONS: ADRs are common causes of hospital admissions and may have important consequences. The most important determinant for ADR-related hospital admissions is the number of drugs taken.",

        "Abstract":"Hypertensive disorders are the most common medical disorders of pregnancy and are associated with adverse maternal and perinatal outcomes. When considering pregnancy, women with pre-existing chronic hypertension should be screened for target organ damage, especially renal dysfunction. Since blood pressure usually decreases until midpregnancy and returns to, or exceeds, prepregnancy values in the third trimester, antihypertensive treatment can sometimes be withdrawn in low-risk women, and reintroduced if needed. Recommended antihypertensive drugs are labetalol, methyldopa and nifedipine. Angiotensin converting enzyme inhibitors, angiotensin II receptor antagonists and atenolol must be avoided. The occurrence of superimposed preeclampsia should be detected by appropriate clinical and laboratory evaluation. Preeclampsia is a multisystem maternal and fetal syndrome. The risk of preeclampsia is slightly reduced by low-dose aspirin and by calcium supplementation in women with low dietary calcium intake. For early-onset preeclampsia, expectant management improves perinatal outcomes, but requires close maternal and fetal surveillance. For acute management of severe hypertension, intravenous labetalol and oral nifedipine are recommended. Delivery is indicated in the presence of signs of maternal or fetal distress. Magnesium sulfate is indicated for the prophylaxis and the treatment of eclampsia. Most antihypertensive agents are compatible with breast feeding. Early-onset or severe preeclampsia increase the risk of remote chronic hypertension and cardiovascular disease.",

        "Abstract":"Fibromuscular dysplasia (FMD) reminds of a rare form of secondary arterial hypertension occurring in young people and involving the renal arteries. FMD may also involve vertebral, subclavian, mesenteric, iliac arteries and carotid arteries. FMD of internal carotid arteries is a rare finding that is frequently incidental and asymptomatic. It usually occurs in middle-aged women and is secondary to media-intima fibrodysplasia. The carotid artery may be elongated or kinked and associated cerebral aneurysms have been reported. Symptoms including transient ischaemic attack or stroke are uncommon and are related to decrease of blood flow or embolization by platelet aggregates. At the onset, differential diagnosis with vasculitis must be placed. Computed tomography or magnetic resonance imaging (MRI) angiography demonstrates bilateral high-grade stenosis with the characteristic \"string of beads\" pattern. Antiplatelet medication is the accepted therapy for asymptomatic lesions. Graduated endoluminal surgical dilation is an outmoded therapy, no longer used in most medical centres. Current percutaneous angioplasty is the preferred treatment for symptomatic carotid FMD, but no randomized controlled trials comparing this methodology with surgery is available. The management of a case of arterial systemic FMD in a 52-year-old women, diagnosed after a hypertensive crysis, is discussed. Imaging methods disclosed stenoses of carotid arteries, of celiac tripod and of superior mesenteric artery. Because of high risk associated to endovascular surgery, medical therapy was started.

We have evaluated tramadol, a centrally acting opioid analgesic with muscarinic receptor antagonist properties for prevention of CRBD.\nMETHODS: Fifty-four adults (18-60 yr), ASA physical status I and II of either sex, undergoing elective percutaneous nephro-lithomy were randomly divided into two groups of 27 each. Control (C) group received normal saline (NS; 2 ml), whereas Tramadol (T) group received tramadol 1.5 mg kg(-1). All medications were diluted in 2 ml NS and administered 30 min before extubation. Intra-operatively, urinary catherization was performed with a 16 Fr Foley's catheter, and the balloon was inflated with 10 ml distilled water. The CRBD was assessed at 0, 1, 2, and 6 h after patient's arrival in the post-anaesthesia care unit along with total postoperative fentanyl requirement. Severity of CRBD was graded as none, mild, moderate and severe. Data were analysed by one-way ANOVA, Z-test, and Fisher's exact test.

        "Published":"2008-06-18",
        "Abstract":"BACKGROUND: Only few data are available on pregnancy in patients with lupus nephritis (LN) diagnosed before conception. The aim of this study was to identify the risk factors for complicated pregnancy in women with pre-existing LN.\nMETHODS: In a multicentre study, we collected data on 113 pregnancies occurring in 81 women with pre-existing biopsy-proven LN. Primary outcomes were fetal loss including perinatal death and renal flares during and 12 months after pregnancy. Univariate and logistic regression analyses were used to identify predictors of outcomes.\nRESULTS: Renal biopsy performed 7.2 +\/- 4.9 years before pregnancy showed the following WHO classes: 6 patients in II, 8 in III, 48 in IV and 19 in V. At conception, most patients were in complete (49%) or partial (27%) remission. There were nine spontaneous abortions, one stillbirth and five neonatal deaths. Thirty-one deliveries were preterm. Birth weight was <2500 g in 34 newborns. During pregnancy or after delivery, there were 34 renal flares, most of which (20) were reversible. Three patients had a progressive decline of glomerular filtration rate (one on dialysis). At logistic regression analysis, the pregnancy outcome was predicted by hypocomplementaemia at conception (RR 19.02; 90% CI 4.58-78.96) and aspirin during pregnancy (RR 0.11; 90% CI 0.03-0.38). Renal flare was predicted by renal status (partial remission RR 3.0; 90% CI 1.23-7.34, nonremission RR 9.0; 90% CI 3.59-22.57).\nCONCLUSIONS: Pregnancy can be successful in most women with pre-existing LN, even for those with a severe renal involvement at onset. Renal flares during and after pregnancy are not uncommon and can be predicted by renal status assessed before pregnancy. Normocomplementaemia and low-dose aspirin therapy during pregnancy are independent predictors of a favourable fetal outcome.",

        "Published":"2008-02-21",
        "Abstract":"BACKGROUND: Mild and moderate chronic kidney disease (CKD) is associated with decreased survival and increased adverse events after a percutaneous coronary intervention (PCI). Therapy with clopidogrel decreases adverse events in large patient populations. Therefore, we sought to determine the efficacy and safety of long-term clopidogrel therapy in patients with CKD.\nMETHODS: Two thousand two patients from the CREDO trial in whom an elective PCI of a single or multiple vessels was planned were analyzed. Patients were randomly assigned to a 300-mg loading dose of clopidogrel before PCI followed by clopidogrel 75 mg\/d for a year versus a placebo loading dose at the time of the PCI procedure and clopidogrel 75 mg\/d for 28 days and placebo for the remainder of a year. Patients were categorized by their estimated creatinine clearance (>90 [normal, n = 999], 60-89 [mild CKD, n = 672], <60 mL\/min [moderate CKD, n = 331]).\nRESULTS: Diminished renal function was associated with worse outcomes. Patients with normal renal function who received 1 year of clopidogrel had a marked reduction in death, myocardial infarction, or stroke compared with those who received placebo (10.4% vs 4.4%, P < .001), whereas patients with mild and moderate CKD did not have a significant difference in outcomes with clopidogrel therapy versus placebo (mild: 12.8% vs 10.3%, P = .30; moderate: 13.1% vs 17.8%, P = .24). Clopidogrel use was associated with an increased relative risk of major or minor bleeding, but this increased risk was not different based on renal function (relative risk 1.2, 1.3, 1.1).\nCONCLUSIONS: Clopidogrel in mild or moderate CKD patients may not have the same beneficial effect as it does in patients with normal renal function, but was not associated with a greater relative risk of bleeding based on renal function. Further studies are needed to define the role of clopidogrel therapy in patients with CKD.",

        "Abstract":"Peripheral arterial occlusive disease (PAD) is a highly prevalent atherosclerotic syndrome associated with significant morbidity and mortality. It is defined by atherosclerotic obstruction of the abdominal aorta and arteries to the legs that reduces arterial flow during exercise and\/or at rest, and is a common manifestation of systemic atherosclerosis. PAD represents a marker for premature cardiovascular events, and in patients with PAD, even in the absence of a history of myocardial infarction (MI) or ischemic stroke, they have approximately the same relative risk of death from cardiovascular causes as do patients with a history of coronary or cerebrovascular disease. In addition, their death rate from all causes is approximately equal in men and women and is elevated even in asymptomatic patients. The major risk factors for PAD are the well defined atherosclerotic risks such as diabetes mellitus, cigarette smoking, advanced age, hyperlipidemia, and hypertension. Due to the presence of these risk factors, the systemic nature of atherosclerosis, and the high risk of ischemic events, patients with PAD should be candidates for aggressive secondary prevention strategies including aggressive risk factor modification, antiplatelet therapy, lipid lowering therapy and antihypertensive treatment. This article reviews the current medical treatment and risk factor modification of patients with PAD.",

        "Abstract":"UNLABELLED: As the effect of Fontan circulation on the kidneys has not been defined, the purpose of this study was to determine whether it is associated with nephropathy.\nMETHODS: Patients with single ventricle physiology at least 2 years after Fontan procedure with normal cardiac function by echocardiography, history of normal renal ultrasound, and no co-morbidities known to affect the kidneys were evaluated. Patient's demographics, diagnoses, pre- and post-Fontan catheterization data, and current medications were collected. A current glomerular filtration rate (eGFR) was calculated. Morning urine samples were collected for microalbumin\/creatinine ratio (MCR).\nRESULTS: Twenty-one subjects (M:F=13:8, ages 15.2+\/-8.8 years) were studied. Primary diagnoses included hypoplastic left ventricle in 9, forms of hypoplastic right ventricle in 10, and unbalanced atrio-ventricular canal in 2 patients. Time after Fontan completion was 11.4+\/-6.5 years. Current medications included aspirin (14 patients), coumadin (4), enalapril (8), lisinopril (10), digoxin (11), diuretics (5), and beta-blockers (5). Four subjects had pacemakers. All patients had a normal blood pressure and eGFR. Nine patients (43%) had a pathologic MCR (>20 microg\/mg). There were no significant differences between the MCR-normal and MCR-abnormal groups in age, gender, type of single ventricle, type of the procedure, age at or time since Fontan operation. The groups differed in post-Fontan pulmonary vascular resistance (PVR) (p<0.01) and strong positive correlations were found between the MCR and pre- and post-Fontan PVR (r=0.51, p<0.05 and r=0.61, p=0.02 respectively). The MCR-normal and MCR-abnormal groups did not differ in pacemaker, digoxin, diuretics, or anticoagulant use. However, the groups were different in using ACE inhibitors with a negative correlation (r=-0.45, p=0.04) between the MCR and lisinopril-equivalent ACE inhibitor dose. Moreover, no patient receiving a lisinopril-equivalent dose greater than 0.4 mg\/kg\/day had pathologic microalbuminuria. In conclusion, our study demonstrates that patients with Fontan circulation have high incidence of pathologic microalbuminuria, an indicator of renal injury. The use of ACE inhibitors may be beneficial in preserving their renal function.",

        "Abstract":"BACKGROUND AND PURPOSE: As life expectancy continues to increase, we will be faced with the need to counsel older patients on the risks and benefits of undergoing surgery. It is clear that laparoscopic renal surgery has significant benefits over open renal surgery. However, contemporary data on whether these benefits carry over to the elderly is less robust. The objective of this study is to compare the perioperative outcomes of laparoscopic nephrectomy in patients age 70 and over to those under age 70. Outcomes from the study can be used to assist in preoperative counseling for older patients.\nPATIENTS AND METHODS: Between February 2000 and December 2005, 405 consecutive patients underwent laparoscopic nephrectomy for benign or malignant conditions. To decrease selection bias, kidney donors, bilateral nephrectomies, partial nephrectomies, as well as patients under the age of 17 were excluded. Laparoscopic nephrectomies included simple nephrectomies, radical nephrectomies, and nephroureterectomies. A total of 158 patients were included in the analysis. Patient demographics and perioperative data were recorded prospectively. The preoperative American Society of Anesthesiologists (ASA) score was used to reflect patient co-morbidity. Subset analysis between pure laparoscopic nephrectomy (LN) and hand-assisted laparoscopic nephrectomy (HALN) was also performed.\nRESULTS: Average hospital stay for patients 70 years and older was 3.6 days versus 2.6 days for their younger counterparts (p = 0.02). All other demographic and perioperative parameters were comparable between groups, including incidence of intraoperative or postoperative complications, blood transfusions, and conversions to open surgery. In a subset analysis of patients undergoing HALN, despite having similar co-morbid conditions (ASA score 2.57 vs. 2.56, p = 0.9), the elderly group had a significantly increased length of stay compared to patients younger than 70 years (3.0 vs. 4.2 days, p < 0.05). However, in the group undergoing LN, there was no statistically significant difference in hospital stay (3.1 vs. 2.4 days, p = 0.22), despite the older group having higher co-morbid conditions (ASA score 2.55 vs. 2.10, p < 0.01).\nCONCLUSION: Other than an increased hospital stay by one day, patients 70 years and older undergoing laparoscopic nephrectomy can expect comparable perioperative outcomes to those achieved in younger patients. Such differences in the length of hospital stay may be mitigated by pure laparoscopic nephrectomy as opposed to hand-assisted laparoscopic nephrectomy in patients 70 years or older. These data may be useful in preoperative decision-making and counseling in this growing subset of patients.",

        "Abstract":"Celecoxib (Celebrex), the first cyclo-oxygenase (COX) 2-selective inhibitor (coxib) to be introduced into clinical practice, has been available for almost a decade. It is approved in one or more countries worldwide for the relief of the signs and symptoms of osteoarthritis (OA), rheumatoid arthritis (RA), juvenile rheumatoid arthritis (in patients aged > or =2 years) and ankylosing spondylitis (AS), the management of acute pain in adults, the treatment of primary dysmenorrhoea and the reduction in the number of adenomatous colorectal polyps in familial adenomatous polyposis. Celecoxib remains an effective and useful altenative to nonselective NSAIDs in the treatment of acute or chronic musculoskeletal pain. In the latter setting, it offers the prospect of improved gastrointestinal (GI) tolerability and, in patients not taking aspirin for cardioprophylaxis, a GI safety advantage. Currently available evidence of an increase in cardiovascular (CV) risk with celecoxib is inconsistent; any increase in risk is likely to be small and similar to that with nonselective NSAIDs. As with all NSAIDs, the potential GI, CV and renal risks of celecoxib must be weighed against the potential benefits in each individual; it is a rational choice for patients at low CV risk who require NSAID therapy, especially those at increased risk of NSAID-induced GI toxicity, but also those unresponsive to, or intolerant of, other NSAIDs. If selected, celecoxib, like all NSAIDs, should be used at the lowest effective dose for the shortest possible duration.",

The patients were divided into two groups: group I, in whom kidney biopsy was performed and followed by 1-day hospital admission; and group II, in whom renal biopsy was performed in the outpatient department and followed by 6 hours' observation period and then by regular outpatient visits. All biopsies were performed with the use of real-time ultrasound and automated biopsy needle. Patients with a history of a bleeding diathesis or abnormal coagulation profile and those receiving warfarin, heparin, aspirin, or nonsteroidal anti-inflammatory drugs were excluded from the study. Only minor biopsy-related complications such as gross hematuria, perinephric hematoma that resolved without the need for blood transfusion or surgical intervention occurred in three (13.6%) patients in group I and in two (9.1%) patients in group II. The complications were apparent within 6 hours in all but one patient (97.7%). Overall, hematuria was identified in 52% of patients at < or = 2 hours, 85% at < or = 4 hours, and 97.7% at < or =6 hours. The 24-hour hematocrit levels were not significantly different between the study groups. One (4.5%) patient from group II had a small perinephric hematoma, which was detected by ultrasound examination at 24 hours but not at 6 hours post biopsy period.; it resolved spontaneously without intervention. We conclude that in selected patients, same-day discharge after 6 hours of renal biopsy may be given safely without increased risk of complications.",

        "Abstract":"Dialysis provides effective and safe treatment of ESRD in children, but patients who are maintained on chronic dialysis are at risk for cardiovascular disease. One major risk factor for cardiovascular disease in adult patients with ESRD is chronic inflammation. The effect of anti-inflammatory therapy with aspirin on serum cytokine concentration was studied in seven children who were receiving hemodialysis (HD) and seven who were receiving continuous cycling peritoneal dialysis (CCPD or PD). Dialysis vintage was 4.3 +\/- 4.6 yr; single-pool Kt\/V was 1.46 +\/- 1.4, mean equilibrated Kt\/V was 1.27 +\/- 0.16, and PD weekly Kt\/V was 2.45 +\/- 0.30. Baseline proinflammatory cytokine IL-1beta, IL-6, IL-8, and TNF-alpha serum concentrations were significantly elevated, whereas serum anti-inflammatory cytokine IL-4 and IL-10 concentrations were normal. The patterns of cytokine elevation were similar for patients who were receiving HD versus PD. IL-4 and IL-6 concentrations demonstrated strong positive correlation with dialysis vintage (IL-4, P < 0.03; IL-6, P < 0.0001). Pre-aspirin serum cytokine concentrations did not vary with single-pool Kt\/V or equilibrated Kt\/V for HD patients or with weekly Kt\/V for PD patients. Serum IL-8 and TNF-alpha concentrations were significantly reduced by aspirin treatment at 4 mo (P = 0.04 and P = 0.007, respectively). Serum IL-6 concentration decreased with aspirin treatment but not significantly (P = 0.1). Serum IL-1beta concentration remained unchanged, and IL-4 and IL-10 concentrations remained stable throughout aspirin treatment. The effect of aspirin treatment on serum cytokine concentrations was similar for HD and PD patients. In HD patients, IL-6, IL-8, and TNF-alpha remained suppressed 1 mo after discontinuation of aspirin. It is concluded that proinflammatory cytokines are elevated in pediatric HD and PD patients without counterbalance from anti-inflammatory cytokines, and aspirin therapy attenuates inflammation.",

Bivalirudin, a thrombin-specific anticoagulant, overcomes many of the limitations of UFH and has consistently demonstrated comparable efficacy with significantly fewer bleeding complications. The purpose of this study was to compare procedural success in patients undergoing bare-metal stent implantation for atherosclerotic blockage of the renal, iliac, and femoral arteries and receiving either bivalirudin (0.75 mg\/kg bolus\/1.75 mg\/kg\/hr infusion) or UFH (50-70 U\/kg\/hr bolus) as the primary anticoagulant.\nMETHODS: This study was an open-label, nonrandomized retrospective registry with the primary endpoint of procedural success. Secondary endpoints included incidence of: death, myocardial infarction (MI), urgent revascularization, amputation, and major and minor bleeding.\nRESULTS: One hundred and five consecutive patients were enrolled (bivalirudin = 53; heparin = 52). Baseline demographics were comparable between groups. Patients were pretreated with clopidogrel (approx. 71%) and aspirin (approx. 79%). Procedural success was achieved in 97% and 96% of patients in the bivalirudin- and heparin-treated groups, respectively. Event rates were low and similar between groups.\nCONCLUSION: Bivalirudin maintained an equal rate of procedural success in this cohort without sacrificing patient safety.

Aims of this study were to detect EPO resistance in patients with DM and\/or CRF and to prove, that acetylsalicylic acid (ASA) is able to improve the haemopoietic status by decreasing neocytolysis.\nMETHODS: In a cross-sectional study, three groups of selected patients (patients with DM; patients with DM+CRF; patients with CRF without DM, n=15 each) and a group of controls (non-diabetic, nonazotemic subjects, n = 10) were compared. In the intervention part of the study, the effect of a single dose of 1 gram ASA on neocytolysis was investigated in a subgroup of these patients.\nRESULTS: Despite the similar EPO level (p = 1.000), all three patient groups had lower haemoglobin and haematocrit than control persons (p < 0.05 in all cases). Patients with DM+CRF had lower haemoglobin than patients with DM or CRF alone (p < 0.05). Single dose of ASA induced a fast increase in serum EPO level, a concomitant rise of the Rtc number and rate, red blood cell count, haematocrit and haemoglobin p < 0.01 for each). These changes were accompanied by a marked decrease in serum lactate dehydrogenase activity (p < 0.01).\nCONCLUSIONS: DM and CRF may induce erythropoietin resistance. In these patients, ASA treatment increases serum EPO level. The higher EPO level and the anti-inflammatory effect of ASA may decrease neocytolysis.",

It's usually well tolerated, but various side effects have been described. A 15-year-old female with ulcerative colitis developed polyuria, polydipsia, vomiting, and fatigue. She was receiving mesalazine (500 mg, thrice daily, p.o.) and prednisolone for 4 months. She was detected as acute tubular injury as she had dehydration, acidosis, hypostenuria, hematuria, proteinuria, low levels of potassium, uric acid and bicarbonate. These findings were attributed to interstitial nephritis as a side effect of mesalazine, however as renal biopsy was disapproved by the parents, it was not confirmed. After discontinuation of mesalazine her renal tubular functions improved. Potassium and phosphorus supplements were stopped after 7 months, although she had to continue bicarbonate supplementation. We conclude that regular renal screening is important in patients receiving 5-ASA therapy to prevent rare but serious complications, such as interstitial nephritis sometimes leading to chronic renal failure.",

The outcome measures were ICT (persistence, resolution, or embolization), effectiveness of therapy, and patient morbidity and mortality. There were 40 ICT diagnosed in 31 patients (22 males and 9 females). Mean age at diagnosis was 8.8 years (range, 15 days to 18 years). Overall mortality was 12\/31 patients (39%); only one death was attributed to ICT embolization. Embolic events occurred in 4\/31 patients (13%). The most common initial therapies included heparin infusion (n = 15), warfarin (n = 7), and aspirin (n = 7). The ICT resolved with medical therapy alone in 19\/30 patients (63%). One patient required surgical thrombectomy. The cohort was divided into group 1 (dilated cardiomyopathy), group 2 (status post Fontan operation), and group 3 (other diagnoses). In group 1 (n = 11), there were 8 deaths. Embolization occurred in 2\/5 large ICT, resulting in cerebral infarction and death (n = 1) and renal infarction (n = 1). The most common ICT location was the left ventricle (n = 10). Severe ventricular systolic dysfunction was present in 10\/11 patients (91%). In group 2 (n = 9), there was 1 death. Embolization occurred in 1\/7 large ICT, resulting in seizures and temporary paresis. All ICT were located in the Fontan pathway. Severe ventricular systolic dysfunction was present in 2\/9 patients (22%). In group 3 (n = 11), there were 3 deaths. Embolization occurred in 1\/9 small ICT, resulting in coronary emboli. ICT are most commonly diagnosed in pediatric patients with dilated cardiomyopathy or patients status post Fontan operation. The majority of ICT resolve with medical therapy. Larger ICT tend to embolize more frequently, and the morbidity secondary to embolization is significant. Rarely is mortality due to ICT embolization. The prognosis is poor for patients with left ventricular ICT or ICT in the presence of ventricular systolic dysfunction.",

        "Abstract":"Cerebral autosomal dominant arteriopathy with subcortical infarcts and leukoencephalopathy (CADASIL) is a hereditary systemic arteriopathy presenting with migraines, mood disorders, focal neurologic deficits, recurrent ischemic attacks and dementia in young adults. The genesis of this disease relates to missense mutation of the Notch3 gene. We report here a newly identified CADASIL patient and discuss unique vascular lesions observed in the kidney. A 64-year-old female was admitted to our hospital for the investigation of proteinuria, hematuria and progressive neurological abnormalities. Her mother and brother died of cerebral infarction at a relatively young age despite a lack of apparent risk factors for arteriosclerosis. Over the past 4 months before admission, she had suffered from frequent transient ischemic attacks despite appropriate antiplatelet therapy. Blood examination revealed mild renal insufficiency and urinalysis revealed moderate protein excretion and dysmorphic hematuria. Magnetic resonance imaging of the brain revealed multiple infarcts and leukoencephalopathy. Histopathological analysis of the kidney revealed focal segmental mesangial proliferation, the loss and degeneration of arterial medial smooth muscle cells and arterial intimal thickening. Immunofluorescence analysis of glomeruli revealed IgA deposition in the mesangial area. Electron microscope analysis revealed electron-dense deposition also in the mesangial area. In addition, granular osmophilic material (GOM) was observed in the extraglomerular mesangial area and around the vascular smooth muscle cells. Genetic analysis of Notch3 revealed an R141C missense mutation and she was diagnosed with CADASIL complicated with IgA nephropathy. In immunohistological analysis, Notch3 stains were positive in vascular smooth muscle cells of the interlobular arteries and both afferent and efferent arterioles, and weak in the glomerular mesangial area. Antihypertensive treatment using angiotensin II receptor blocker and a low protein diet were initiated, and her urinary protein excretion decreased to 0.2 g\/day. However, due to the progression of her neurological abnormalities, she became socially withdrawn. In CADASIL, GOM, abnormal accumulation of Notch3 ectodomain, is thought to induce the degeneration and loss of vascular smooth muscle cells and subsequent intimal thickening. Analysis of our cases provided that these morphological abnormalities were also observed in the CADASIL patient kidney.",

        "Abstract":"Nonsteroidal antiinflammatory drugs (NSAIDs) are drugs commonly prescribed in dental practice for the management of pain and swelling. Of these substances, paracetamol and ibuprofen are the most widely used. Their mechanism of action is based on the inhibition of cyclooxygenase, and therefore of prostaglandin synthesis. All of these drugs present a similar mechanism of action, as a result of which their side effects are also similar. The most frequent range from mild (e.g., nausea or vomiting) to serious gastric problems (such as gastric bleeding or perforation). Other side effects include an increased risk of vascular accidents (particularly acute myocardial infarction), renal toxicity secondary to a decrease in perfusion, and the risk of abnormal bleeding tendency due to the antiplatelet effect of these drugs. Their use is contraindicated in the third trimester of pregnancy, due to the induction of premature ductus arteriosus closure. The present study reviews the information currently available on NSAIDs, with special emphasis on those aspects related to dental practice.",

        "Published":"2006-12-11",
        "Abstract":"This paper presents the hypothesis, that pain and functional disturbances of organs which lie on the midline of the body might be caused by a venous congestion of these organs. Cause of their congestion is the participation of these organs (vertebral column, skull, brain, spinal medullary, uterus, prostate, left ovary\/testis, urinary bladder rectum, vagina, urethra) in the collateral circulation of the left renal vein. In many patients with complaints of the above mentioned organs the left renal vein is compressed inside the fork formed by the superior mesenteric artery and the aorta. This so called nutcracker phenomenon is incompletely understood today. It can lead to a marked reduction of left renal perfusion and forces the left renal blood to bypass the venous compression site via abundant collaterals. These collaterals are often not sufficient. Their walls become stretched and distorted - varices with inflamed walls are formed. These dilated veins are painful, interfere with the normal organ's function and demand more space than usual. This way pain in the midline organs and functional derangement of the midline organs can occur. The term \"midline congestion syndrome\" seems appropriate to reflect the comprehensive nature of this frequent disorder. The rationale for this hypothesis is based on the novel PixelFlux-technique (www.chameleon-software.de) of renal tissue perfusion measurement. With this method a relevant decline of left renal cortical perfusion was measured in 16 affected patients before therapy (left\/right ratio: 0.79). After a treatment with acetylsalicylic acid in doses from 15 to 200mg\/d within 14-200 days a complete relief of so far long lasting therapy-resistant midline organ symptoms was achieved. Simultaneously the left\/right renal perfusion ratio increased significantly to 1.24 (p=0.021). This improvement of left renal perfusion can be explained by a better drainage of collateral veins, diminution of their wall distension, thereby decline of their intramural inflammation, reduction of their mass effects (especially by the replaced spinal fluid inside the spinal canal and the skull), and altogether a reduction of pain and functional derangement in the affected midline organs. The proposed theory might influence the current understanding of such frequent and difficult to treat diseases as chronic back pain, headaches, frequent cystitis, enuresis, abdominal pain, flank pain and might spur new theories of arterial hypertension, placental insufficiency, prostate diseases and myelopathies.",

        "Published":null,
        "Abstract":"The administration of ibuprofen or any other nonselective cyclooxygenase (COX) inhibitor drug in early neonatal life is associated with a reduction of glomerular filtration, which reduces the elimination of drugs dependent on renal function for clearance. However, the relationship between COX inhibitor drug indication (prophylactic or therapeutic) and the magnitude of this effect remains unclear. Observations collected in two population pharmacokinetic studies, in preterm neonates, investigating amikacin and vancomycin were used to estimate: i) the impact of ibuprofen administration on the clearance of these drugs; and ii) the difference between prophylactic and therapeutic administration of ibuprofen on this clearance. Prophylactic administration of ibuprofen to preterm neonates on the first day of life to enhance closure of an asymptomatic patent ductus arteriosus (PDA) reduced amikacin clearance by 21% while coadministration of ibuprofen to induce closure of a symptomatic PDA resulted in an 18% reduction in vancomycin clearance in the first month of postnatal life. A significant and clinically relevant reduction in drug clearance is observed when ibuprofen is coadministered independent of indication, postmenstrual or postnatal age. Population modeling with covariate analyses can provide us with the tools to further disentangle the impact of nonselective COX-inhibitors on renal drug clearance.",

Patients with infectious colitis, amoebiasis, or cardiac, renal or hepatic failure were excluded, as well as those who had received corticosteroid or immunosuppressant treatment within the last month. Following a quasi-randomization principle, patients were allocated alternatively into the treatment group with rosiglitazone 4 mg\/d plus 5-aminosalicylic acid (5-ASA) 2 g\/d or sulfasalazine 3 g\/d and the control group with 5-ASA or sulfasalazine alone for 4 weeks. Clinical and histological changes were evaluated weekly by the Mayo scoring system for assessment of the activity of ulcerative colitis and the Truelove-Richards' grading system, respectively. PPARgamma and nuclear factor (NF)-kappaB p65 expressions in colonic mucosa were investigated before and after the treatment.\nRESULTS: Mayo scores decreased 4.01 in treatment group and 3.48 in control group respectively, with a remission rate 71.4% in treatment group and 57.1% in control group respectively. Along with the improvement of the Mayo score, the histological grade improvement was more significant in treatment group than in control group (P < 0.05). PPARgamma expression was higher, and NF-kappaB p65 positive rate was lower in treatment group than in control group after the treatment, and there was a good negative correlation between PPARgamma and NF-kappaB.\nCONCLUSIONS: Combined treatment with rosiglitazone and 5-ASA achieved better therapeutic effect than 5-ASA alone without any side effects. The PPARgamma expression was lower in active ulcerative colitis. Rosiglitazone alleviate colonic inflammation probably the through blockade of NF-kappaB, which can be a novel approach to the ulcerative colitis treatment.",

        "Abstract":"BACKGROUND: Renal side effects of nonsteroidal anti-inflammatory drugs (NSAIDs) are acute renal failure due to an impaired perfusion caused by inhibition of prostaglandin synthesis, acute allergic interstitial nephritis as well as acute toxic tubular necrosis. Moreover, chronic renal failure may occur due to a chronic interstitial nephritis or an analgesic nephropathy that is characterized by capillary sclerosis and papillary necrosis in addition to chronic interstitial nephritis. In contrast to acute renal insufficiency that may already occur after a single NSAID dose, analgesic nephropathy is a disease caused by long-term intake of NSAID compound analgesics and predominantly affects the middle and old age.\nCASE REPORT: An 18-year-old patient with a 4-year history of NSAID compound analgesic intake presented to the urology department with right-sided flank pain and increased serum creatinine. An obstruction as well as nephrolithiasis were ruled out and the patient was referred to the medical department. Urinalysis showed leukocyturia, mild microhematuria as well as proteinuria of 2.2 g\/day whereupon a diagnostic kidney biopsy was performed. Histology revealed a chronic nonpurulent destructive interstitial nephritis. After cessation of analgesic intake, the serum creatinine level fell to the normal range; however, a reduced creatinine clearance persisted indicating chronic renal damage.\nCONCLUSION: The present case is remarkable in that chronic renal damage due to intake of a compound analgesic was already observed in an 18-year-old patient. In this context, the permission of NSAID compound analgesics and their free over-the-counter sale to adolescents need to be critically questioned.",

Data concerning the cause of these lesions is rare and inconsistent, the occurrence may be part of the disease itself or a side effect of 5-aminosalicylates (5-ASA).

Twelve patients had tubular proteinuria previous to treatment. By the end of the study, urine specimens normalized in six, in further six the proteinuria remained unaltered, two patients developed proteinuria under treatment. In 14 patients, proteinuria was not detectable at any time. Eosinophiluria was found in none of the specimens.\nCONCLUSION: Under treatment with 5-ASA no toxic or allergic nephropathy developed. One initially pathologic urine specimen normalized under treatment coming along with remission of the intestinal symptoms and histological findings. This indicates an association between the activity of the ulcerative colitis and might be caused by renal excretion of pro-inflammatory cytokines.",

        "Abstract":"BACKGROUND: According to the data from the North American Pediatric Renal Transplant Cooperative Study (NAPRTCS), vascular thrombosis accounts for 11.6% of graft losses in pediatric renal transplantation. In adults, inherited and acquired thrombophilic risk factors, e.g. factor V Leiden mutation, have been associated with early graft loss and increased rejection episodes. Data on the impact of these factors on the outcome of children after renal transplantation are rare.\nMETHODS\/PATIENTS: Sixty-six pediatric patients awaiting renal transplantation (mean age 10.1 yr) were screened for inherited and acquired risk factors for hypercoagulable disorders (protein C, S, and antithrombin III deficiency, antiphospholipid antibodies, factor V Leiden, prothrombin, and MTHFR mutation) in order to intensify anticoagulation in those with an increased risk for thrombophilia: intravenous heparin was administered with a partial prothrombin time (PTT) prolongation of 50 s for 14 days and switched to low-molecular-weight heparin for another 8 wk before aspirin was introduced for the first year. Patients without hypercoagulable risk factors were treated with heparin without PTT prolongation for 14 days and switched to aspirin immediately afterwards. The results on graft survival, incidence of acute rejection episodes, and long-term renal graft function were analyzed between recipients with and without hypercoagulable risk factors.\nRESULTS: Thrombophilic risk factors were identified in 27.3% of our patients. No thrombosis occurred. One serious bleeding complication led to a second surgical intervention. The rate of acute rejection episodes was not increased in patients with and without thrombotic risk factors after 90 days (16.7 vs. 25%), 1 yr (22.2 vs. 33.3%), and 3 yr (38.9 vs. 41.7%) of follow-up, respectively (p = n.s.). After a mean follow-up of 3 yr the kidney function was comparable in both groups, with 63.1 in recipients with and 69.8 mL\/min\/1.73 m(2) in recipients without hypercoagulable risk (p = n.s.). At latest follow-up, three graft losses were found not to be attributed to thrombotic risk factors.\nINTERPRETATION: Children with thrombophilic risk factors were identified and treated with an intensified anticoagulation regimen after renal transplantation. An increased risk for graft failure, acute rejection episodes, or impaired renal function for pediatric renal transplant recipients with hypercoagulable status was not found.",

        "Abstract":"Because of the adverse effects associated with aspirin, especially Reye's syndrome in children, practitioners currently use as first line therapy drugs such as ibuprofen or acetaminophen. Their pharmacokinetic characteristics are not quite identical: both are absorbed rapidly and have high bioavailability, however, unlike acetaminophen, ibuprofen is characterized by high plasma protein binding and a limited distribution volume. Both drugs are metabolized essentially in the liver into inactive hydroxylated or glucoronidated metabolites by conjugation but acetaminophen is also transformed into an oxidation compound--normally reduced by glutathione--which, in the case of acute overdosing with depletion of endogenous glutathione stores, may lead to severe hepatotoxicity. Old age and light to moderate renal or hepatic failure do not significantly modify their pharmacokinetic parameters, and thus do not call for dose adjustment. Clinical trials have shown both drugs to have comparable efficacy on pain and fever, with perhaps a slight advantage for ibuprofen. In practice, the choice will depend on the prescription habits of the practitioner, patient's (or parents') preferences and, above all, the pathological context and possible contra-indications.",

SCs were classified into four groups: (i) vascular (12%, thrombosis or stenosis); (ii) haemorrhagic (12%); (iii) ureteral (7.5%, leaks and stenosis) and (iv) wound (16%, lymphocoeles or dehiscences).\nRESULTS: One or more SCs occurred in 299 (34%) patients, with multiple SCs in 65 (7.4%). By logistic regression analysis, recipient vessel atherosclerosis and delayed graft function (DGF) were significantly associated with both thrombotic complications [odds ratio (OR) 4, 95% confidence interval (CI), 1.4-11, P = 0.010 and OR 3.8, 1.3-12, P < 0.00001, respectively] and graft artery stenosis (OR 2.9, 1.2-6.8, P = 0.015 and OR 5.6, 2.3-13.4, P < 0.0001, respectively). Acute rejection increased the risk of graft artery or ureteral stenosis by 2.5 (CI 1.02-6.4, P = 0.045) and 3.3 (CI 1.1-10, P = 0.034), respectively. Older recipients were related to urinary leak (OR 1.04, CI 1.01-1.07, P = 0.011).

Increased age was the only independent correlate of bleeding events. Among patients with reduced creatinine clearance (CrCl), lack of adjustment of the maintenance infusion for CrCl < or =50 ml\/min occurred frequently (15 of 33 patients, or 45%) and was associated with a high rate of bleeding (20%). The association of CrCl with bleeding appeared to be largely mediated by the incorporation of age in the estimation of CrCl.

Compared to younger patients, those > or = 70 years old showed more frequently (p < 0.001) renal insufficiency (10.4 vs 4.4%), peripheral vasculopathy (18 vs 6.9%), history of stroke (7.3 vs 3.3%) or previous surgical coronary revascularization (15 vs 7.5%) and multivessel disease (61 vs 49%). In patients aged > or = 70 years, acute coronary syndrome was the more frequent clinical indication for PCI (54 vs 49% in patients < 70 years, p = 0.05). Globally, stent use was 89% with no differences related to the patients' age. Drug-eluting stents were used in 21% of the procedures in elderly patients and in 22% in younger patients. Use of glycoprotein IIb\/IIIa receptor antagonists in acute coronary syndrome was not correlated with the patients' age; nevertheless in elderly patients with acute myocardial infarction these drugs were less used during primary angioplasty compared to younger patients (48 vs 72%, p = 0.001).

        "Abstract":"AIM: To investigate whether microproteinuria in patients with inflammatory bowel disease (IBD) is associated with the disease activity or the treatment with 5-aminosalicylic acid (5-ASA).\nMETHODS: We prospectively studied microproteinuria in 86 consecutive patients with IBD, 61 with ulcerative colitis (UC) and 25 with Crohn's disease (CD), before as well as 2 and 6 months after their inclusion in the study. Forty-six patients received 5-ASA for a period of 28.8 months (range 1-168 mo). Microalbuminuria (mALB) and urine levels of the renal tubular proteins beta2-microglobulin (beta2mGLB) and beta-N-acetyl-D-glucosamidase (beta-NAG) as well as the creatinine clearance were determined in a 12-h overnight urine collection. Tumor necrosis factor-alpha (TNF-alpha) serum levels were also measured.\nRESULTS: A total of 277 measurements (194 in UC patients and 83 in CD patients) were performed. The prevalence of abnormal microproteinuria in UC and CD patients was 12.9% and 6.0% for mALB, 22.7% and 27.7% for beta2mGLB, and 11.3% and 8.4% for beta-NAG, respectively. mALB was not associated with IBD activity. Beta2mGLB and beta-NAG urine levels were correlated to UC activity (UCAI: P<0.01; UCEI: P<0.005). mALB in UC patients and beta-NAG urine levels in CD patients were related to TNF-alpha serum levels. An association was noticed between microproteinuria and smoking habit. Treatment with 5-ASA was not correlated to the severity of microproteinuria or to the changes of creatinine clearance.\nCONCLUSION: Microproteinuria is mainly associated with UC and its activity but not affected by 5-ASA.",

        "Abstract":"OBJECTIVE: There is currently no consensus concerning the age limit for the surgical management of kidney tumours and very limited data are available in the literature. The objective of this study was to evaluate the morbidity of renal cancer surgery in elderly patients in order to determine the benefit\/risk balance.\nMATERIAL AND METHODS: A retrospective study was conducted in 157 patients operated for kidney tumour in our department. Two groups were defined: one group of 40 patients over the age of 80 years and another group of 117 patients under the age of 80 years at the time of surgery. The following elements were compared in the 2 groups: presence or absence of symptoms, general state (evaluated by the Eastern Cooperative Oncology Group score), associated comorbidities (evaluated by the American Society of Anesthesiologists score), preoperative haemoglobin and serum creatinine, histological examination of the tumour, medical and surgical complication rate, postoperative mortality, length of hospital stay and specific survival.\nRESULTS: Tumour characteristics were identical in each group except for the presence of distant metastases which were more frequent in the group of patients young than 80. Older patients had a significantly higher preoperative serum creatinine (p = 0.01), a higher ASA score (p = 0.001), a higher medical complication rate (p < 0.00001) and a higher mortality (p = 0.04). At the end of follow-up, the specific survival was comparable in the two groups (32.5% versus 40%).\nCONCLUSION: Tumour characteristics and specific survival after surgical management of kidney tumours are comparable in elderly patients and younger patients. The risks of complications and impaired renal function were higher in elderly patients undergoing total nephrectomy. Close surveillance as well as minimally invasive alternatives will probably have an increasingly important place in the future, especially in patients presenting a major surgical risk.",

Patients who undergo percutaneous coronary intervention (PCI) are given multiple antiplatelet agents that increase that risk. We retrospectively tested the hypothesis that chronic kidney disease (CKD) patients who undergo PCI are at higher risk of bleeding and restenosis (due to chronic inflammation) compared to patients with normal renal function.\nMETHODS: Patients who had PCI for non-ST elevation myocardial infarction or unstable angina between July 2001 and June 2003 (1,184 patients) were included in the study. All the patients were given periprocedural clopidogrel, aspirin and glycoprotein IIb\/IIIa inhibitor if indicated, and then continued on clopidogrel and aspirin daily for 12 months. The patients were classified into 5 groups according to the CKD stage and followed-up for 12 months for development of major or minor bleeding, restenosis, length of hospital stay and survival.\nRESULTS: The incidence of major bleeding within the first month (3.4% in normal kidney function patients (Gp 1), 4.8% for CKD Stages 1 and 2 patients (Gp2), 5.2% for CKD Stage 3 patients (Gp3), 6.1% for CKD Stage 4 patients (Gp4) and 9.3% for CKD Stage 5 patients (Gp5), p = 0.001) and for minor bleeding (5.7% in Gp1, 6.5% for Gp2, 7.4% for Gp3, 9.2% for Gp4 and 11.3% for Gp5, p = 0.001) and the incidence of restenosis at one month (4.6% in Gp1, 5.3% for Gp2, 6.8% for Gp3, 7.3% for Gp4 and 9.6% for Gp5, p = 0.001) and 6 months (11.2% in Gp1, 13.5% for Gp2, 15.7% for Gp3, 16.4% for Gp4 and 19.7% for Gp5, p = 0.001) were higher with worsening CKD.

        "Published":null,
        "Abstract":"The diagnosis of hypertension by blood pressure measurements taken in the physician's office has been called into question by several studies. The onset of cardiovascular events appears to correlate better with ambulatory blood pressure measurements than with those taken during consultation (either \"white coat\" or masked hypertension). While the US, WHO, French and European guidelines diverge as to the specific antihypertensive drug among the seven classes available should be chosen for first-line treatment, there is a consensus for specific choices as a function of the type of hypertension. In any case, most treatment trials show that more than two antihypertensive drugs are often necessary. Treatment can thus begin with two drugs. The optimal target blood pressure is defined by the US JNC7 according to whether the patient also has diabetes or a nephropathy. When hypertension is uncomplicated, the target level is 140\/90 mmHg. In the case of diabetes or nephropathy, it is 130\/80 mmHg. In all cases, diet and exercise changes are also necessary and it is essential that patients understand them if they are to comply with them. Diastolic blood pressure remains the most important figure for those younger than 50 years, but afterwards, systolic pressure is more relevant. Aortic pressure may be more closely associated with cardiovascular risk than the blood pressure measured at the brachial artery. The concept of comprehensive management is radically modifying our behavior : the hypertensive patient is now above all a patient at high cardiovascular risk and the treatments to consider must not be limited to antihypertensive drugs but must also include treatment of other cardiovascular risk factors (aspirin, statins, smoking cessation, etc.).",

        "Published":"2005-10-18",
        "Abstract":"Premature coronary heart disease (CHD) has emerged as a major cause of morbidity and mortality in patients with systemic lupus erythematosus (SLE). Overall SLE patients have a 5-6-fold increased risk of CHD and this excess risk is especially pronounced in younger women where the excess risk may be >50-fold. Studies from our group and others have also demonstrated that SLE patients have a higher prevalence of subclinical atherosclerosis compared with controls, with approximately 30% having evidence of subclinical involvement. It is important to consider what factors may underlie this excess risk. We have found that certain 'classic' risk factors, i.e. hypertension and diabetes mellitus, are more prevalent in SLE and that persistent hypercholesterolaemia independently predicts patients who will develop CHD. These risk factors alone do not completely explain the excess risk observed, and after adjusting for classic risk factors SLE remains independently associated with both clinical and subclinical outcomes. Certain other metabolic changes also occur more frequently in SLE, namely premature menopause, renal impairment, high triglycerides and higher plasma homocysteine. In addition, insulin resistance is more pronounced in patients with SLE, and approximately 18% have the metabolic syndrome. It is also increasingly accepted that atherosclerosis is a chronic inflammatory condition, and in SLE systemic complement activation as well as immune complex formation can result in changes that promote the development of atheroma. Similarly, autoantibody production, especially antibodies directed against lipoprotein subtypes and those in the antiphospholipid (APLA) family, are gaining increasing attention. The role of the latter are particularly controversial as different subtypes have been shown to both promote and protect against atherogenesis. In a study looking at carotid plaque in SLE, we found that APLA was independently associated with the presence of plaque; this study also found that patients with plaque had higher white cell counts, suggesting ongoing chronic inflammation. We have also noted a negative correlation between activation of transforming growth factor beta-1 and carotid intima-medial thickness. This cytokine, which is known to be a potent anti-inflammatory molecule, has also been shown to be protective against atherogenesis. With regard to therapy, steroids may be a true double-edged sword, with low doses exerting a beneficial anti-inflammatory role whereas higher doses may be detrimental through exacerbation of metabolic risk factors. In contrast, we have found that antimalarials have a beneficial effect on lipids especially when co-prescribed with steroids, and this, along with anti-inflammatory and proposed antiplatelet effects, may confer protection against CHD in lupus. The risk of premature CHD in SLE is therefore mediated by a number of factors that involve not only classic risk factors but also a range of factors associated with SLE itself. Preventative strategies will therefore need to address all potential risk factors of relevance. A more through understanding of the interplay between autoimmunity and atherogenesis should be possible by the study of SLE, and this may not only benefit lupus patients but also may have implications for our understanding of atherosclerosis in general.",

These risk factors and Doppler screening can help target interventions such as aspirin and calcium that have been proven to reduce the incidence of pre-eclampsia in high risk women. Expectant management is the mainstay of treatment for pre-eclampsia. Hypertension should be controlled by oral or intravenous antihypertensive agents as necessary.

The high incidence of diabetes, chronic renal disease, platelet dysfunction, hypercoagulability, inflammation and a thrombus-rich environment make a GP IIb-IIIa and DTI combination with tirofiban (Aggrastat Merck and Company, Inc., Whitehouse Station, New Jersey) an attractive anticoagulation strategy in the PPI treatment of critical limb ischemia (CLI).\nMETHODS: Between May 1, 2001 and January 31, 2003, a CLI treatment group of 149 patients received PPI with bivalirudin (0.75 mg per kg bolus with 1.75 mg per kg per hour periprocedural infusion) and tirofiban (10 mcg per kg per minute bolus with 12-hour 0.1 mcg per kg per minute infusion) as an anticoagulation and antiplatelet strategy, and were compared to a matched unfractionated heparin (UFH) control group without GP IIb-IIIa inhibitors. Clinical and hemostasis outcomes were analyzed, including distal embolization (DE).\nRESULTS: Procedural success was 95.9% and 97.3% in the UFH control group and DTI-GP IIb-IIIa group, respectively. Significant differences were observed in the sheath removal time < 2 hours (60.5% UFH group versus 19.4% DTI-GP IIb-IIIa group; p = < 0.0001). Vascular closure devices were used equally in both groups. No statistical significance was observed in major and minor complications, femoral access complications, acute (< 48 hours) or subacute (30 days) vessel thrombosis, and 6-month duplex ultrasound restenosis rate between the DTI-GP IIb-IIIa versus the UFH group. A trend towards statistical significance was observed in the 6-month secondary re-intervention and limb salvage rates (10.7% versus 18.8%; p = 0.0501 and 93.9% versus 88.5%; p = 0.053) in the DTI-GP IIb-IIIa versus the UFH group, respectively. Angiographically relevant DE occurred in 4 of 149 (1.3%) and 8 of 149 (5.4%) of the bivalirudin-tirofiban and UFH groups, respectively.\nCONCLUSION: The combination of DTI with bivalirudin and GP IIb-IIIa inhibition with tirofiban is a safe and feasible alternative anticoagulation and antiplatelet strategy in PPI, and may offer improved clinical and hemostasis outcomes in treating CLI.

        "Abstract":"The nonsteroidal anti-inflammatory drugs (NSAIDs) cover a wide range of selectivity, from the nonselective cyclooxygenase (COX) inhibitors to the preferential COX-2, and the newest coxibs, selective COX-2, with 1000-fold selectivities for COX-2. Coxibs belong to the distinct classes of sulphonamides, methylsulphones, and phenylacetic acid derivatives. The affinity of an inhibitor for COX-1 and COX-2 determinates its relative selectivity. Minor changes in the amino acid structure between the 2 enzymes results in different forms of their active sites. However, the primitive hypothesis of a dualism between an isoform totally inducible (COX-2) and the other isoform constitutive (COX-1) was not completely true. Thus, also selective COX-2 inhibitors have been shown to interact with gastrointestinal, renal, and cardiovascular systems. New insights into pharmacological data and side effect profile of coxibs have been reported in this review. They may reduce gastrointestinal-related risks, but when administered with low-dose aspirin, they could create an ulcerogenic dual-COX inhibitor. Moreover, by inhibiting COX-2, they could delay ulcer healing. Similarly to traditional NSAIDs, coxibs compromise the glomerular filtration rate in patients at increased risk, and may cause peripheral oedema and hypertension. According to the traditional ''COX-2 hypothesis'', they should not impair efficacy of coagulation. However, in combination with an oral anticoagulant they increase the International Normalized Ratio (INR) and, in some cases, cause bleeding. The altered balance between prostacyclin and thromboxane, due to selective inhibition of COX-2 without reducing COX-1, could promote a prothrombotic state and explain the observed increased cardiovascular risk. Finally, the role of COX-2 expression in the ischemic preconditioning mechanism and the recent discovery of a pro-oxidant activity of sulphones has been analysed.",

Bleeding is the major complication of anticoagulant treatment, and the relative risks for bleeding vs stroke must be considered when starting anticoagulation.\nMETHODS: The AFFIRM trial included patients with AF and at least one risk factor for stroke, randomly assigning them to either a rate-control or rhythm-control strategy. All patients were initially treated with warfarin. The incidence of protocol-defined major and minor bleeding was documented during follow-up. Variables associated with bleeding were determined using a Cox proportional hazards model, using baseline and time-dependent covariates.\nRESULTS: The 4060 patients in the AFFIRM trial were followed for an average of 3.5 years. Major bleeding occurred in 260 patients, an annual incidence of approximately 2% per year, with no significant difference between the rate-control and rhythm-control groups. Increased age, heart failure, hepatic or renal disease, diabetes, first AF episode, warfarin use, and aspirin use were significantly associated with major bleeding. Minor bleeding was common in both treatment arms, with 738 patients reporting this problem in one or more visits.\nCONCLUSIONS: Bleeding is a significant problem that complicates management of patients with AF. Risk factors for bleeding can be identified, and knowledge of these risk factors can be used to plan therapy.",

Three areas of safety concerns are shared by both groups of drugs: Gastrointestinal complications (upper gastrointestinal bleeding, perforations or obstruction), cardiovascular safety (mainly myocardial infarction) and renal safety (acute renal failure, hypertension and electrolyte abnormalities). The incidence of renal complications may be increased two-fold with NSAIDs or coxibs, and there is no evidence for a major difference between the two groups of drugs. Coxibs are clearly associated with improved gastrointestinal safety compared to NSAIDs, but this benefit is reduced and may be lost completely with concurrent low-dose aspirin use. In contrast, coxibs may be associated with a greater incidence of cardiovascular complications, mainly myocardial infarction, especially in comparison to certain NSAIDs such as naproxen. Thus, coxibs are not generally safer than NSAIDs.

        "Abstract":"BACKGROUND: Although several randomized, control trials (RTC) suggest that oral anticoagulation (OAC) benefits patients with atrial fibrillation (AF), this might not be true for hospitalized patients with co-morbid conditions. If the results of the RTCs are valid, then how many patients in AF admitted to an acute medical unit will benefit from OAC? METHODS: An RCT-based decision analysis model calculated the quality-adjusted life expectancy (QALE) gain from OAC for 141 unselected consecutive patients over 65 years of age with AF admitted to an acute medical unit. RESULTS: If treated with aspirin, all 141 patients were predicted to gain QALE compared with placebo. If the quality of life adjustment (QoLA) on OAC was the same as placebo, then 104 patients were predicted to benefit from OAC compared with aspirin, while 63 patients were predicted to benefit at a QoLA of 0.99 (overall benefit 0.13+\/-0.15 QALYs, range 0.01-0.88 QALYs). These 63 patients were more likely to have had a stroke, diabetes, hypertension, heart failure or heart attack, and less likely to have impaired renal function than those predicted not to benefit. The 78 patients predicted not to benefit from OAC included 11 younger patients without heart failure, hypertension, diabetes or cerebrovascular disease; the remaining 67 patients, however, were older, more likely to have heart failure and\/or renal impairment and were at high risk of both stroke and bleeding. CONCLUSION: An RCT-based decision analysis model suggests that more than half the patients in AF admitted to a small rural hospital with acute medical conditions are unlikely to benefit from OAC, while all will benefit from aspirin.",

        "Abstract":"In this report we present a 28-year-old male patient with systemic lupus erythematosus (SLE) that was treated with immunoadsorption apheresis (IA) and cyclophosphamide for lupus nephritis (proliferative glomerulonephritis, class IV-B) after proving nonresponsive to drug therapy alone. Before starting the therapeutic cycle with IA, the patient was administered prednisone 25 mg\/d, hydroxychloroquine 200mg twice\/d, ACE inhibitors 5 mg\/d, aspirin 100 mg\/d, furosemide 50 mg\/d, and intravenous (IV) albumin (20%) 50 mL. Deteriorating clinical conditions necessitated a renal biopsy, and thereafter an increase in medication. The patient was given a bolus of IV cyclophosphamide 1 g\/d for 1 day and IV methylprednisone 500 mg\/d for 3 days. This was not followed by any improvement and the renal functions worsened. Thus, 3 weeks after the more aggressive pharmacologic treatment with cyclophosphamide, which had been prescribed to improve renal function, and given the young age of the patient, the decision was made to administer IA (Selesorb). IA selectively removes IgG and IgM immune complexes from the plasma, thereby reducing the complications induced by the pathogenic autoimmune reaction. The treatment was administrated twice a week for the first 15 days, once a week for a further 5 weeks, and biweekly in the last month with a bolus of cyclophosphamide (average 250-100 mg) after each session. After twelve sessions of IA over 3 months, renal function was completely restored and the patient discharged. Although it is not proven, the concomitant use of cyclophosphamide could presumably improve the final clinical outcome.",

The first and second renal biopsy findings and MRP8 and MRP14 expression on macrophages were investigated in both groups.\nRESULTS: Mean scores for positive glomerular and interstitial MRP8 and CD68 staining at the time of the first and second biopsies were significantly higher in group 2 than group 1. At the time of the second biopsy, mean scores for interstitial CD68-positive (CD68 +) staining were higher in group 2 than group 1. Mean scores for glomerular and interstitial MRP8 + and CD68 + staining at the time of the first biopsy correlated with the chronicity index at the time of second biopsy in both groups.\nCONCLUSION: Results suggest that MRP8 expression on macrophages in glomeruli and interstitial lesions at the first biopsy can be a useful prognostic marker for renal dysfunction in children with MPGN type 1.",

        "Abstract":"BACKGROUND: Patients with chronic kidney disease are at increased risk for cardiovascular disease, but the efficacy and safety of simvastatin and aspirin are unknown in this patient group.\nMETHODS: Patients were randomly assigned in a 2 x 2 factorial design to the administration of: (1) 20 mg of simvastatin daily versus matching placebo, and (2) 100 mg of modified-release aspirin daily versus matching placebo.\nRESULTS: Overall, 448 patients with chronic kidney disease were randomly assigned (242 predialysis patients with a creatinine level > or = 1.7 mg\/dL [> or =150 micromol\/L], 73 patients on dialysis therapy, and 133 patients with a functioning transplant). Compliance with study treatments was 80% at 12 months. Allocation to treatment with 100 mg of aspirin daily was not associated with an excess of major bleeds (aspirin, 4 of 225 patients [2%] versus placebo, 6 of 223 patients [3%]; P = not significant [NS]), although there was a 3-fold excess of minor bleeds (34 of 225 [15%] versus 12 of 223 patients [5%]; P = 0.001). Among those with predialysis renal failure or a functioning transplant at baseline, aspirin did not increase the number of patients who progressed to dialysis therapy (7 of 187 [4%] versus 6 of 188 patients [3%]; P = NS) or experienced a greater than 20% increase in creatinine level (63 of 187 patients [34%] versus 56 of 188 patients [30%]; P = NS). After 12 months of follow-up, allocation to 20 mg of simvastatin daily reduced nonfasting total cholesterol levels by 18% (simvastatin, 163 mg\/dL [4.22 mmol\/L] versus placebo, 196 mg\/dL [5.08 mmol\/L]; P < 0.0001), directly measured low-density lipoprotein cholesterol levels by 24% (89 mg\/dL [2.31 mmol\/L] versus 114 mg\/dL [2.96 mmol\/L]; P < 0.0001), and triglyceride levels by 13% (166 mg\/dL [1.87 mmol\/L] versus 186 mg\/dL [2.10 mmol\/L]; P < 0.01), but there was no significant effect on high-density lipoprotein cholesterol levels (2% increase; P = NS). Allocation to simvastatin therapy was not associated with excess risk for abnormal liver function test results or elevated creatine kinase levels.\nCONCLUSION: During a 1-year treatment period, simvastatin, 20 mg\/d, produced a sustained reduction of approximately one quarter in low-density lipoprotein cholesterol levels, with no evidence of toxicity, and aspirin, 100 mg\/d, did not substantially increase the risk for a major bleeding episode. Much larger trials are now needed to assess whether these treatments can prevent vascular events.",

        "Abstract":"The two cyclooxygenase isoforms (COX-1 and COX-2--coxibs) have overlapping functions and both are involved in the regulation of homeostatic and inflammatory processes in the various tissues. Treatment with highly selective COX-2 inhibitors is associated with significantly fewer serious adverse gastrointestinal events than is treatment with the dual inhibitors--the non-selective NSAIDs. Of the two coxibs, rofecoxib was shown to be much more selective than celecoxib and with less interaction with other drugs. Various clinical studies have demonstrated that the coxibs are equivalent, in anti-inflammatory, analgesic and antipyretic efficacy to comparator non-selective NSAIDs in osteoarthritis, rheumatoid arthritis, post surgery pain and dysmenorrhea. Perioperative use of coxibs reduces pain, opioid consumption and the risk of bleeding caused by the non-selective NSAIDs. The coxibs show similar tolerability for renal, liver and cardiothrombotic events as compared to the non-selective NSAIDs. Coxibs are contraindicated in pregnancy, in nursing mothers and pediatric patients and should be used with caution in patients with asthma. The impact of the coxibs on the cardiovascular system is controversial. However, coxibs should be used in caution and at the lowest recommended dose in patients with hypertension, ischemic heart disease and heart failure. These drugs do not interfere with the aspirin anti-platelet aggregation activity. Emerging evidence suggest that the coxibs may also find potential use as supportive therapy in various malignant tumors and intestinal polyps where COX-2 is overly expressed.",

        "Published":null,
        "Abstract":"The pathogenesis of preeclampsia stems from aberrant changes at the placental interface. The trophoblastic endovascular invasion of tonic spiral arteries that converts them to passive conduits falters. Uteroplacental insufficiency and fetoplacental hypoxemia result. Secondary maternal oxidative stress and an excessive inflammatory response to pregnancy generate the clinical syndrome of preeclampsia. Current treatment focuses on preventing seizures, controlling hypertension, preserving renal function and delivering the baby. We propose that the pathophysiological changes induced by preeclampsia in the placenta parallel those caused by persistent hypoxemia in the lungs at high altitude or with chronic obstructive pulmonary disease. Unrelenting pulmonary hypoxic vasoconstriction induces pulmonary hypertension and cor pulmonale. Inhalation of nitric oxide and phosphodiesterase-5 inhibitors opposes pulmonary hypoxic vasoconstriction, alleviates pulmonary hypertension and improves systemic oxygenation. Notably nitric oxide donor therapy also counters hypoxemic fetoplacental vasoconstriction, a biological response analogous to pulmonary hypoxic vasoconstriction. Fetal oxygenation and nutrition improve. Placental upstream resistance to umbilical arterial blood flow decreases. Fetal right ventricular impedance falls. Heart failure (cor placentale) is avoided. Emergency preterm delivery can be postponed. Other than low dose aspirin and antioxidants vitamins C and E no available therapy specifically targets the underlying disease profile. We hypothesize that, like nitric oxide donation, pharmacological inhibition of placental phosphodiesterase-5 will also protect the fetus but for a longer time. Biological availability of guanosine 3'5'-cyclic monophosphate is boosted due to slowed hydrolysis. Adenosine 3'5'-cyclic monphosphate levels increase in parallel. Cyclic nucleotide accumulation dilates intact tonic spiral arteries and counters hypoxemic fetoplacental vasoconstriction. Intervillous and intravillous perfusion pick up. Maternal to fetal placental circulatory matching improves. Enhanced placental oxygen uptake alleviates hypoxemic fetal stress. Appropriate fetal nutrition resumes. Cor placentale and severe intrauterine growth restriction are averted. Increased maternal cyclic nucleotide concentrations promote systemic vasodilatation so that blood pressures fall. Preemption of oxidative stress initiated by \"consumptive\" oxidation of nitric oxide stabilizes the vascular endothelium and corrects coagulopathy. Anti-inflammatory and immunosuppressant adenosine 3'5'-cyclic monphosphate offsets the extreme gestational inflammatory response. Cellular injury and multi-organ damage are prevented. One tablet a day of the new long acting phosphodiesterase-5 inhibitor, tadalafil (half life of 17.5 h) theoretically should allow a preterm pregnancy affected by preeclampsia to continue safely. Selective monitoring of vital organ functions guards against life-threatening maternal complications. Regular biophysical profiling warns the obstetrician of impending fetal compromise. Fetal growth and vital organ maturation can continue. As a result workloads imposed upon neonatal intensivists will lighten. Parental anxiety and concern will be allayed. The cost of treating preeclamptic mothers and their extremely low birth weight infants will decrease. Money saved by midwifery services in poorer states can be used to pay for better prenatal care. Severe preeclampsia\/eclampsia will be less common. Maternal and perinatal morbidity and mortality will be reduced. Because the human immunodeficiency virus often infects individuals at a workforce eligible age, the global acquired immunodeficiency syndrome pandemic has already brought many nations to the brink of economic ruin. Potentially productive lives saved for the future will help restore them fiscally.",

        "Published":null,
        "Abstract":"Nabumetone is a nonsteroidal anti-inflammatory prodrug, which exerts its pharmacological effects via the metabolite 6-methoxy-2-naphthylacetic acid (6-MNA). Nabumetone itself is non-acidic and, following absorption, it undergoes extensive first-pass metabolism to form the main circulating active metabolite (6-MNA) which is a much more potent inhibitor of preferentially cyclo-oxygenase (COX)-2. The three major metabolic pathways of nabumetone are O-demethylation, reduction of the ketone to an alcohol, and an oxidative cleavage of the side-chain occurs to yield acetic acid derivatives. Essentially no unchanged nabumetone and < 1% of the major 6-MNA metabolite are excreted unchanged in the urine from which 80% of the dose can be recovered and another 10% in faeces. Nabumetone is clinically used mainly for the management of patients with osteoarthritis (OA) or rheumatoid arthritis (RA) to reduce pain and inflammation. The clinical efficacy of nabumetone has also been evaluated in patients with ankylosing spondylitis, soft tissue injuries and juvenile RA. The optimum oral dosage of nabumetone for OA patients is 1 g once daily, which is well tolerated. The therapeutic response is superior to placebo and similar to nonselective COX inhibitors. In RA patients, nabumetone 1 g at bedtime is optimal, but an additional 0.5-1 g can be administered in the morning for patients with persistent symptoms. In RA, nabumetone has shown a comparable clinical efficacy to aspirin (acetylsalicylic acid), diclofenac, piroxicam, ibuprofen and naproxen. Clinical trials and a decade of worldwide safety data and long-term postmarketing surveillance studies show that nabumetone is generally well tolerated. The most frequent adverse effects are those commonly seen with COX inhibitors, which include diarrhoea, dyspepsia, headache, abdominal pain and nausea. In common with other COX inhibitors, nabumetone may increase the risk of GI perforations, ulcerations and bleedings (PUBs). However, several studies show a low incidence of PUBs, and on a par with the numbers reported from studies with COX-2 selective inhibitors and considerably lower than for nonselective COX inhibitors. This has been attributed mainly to the non-acidic chemical properties of nabumetone but also to its COX-1\/COX-2 inhibitor profile. Through its metabolite 6-MNA, nabumetone has a dose-related effect on platelet aggregation, but no effect on bleeding time in clinical studies. Furthermore, several short-term studies have shown little to no effect on renal function. Compared with COX-2 selective inhibitors, nabumetone exhibits similar anti-inflammatory and analgesic properties in patients with arthritis and there is no evidence of excess GI or other forms of complications to date.",

Parameters evaluated as possible risk factors for bleeding included age, renal function, weight, heparin and glycoprotein IIb\/IIIa inhibitor dosing and infusion duration, concomitant antiplatelet and\/or anticoagulant medications or disease states, and baseline hemoglobin, hematocrit, or platelet counts.\nRESULTS: Of 348 patients whose charts were reviewed, 79 patients were included. There were 37.9% who received abciximab (n = 30), 30.3% who received eptifibatide (n = 24), and 31.6% who received tirofiban (n = 25). Twenty-one bleeding events not related to coronary artery bypass grafting occurred: only 1 major bleed (tirofiban) and 20 minor bleeds.

Significant risk factors for bleeding included patient weight, infusion duration, and baseline platelet count (p = 0.024). Patients who bled received significantly more transfusions of packed red blood cells and platelets than patients with no bleeding (p = 0.047).\nCONCLUSIONS: Although bleeding complications did not differ significantly between the 3 drugs, several risk factors for bleeding events were identified.

The intrarenal hemodynamic study in all nephrotic patients revealed hemodynamic maladjustment characterized by preferential constriction at the efferent arteriole. Such constriction induced intraglomerular hypertension and exaggeratedly reduced peritubular capillary flow (PTCF). Following treatment with combined formula (group II), reductions in efferent arteriolar resistance and intraglomerular hydrostatic pressure were observed in conjunction with the increases in PTCF and glomerular filtration rate in all 18 patients.

In a nested case-control analysis, each case of renal disease was matched to 5 controls.\nRESULTS: Among the 19,025 5-ASA users with IBD, 130 patients developed renal disease (incidence rate of 0.17 cases per 100 patients per year). The incidence among patients with IBD but without 5-ASA use was 0.25 and among patients without IBD was 0.08. In the case-control analysis, the crude odds ratio (OR) for renal disease in current 5-ASA users was 1.60 (95% confidence interval [95% CI]: 1.14-2.26); the adjusted OR was 0.86 (95% CI: 0.53-1.41). For recent users, the crude OR was 4.18 (95% CI: 2.59-6.76) and adjusted OR 2.48 (95% CI: 1.33-4.61); for past users (last prescription more than 12 months before), 1.71 (95% CI: 1.09-2.70) and 0.99 (95% CI: 0.55-1.76), respectively.

In only a few records was renal disease attributed to interstitial nephritis or 5-ASA use.\nCONCLUSIONS: Users of 5-ASA have an increased risk of renal disease that may be partly attributable to the underlying disease. Although renal disease is a recognized adverse effect of 5-ASA, the incidence appears to be low and does not appear to be related to either the dose or type of 5-ASA used.",

Enoxaparin dosing practices, factors that might influence the safety of enoxaparin administration, and bleeding events were documented. Multivariable regression analysis was used to identify independent predictors of bleeding in this clinical setting.\nRESULTS: Of 208 patients with an ACS who received enoxaparin, 48 patients (23%) received a dose that was > 10% or < 10% of the recommended 1 mg\/kg dose, 18 patients (9%) did not have body weight documentation to guide enoxaparin dosing, and 17 patients (8%) had significant renal impairment (serum creatinine > 150 micromol\/L), with the potential for bioaccumulation of enoxaparin.

This is most apparent in kidney cancer, where laparoscopic radical nephrectomy is now considered to be a gold standard. Herein, we compared early postoperative morbidity in a contemporary series of open and laparoscopic radical nephrectomies. We reviewed all patients that underwent a radical nephrectomy between October 1999 and May 2001 at our institution. We then compared open radical nephrectomy patients to those undergoing laparoscopic approaches with specific attention to early complications. A total of 74 radical nephrectomies were performed: 41 open, 18 hand-assisted and 15 pure laparoscopic nephrectomies. Overall, complication rates between the open, hand-assist and pure laparoscopic groups were similar (10%, 17% and 12%, respectively, P = 0.133). There was no statistically significant difference in ASA score (P = 0.144), pre-operative hematocrit (P = 0.575) or intra-operative blood loss (P = 0.364). The open nephrectomy group had a statistically larger average tumor size (7.4 cm vs. 4.6 cm; P = 0.005) and younger average age (57 vs. 63; P = 0.019) than the laparoscopic group. Length of hospital stay was significantly shorter in the laparoscopic group (3.6 days vs. 1.7 days; P < 0.0001). Laparoscopic radical nephrectomy has an acceptably low complication rate and compares favorably to open radical nephrectomy. The low rate of complications combined with the advantages of laparoscopic surgery favor a laparoscopic approach for the majority of patients with stage T1 and T2 tumors.",

The ability of nonselective and selective COX inhibitors to prolong gestation has been used by obstetricians to inhibit premature delivery. The vascular effects of prostaglandin inhibitors can cause constriction of the fetal ductus arteriosus and reduce renal blood flow. These complications have been described for most nonselective COX inhibitors but are increasingly reported also for the selective COX-2 inhibitors. Aspirin, which causes irreversible inhibition of cyclooxygenases, differs from other NSAIDs with regard to indication, effects and side effects. Prematurity, which is increased in pregnancies of women with connective tissue diseases, is an additional risk factor for adverse effects of antenatal exposure to NSAIDs. Therefore, treatment with COX inhibitors should be discontinued at week 32 of gestation. The ability of NSAIDs to compromise reproductive function by inhibition of ovulation and as causative agents for miscarriage is still under debate. Glucocorticosteroids given in early pregnancy are a risk factor for the development of oral clefts. Therefore, the daily dose should be kept to <or= 15 mg during the first trimester. High doses of glucocorticosteroids in the second and third trimester are reserved for flares of autoimmune diseases. Intrauterine fetal growth restriction and premature delivery are possible side effects of high doses.",

        "Abstract":"Despite the fact that in recent decades many advances have been made in classification, outcomes measurements and therapeutic regimens, connective tissue diseases remain a challenge for paediatric rheumatologists. Corticosteroids are still the first choice therapy in juvenile systemic lupus erythematosus (SLE); however, it is time for a new therapeutic approach with immunosuppressant drugs in order to obtain a more prolonged survival and reduced organ system damage. A prevention of relapse of thromboembolic phenomena using low-dose aspirin is strongly suggested in children with anticardiolipin antibodies, particularly in those with SLE. The long-term prognosis in juvenile dermatomyositis is significantly improved due to a more aggressive treatment with corticosteroids and methotrexate. The treatment of Henoch-Schöenlein purpura is still under debate, and no agreement has been reached regarding the role of corticosteroids in the prevention of renal involvement. The management of the acute phase of Kawasaki disease is now well established, although there is controversy regarding the role of corticosteroids. It is still under debate how and whether to treat patients who do not fulfil the diagnostic criteria. Polyarteritis nodosa is a disease at risk of death and requires an aggressive approach with corticosteroids and immunosuppressants, while cutaneous polyarteritis needs a close control of an underlying streptococcus infection and prophylaxis with benzatin-penicillin to prevent relapses.",

        "Abstract":"BACKGROUND: Renal anomalies occur in about three infants per 1000 live births and have been associated with several environmental risk factors. Researchers have yet to assess the effect of maternal febrile illnesses on renal anomalies, even though febrile illnesses have been associated with other birth defects. Our objective was to determine whether maternal illness, fever, or medication use during the first trimester of pregnancy is associated with the occurrence of renal anomalies.\nMETHODS: In this population-based case-control study, we evaluated 192 infants with renal anomalies (renal agenesis [n = 44], obstructive defects [n = 134], and renal duplication defects [n = 14]) and 3029 infant without birth defects, all of whom were born in metropolitan Atlanta, Georgia, from 1968 through 1980. Maternal illness was defined as reported flu-like illness and\/or episodic illness during the first trimester.\nRESULTS: Our adjusted multivariate analyses showed that among the 192 case-infants, 38 had mothers with an illness (adjusted odds ratio [AOR], 1.71; 95% confidence interval [CI], 1.15-2.52), 20 had mothers who reported a fever (AOR, 1.80; 95% CI, 1.07-3.02) and 26 had mothers who reported taking medication (AOR, 1.69; 95% CI, 1.07-2.68). Fifteen mothers reported a fever and medication use (AOR, 1.90; 95% CI, 1.05-3.45). Nonprescription aspirin-containing medication use showed the strongest association (AOR, 3.45; 95% CI, 1.36-8.75) with renal anomalies.\nCONCLUSIONS: Our data suggest that maternal exposure to illness, fever, and medication (particularly aspirin) may increase the risk of congenital renal anomalies.",

We report here a comparison of antiproteinuric effects in two patient groups treated with different combination therapies.\nMETHODS: Group A comprised 12 patients with IgA nephropathy, who had 24-h proteinuria of 0.5 gm(2) or more, moderately severe renal histology, and normal renal function, and were treated with a combination of drugs, i.e., prednisolone, an immunosuppressant (mizoribine), an anti-platelet drug (dipyridamole), and an angiotensin-converting enzyme inhibitor. Group B consisted of 18 patients who had baseline characteristics similar to those of the patients in group A and were treated with our previous protocol (a combination of prednisolone, cyclophosphamide, and dipyridamole). Twenty-four-hour proteinuria and creatinine clearance were measured every 6 months. The primary endpoint was reduction of 24-h proteinuria by less than 25% compared with the baseline value.\nRESULTS: The proportion of patients that exhibited the primary endpoint, as assessed by the Kaplan-Meier method, was found to be significantly higher in group A than in group B (logrank test; P = 0.024). None of the patients in the two groups experienced serious adverse effects.\nCONCLUSIONS: The results suggested that the use of drugs in combination with cyclophosphamide was beneficial for patients with moderately severe IgA nephropathy.

        "Abstract":"BACKGROUND: The arthritis of rheumatic fever is very responsive to treatment with salicylates, but there are many adverse reactions, especially hepatotoxicity, due to aspirin (acetylsalicylic acid) therapy. These side-effects change the course and duration of rheumatic fever. Other non-steroidal anti-inflammatory drugs may be equally effective, although no reports are available.\nMETHODS: We studied 72 patients with rheumatic fever who were admitted to Dr Sami Ulus Children's Hospital between 1995 and 1999. Twenty patients with arthritis were treated with tolmetin (25 mg\/kg per day; group I) and 52 patients with arthritis and\/or mild carditis were put on aspirin therapy (75-100 mg\/kg per day) for 4-6 weeks (group II). Arthritis had disappeared at the same time in both the aspirin and tolmetin groups (P = 0.675).\nRESULTS: The erythrocyte sedimentation rates of patients upon admission, at the first week and at the end of therapy were not different in the two groups (P > 0.05). No adverse effect of tolmetin therapy was observed, whereas side-effects of salicylate were observed in 19 patients (36.5%) in the aspirin group. Hepatotoxicity, gastric irritation and salicylism were found in 16, four and three patients, respectively. Renal toxicity and Reye syndrome were not demonstrated. Because of these side-effects of aspirin, therapy had to be stopped for 10-20 days and the duration of hospitalization in this group was lengthened unnecessarily.\nCONCLUSION: Tolmetin was safe and effective treatment for arthritic rheumatic fever patients without carditis. Tolmetin can be used particularly in patients who cannot tolerate aspirin.",

Propofol was administered through the Diprifusor TCI system (Astra Zeneca) with the target concentration of propofol for induction set at 3 micrograms\/mL for group A patients and 2.5 micrograms\/mL for group B patients. Arterial blood samples were taken for analysis of drug concentrations at the following times: 2 and 5 minutes after starting the infusion; immediately after the incision; before and 5 minutes after increasing or decreasing the target concentration > 25%; before and 5 minutes after switching off the perfusion for surgery; upon eye opening; and 30 minutes after switching off the infusion pump. The predictive capability of the system was determined by performance error (PE). We calculated bias (%, median PE) and accuracy (%, median absolute PE).\nRESULTS: Twenty group A and 20 group B patients were studied. The median PEs in groups A and B, respectively, were -3.45 (-20.3-28.4) and -1.1 (-19.7-15.4).

However, the effects of anaesthetic agents on these responses have not previously been reported. This study compared the effects of sevoflurane and total intravenous anaesthesia using propofol and alfentanil on the haemodynamic and hormonal changes during percutaneous nephrolithotomy.\nMETHODS: Forty-two ASA I-II patients aged between 15 and 65 yr were studied. Sevoflurane in Group S (21 patients) or TIVA in Group TIVA (21) was used for the maintenance of anaesthesia. Haemodynamic variables and serum concentrations of sodium and potassium were measured before, during and after the procedure. Arterial blood-gas status, plasma renin, aldosterone and adrenocorticotrophic hormone concentrations were measured before and during the procedure.\nRESULTS: Mean heart rate was lower during percutaneous nephrolithotomy in Group TIVA compared with Group S (P < 0.01). The mean systolic and diastolic arterial pressures were not different in both groups at any stage of measurement (P < 0.05). Plasma renin, aldosterone and adrenocorticotrophic hormone concentrations were increased during percutaneous nephrolithotomy in both groups, but the increase was greater in Group S (P < 0.05).\nCONCLUSIONS: In the sevoflurane group, the concentrations of renin, aldosterone and adrenocorticotrophic hormone were significantly higher after 15 min of irrigation compared with the total intravenous anaesthesia group.

        "Abstract":"Outcomes in elderly patients with acute coronary syndromes are worse than in younger patients, and disappointingly, some therapies, such as thrombolysis for ST elevation myocardial infarction, appear to have less relative benefit than in younger patients. However, in unstable angina and non-ST elevation myocardial infarction, the elderly appear to derive greater relative and absolute benefit from the newer more potent antithrombotic therapies. With the glycoprotein IIb\/IIIa inhibitors, an equivalent relative benefit has been observed, which translated into a greater absolute benefit in older vs. younger patients. Similarly, when comparing clopidogrel plus aspirin to aspirin alone, there was a consistent 20% reduction in cardiovascular death, myocardial infarction, or stroke in both elderly and younger patients. An emerging area of focus, however, is that of the appropriate dose in the elderly. Because the elderly on average have worse renal function, many drugs will not be cleared as well, and thus higher plasma levels will exist, which can translate into higher bleeding complications. Future studies are evaluating downward dose-adjustment of new therapies in the elderly as a means of improving the efficacy\/safety profile. Thus, in unstable angina and non-ST elevation myocardial infarction, elderly patients are at higher risk and appear to derive particular benefit from more aggressive antithrombotic and interventional therapies.",

        "Abstract":"BACKGROUND: Nimesulide has been widely used to treat fever in children. Due to reports of adverse drug reactions, discontinuation or modification of its use has been suggested.\nOBJECTIVE: To evaluate the safety of oral use of nimesulide in children.\nDESIGN: Systematic review of published randomized controlled trials.\nSEARCH STRATEGY: Electronic searches of databases (PubMed, Cochrane, Toxnet) for relevant trials upto January 2003 using specified key words. The studies were also identified by searching the references of available meta-analyses and review articles, and bibliography of pertinent references.\nINCLUSION CRITERIA: Randomized controlled trials in children (less than or equal to 18 years of age) comparing the use of oral nimesulide with placebo or other antipyretic, anti-inflammatory or analgesic agents.\nOUTCOME: The primary outcome variable included the commonly encountered adverse effects of nimesulide therapy, i.e., hypothermia, abdominal symptoms, gastrointestinal bleeding, and elevated liver enzymes.\nDATA COLLECTION AND ANALYSIS: One of the authors developed a questionnaire and independently extracted data on methods, type of participants, interventions and outcomes. The meta-analysis was conducted using pooled relative risk with 95% confidence intervals, with random effects model assumption.\nRESULTS: We identified 16 trials that fulfilled the inclusion criteria. These included 1254 subjects, with mean age between 22 -140 months. Nimesulide was primarily used for its antipyretic (10 trials) or anti-inflammatory and analgesic activity (4 trials). One study each evaluated the symptomatic improvement in ARI and bronchial asthma. The control group included administration of placebo (3 studies), paracetamol (9 studies), and ketoprofen, naproxen, mefanemic acid and aspirin in one study each. The pooled effect sizes of various adverse events as compared between nimesulide and different control groups were: hypothermia (RR: 1.055; 95% CI: 0.184 - 6.047; P = 0.952), abdominal symptoms (RR: 0.464; 95% CI: 0.264 - 0.816; P = 0.008), gastrointestinal bleeding (RR: 0.914; 95% CI: 0.236 - 3.543; P = 0.896), and asymptomatic liver enzyme elevation (RR: 2.678; 95% CI, 0.558-12.853; P = 0.218). Cutaneous and renal adverse effects were not seen in any of the included studies.\nCONCLUSION: Oral nimesulide is as safe or unsafe as other analgesics-antipyretics for short-term use (less than or equal to 10 d) in children. The drug is best avoided in known or suspected liver disease; caution is warranted while prescribing nimesulide concomitantly with other hepatotoxic drugs. There is limited data for drawing concrete inferences below the age of six months.",

        "Abstract":"There is evidence that aspirin--and apparently other NSAIDs--may be protective agents against cancer in the gastrointestinal tract. These effects are particularly well documented in the colon and rectum. Even considered in isolation, the observational data regarding colorectal neoplasia are quite strong, and the reality of a protective effect is buttressed by clinical trial data showing that aspirin prevents sporadic adenomas. Furthermore, the NSAIDs sulindac celecoxib have actually led to the regression of existing colorectal polyps in patients with FAP. Clearly, NSAIDs have the potential to suppress carcinogenesis in the large bowel. Observational data suggesting inverse associations of NSAIDs with cancers of the stomach and esophagus have emerged from several case-control studies and a few cohort analyses. In some studies the findings display features often associated with causal relationships, for example decreasing risks with increasing doses or duration of use. Nonetheless, the data currently do not support a secure conclusion that NSAIDs protect against these malignancies. The relevant data are not nearly as extensive as those for the colorectum, and case-control investigation of these upper gastrointestinal sites may be particularly delicate. It is conceivable that early symptoms of cancer (or of pre-invasive lesions) may have discouraged NSAID use in the cancer patients, creating the appearance of a protective association of the drugs with the risk of these malignancies. More extensive observational data particularly from cohort studies would be desirable to confirm the existing findings and clarify the doses and durations of use required for an effect. Clinical trial investigation might also be practical for pre-neoplastic endpoints, or--in carefully selected populations--perhaps with cancer as the focus. There are only relatively limited data available regarding the effect of NSAIDs on cancer of the pancreas. However, the studies that have investigated this malignancy have reported indications that NSAIDs may have a protective effect. The effects of NSAIDs on cancers outside the gastrointestinal tract are not clear. Some investigations suggest that NSAID use, particularly aspirin, is inversely associated with risk of cancers of the breast or ovary, but several well-done studies have not seen these associations, and the observations could have been due to bias or confounding. Findings regarding prostate cancer are similarly conflicting. The urinary tract is one organ system in which several studies have reported an increased cancer risk in association with NSAID use. Nonetheless, the effects remain unclear. There is only limited available information regarding carcinoma of the bladder, and no firm conclusions can be drawn at this point. More extensive data have been generated regarding the effect of NSAIDs--largely salicylates--on renal cell carcinoma or cancer or the renal pelvis and ureter. Although some studies have reported increased risks, there are also findings suggesting no association. It is particularly difficult for observational studies to ascertain with confidence the true effects of aspirin because of the suspected relationship of these cancers with use of phenacetin and perhaps acetaminophen. Further data--particularly from careful and large cohort studies--would be important to clarify these issues. As a body of research, the findings discussed here from epidemiological studies and clinical trials have begun to clarify the effect of NSAIDs on carcinogenesis in various organs in humans. There is clear potential for protective effects at several anatomic sites. Even for the colorectum, however, it is probably premature to now begin to use these drugs widely for cancer prevention. To reach that point, a weighing of the risks and benefits of the drugs needs to be made, together with a judgement regarding the benefits of alternative means of prevention. For colorectal cancer, for example, aspirin may provide only limited benefit over regular colonoscopy [95, 96]. Nonetheless, with the increased understanding of the clinical effects of NSAIDs on cancer, the development of effective chemoprevention with these drugs appears to be a real possibility.",

        "Abstract":"The use of NSAIDs has become routine for adults and children in the management of pain. NSAIDs (other than aspirin [acetylsalicylic acid]) are also enjoying greater popularity as antipyretics since the recognition of Reye's syndrome's putative association with aspirin. In neonates, NSAIDs have been used for many years in an attempt to pharmacologically close the ductus arteriosus. This review examines the various NSAIDs and their potential and real applications in the neonatal population. For completeness, acetaminophen (paracetamol), which has weak NSAID activity and is a widely used analgesic and antipyretic in this patient group, was also included. The prostaglandin system is important for healthy development, and conversely there are unique risks posed by pharmacologic interference with this system in the neonatal period. The prostanoid system in neonates has the capacity to modulate nociception, but comes at the expense of interfering with nearly every organ system. Physiologic effects of inhibition of prostaglandin synthesis applicable to neonates include disruption of the sleep cycle, increased risk of pulmonary hypertension, alterations in cerebral blood flow, decreased renal function, disrupted thermoregulation, and alterations in hemostasis balance, among others. Prostaglandins are also important for the normal development of the central nervous, cardiovascular, and renal systems, and there is evidence that the proper genesis of these systems may be adversely effected by NSAID exposure in utero and in the neonatal period. Gastrointestinal adverse effects have provided the impetus for the development and marketing of selective cyclo-oxygenase type 2 (COX-2) inhibitors. These agents' reputation for safety in adults may not be applicable to neonates. COX-2 is involved in the development of several organ systems, and its inhibition may induce a prothrombotic state. The advent of parenteral formulations of cyclo-oxygenase inhibitors, including COX-2-selective agents, increases the therapeutic flexibility of NSAIDs. However, objective data on the safety of these agents have not kept pace with their clinical availability.",

        "Abstract":"Childhood nephrotic syndrome is a rare condition with an incidence of 1-2 per 100000 children aged below 16 years. Untreated idiopathic nephrotic syndrome (INS) is associated with increased risks of life-threatening infection, thromboembolism, lipid abnormalities, and malnutrition. The aim of the management of INS in children is to induce and maintain complete remission with resolution of proteinuria and edema without serious adverse effects of therapy. The majority of children have corticosteroid sensitive idiopathic nephrotic syndrome (CSINS), and in these children, corticosteroid therapy is the mainstay of therapy to induce remission. Data from a meta-analysis of randomized controlled trials (RCTs) indicate that prolonged courses of corticosteroids (up to 7 months) given in the first episode of CSINS reduce the risk of relapse. Nevertheless, many children relapse, and are at risk of corticosteroid toxicity if frequent courses of corticosteroids are required. Data from RCTs supports the use of alkylating agents (cyclophosphamide, chlorambucil), cyclosporine, and levamisole in these children to achieve prolonged periods of remission. The specific management of corticosteroid-resistant idiopathic nephrotic syndrome (CRINS) is more difficult since few therapies are consistently effective, and data from RCTs are limited. In such children, cyclosporine, alkylating agents, and high dose intravenous methylprednisone may be used. In addition to specific therapies for INS, supportive therapies are commonly used to control edema (loop diuretics, aldosterone antagonists, albumin infusions, angiotensin-converting enzyme inhibitors), reduce the risk of infection (antibacterials, pneumococcal vaccination) and thromboembolism (aspirin [acetylsalicylic acid]), and to control hyperlipidemia (HMG-CoA reductase inhibitors), especially in children with CRINS.",

        "Abstract":"With the population over age 70 growing, treatment for head and neck cancer in the elderly has increased. We retrospectively evaluated their management and outcome. Subjects numbered 121--83 men and 38 women from 70 to 94 years old--initially treated at our hospital. We classified them into 2 groups by age--the aged at 70-79 years (55 men and 26 women) and the very old at 80 years and older (28 men and 12 women). We also evaluated a younger control group aged 50-59 years (37 men and 19 women). Primary tumor sites were the oral cavity (28.1%), larynx (28.1%), paranasal sinus (15.8%), and hypopharynx (9.9%). Preoperative geriatric disease was seen in 54% of controls, 74% of the aged, and 93% of the very old. Cardiovascular and respiratory diseases were most common. Surgical treatment and irradiation were essential for cancer treatment. Postoperative complications, including pneumonia, delirium, renal and cardiovascular hypofunction occurred in 56.5% of controls, 48.2% of the aged, and 47.8% of the very old. The frequency of postoperative complications correlated significantly with the American Society of Anesthesiologist classification of physical status (ASA) and preoperative performance status (PS). The complications of irradiation including pneumonia, dehydration, and feeding disturbance occurred in 53% of the very old. Cures were achieved in 83.9% of controls, 81.5% of the aged, and 65.0% of the very old. Cause specific 5-year survival in those cured was 85.2% of controls, 84.5% of the aged, and 80.0% of the very old. Median survival in those not cured was 4 months in controls, 9.6 months in the aged, and 5 months in the very old. We concluded that curative treatment is important in the elderly, and the success of curative treatment and the prevention of complications depend on careful assessment of systemic disease, PS, ASA, and mental activity.",

        "Abstract":"INTRODUCTION: Some necrotizing vasculitis may be associated with familial Mediterranean fever (FMF). We report a new case of polyarteritis nodosa (PAN) that preceded the diagnosis of FMF.\nOBSERVATION: A young woman of Turkish origin had a long childhood history of inflammatory arthralgia and myalgia, leading to the provisional diagnosis of chronic juvenile arthritis, then, after a confirmative muscle biopsy, to the diagnosis of PAN, whose outcome remained benign. At the age of 19, she was diagnosed as having FMF on clinical and genetic grounds, and colchicine led to the regression of most symptoms.\nDISCUSSION: As with Henoch-Schönlein's purpura, PAN seems significantly associated with FMF. Its characteristics are a younger age at onset, more frequent peri-renal hematoma, overlap between classical PAN and micropolyangeitis, and overall better prognosis. In its muscular form, PAN is difficult to distinguish from protracted febrile myalgia, a recently described manifestation of FMF, in which pathological findings are poorly documented.",

        "Published":null,
        "Abstract":"BACKGROUND: Low-dose treatment with acetylsalicylic acid (ASA) is widely recommended to type 2 diabetic patients as primary prevention against cardiovascular disease. High-dose treatment with cyclooxygenase inhibitors reduces urinary albumin excretion rate (AER) in type 1 diabetic patients with micro- or macroalbuminuria. Whether a similar effect on AER exists during low-dose ASA treatment, which may confound the diagnosis and monitoring of micro- and macroalbuminuria in type 2 diabetic patients, remains to be elucidated.\nMETHODS: In a randomized, double-blind, crossover trial, 31 type 2 diabetic patients with elevated levels of AER (>30 mg\/24 h) were, in random order, given ASA (150 mg\/day) for 4 weeks followed by placebo for 4 weeks with a 2 week washout period or vice versa. At the end of each treatment period AER, glomerular filtration rate (GFR), blood pressure (BP), transcapillary escape rate (TER(alb)) of albumin and haemoglobin A(1c) (HbA(1c)) were measured.\nRESULTS: The following variables remained unchanged (mean (95% CI) unless otherwise noted) (ASA vs placebo, paired Student's t-test): AER (201 (119-341) vs 205 (124-340) mg\/24 h (geometric mean, 95% CI); P=0.78), GFR (103 (94-111) vs 102 (93-110) ml\/min; P=0.58), systolic BP (151 (146-158) vs 152 (146-158) mmHg; P=0.68), diastolic BP (87 (83-91) vs 87 (82-91) mmHg; P=0.88), TER(alb) (6.3 (5.7-6.9) vs 5.9 (5.1-6.7); P=0.45) and HbA(1c) (8.6 (8.1-9.0) vs 8.5 (8.1-9.0) %; P=0.60).\nCONCLUSIONS: Low-dose treatment with 150 mg ASA daily does not have any impact on AER or GFR in type 2 diabetic patients with micro- or macroalbuminuria. Consequently, the widely recommended prescription of low-dose ASA as a primary and secondary prevention strategy against cardiovascular disease in these patients does not confound the diagnosis or monitoring of micro- or macroalbuminuria.",

        "Published":null,
        "Abstract":"BACKGROUND: Patients with transient ischaemic attacks (TIA) and minor ischaemic strokes are at risk of serious vascular events (death from all vascular causes, non-fatal stroke, or non-fatal myocardial infarction). Their risk of vascular events lies between 4 and 11 percent per year. Aspirin only, in a daily dose of 30 mg or more, offers only modest protection in such patients: it reduces the incidence of major vascular events by 13 percent. In a single trial, adding dipyridamole (an alternative antiplatelet agent) to aspirin was associated with a 22 percent reduction in the risk of major vascular events compared with aspirin alone. However, a systematic review of all trials of antiplatelet agents by the Antithrombotic Trialists' Collaboration showed that, in high risk patients, there was virtually no difference between the aspirin-dipyridamole combination and aspirin alone. We therefore sought to assess the effects of dipyridamole in more detail.\nOBJECTIVES: 1) To assess the efficacy of dipyridamole versus control in the secondary prevention of vascular events in patients with vascular disease in the presence and absence of other antiplatelet drugs. 2) To assess the safety of dipyridamole versus control in the secondary prevention of vascular events in patients with vascular disease in the presence and absence of other antiplatelet drugs.\nSEARCH STRATEGY: The Cochrane Stroke Group Trials Register was searched and other relevant Cochrane Groups were contacted to search their specialised registers (last search 29 April 2002). In addition the Cochrane Controlled Trials Register, MEDLINE and EMBASE were searched and Dutch manufacturers of dipyridamole were contacted to identify further published and unpublished studies.\nSELECTION CRITERIA: Randomised long term secondary prevention trials with concealed treatment allocation, treatment for > 1 month, starting within 6 months after presentation of a arterial vascular disease were selected (coronary artery disease, myocardial infarction, angina pectoris, retinopathy, nephropathy, peripheral arterial disease, stroke, TIA, amaurosis fugax). Therapy consisted of dipyridamole in any dose in the presence or absence of other antiplatelet drugs compared with no drug or an antiplatelet drug(s) other than dipyridamole (control group).\nDATA COLLECTION AND ANALYSIS: Two reviewers selected trials which met the inclusion criteria and extracted details of randomisation methods, blinding of treatments and assessments, whether intention-to-treat analysis was possible from the published data, whether treatment groups were comparable with regard to major prognostic factors, the number of patients who were excluded or lost to follow-up, definition of outcome events, and entry and exclusion criteria. The methodological quality of each trial was assessed by the two reviewers on the basis of these extracted data. In addition, dose and type of antiplatelet treatments, duration of follow-up and the numbers of defined outcome events were recorded. Data published by the Antithrombotic Trialists' Collaboration were used. The remaining data were independently extracted by the same two reviewers and cross checked. Data were analysed according to the intention-to-treat principle. Relative and absolute risk reductions were calculated by means of the statistical software provided by the Cochrane Collaboration (RevMan).\nMAIN RESULTS: Twenty-six trials were included, with a total of 19842 patients, among whom 1399 vascular deaths and 3085 fatal and non-fatal vascular events occurred during follow-up. Compared with control, dipyridamole had no clear effect on vascular death (RR 1.02, 95% CI 0.90 to 1.17). This result was not influenced by the dose of dipyridamole or type of presenting vascular disease. Compared with control, dipyridamole appeared to reduce the risk of vascular events (RR 0.90, 95% CI 0.83 to 0.98), but this effect was only statistically significant due to a single large trial in patients presenting with cerebral ischaemia (6602 patients). Comparing dipyridamole plus aspirin with aspirin alone: there was no clear difference in vascular death, the RR was 1.03 (95% CI 0.87 to 1.22); the combination was associated with fewer vascular events with an RR of 0.90 (95% CI 0.80 to 1.00). Combination treatment of dipyridamole and aspirin compared with placebo had an RR of 0.89 (95% CI 0.79 to 1.01) for vascular death and an RR of 0.74 (95% CI 0.68 to 0.80) for vascular events.\nREVIEWER'S CONCLUSIONS: This review found that, for patients who presented with arterial vascular disease, there was no evidence that dipyridamole, in the presence or absence of an other antiplatelet drug (chiefly aspirin) reduced the risk of vascular death, though it may reduce the risk of further vascular events. However, this benefit was found in only a single large trial and only in patients presenting after cerebral ischaemia. There was no evidence that dipyridamole alone was more efficacious than aspirin. Further trials comparing the effects of the combination of dipyridamole with aspirin with aspirin alone are justified.",

        "Published":null,
        "Abstract":"Pain is a common symptom after surgery in children, and the need for effective pain management is obvious. For example, after myringotomy, despite the brief nature of the procedure, at least one-half of children have significant pain. After more extended surgery, such as tonsillectomy, almost all children have considerable pain longer than 7 days. Nonsteroidal anti-inflammatory drugs (NSAIDs) are useful for postoperative pain management because surgery causes both pain and inflammation. Several pediatric studies indicate NSAIDs are effective analgesics in the management of mild and moderate pain. In the treatment of severe pain, NSAIDs should be given with acetaminophen (paracetamol) or opioids, and the use of an appropriate regional analgesic technique should be considered. NSAIDs are more effective in preventing pain than in the relief of established pain. Pain following surgery is best managed by providing medication on a regular basis, preventing the pain from recurring. This proactive approach should be implemented for any procedure where postoperative pain is the likely outcome. In children, the choice of formulation can be more important than the choice of drug. Intravenous administration is preferred for children with an intravenous line in place; thereafter mixtures and small tablets are feasible options. Children dislike suppositories, and intramuscular administration should not be used in nonsedated children. Ibuprofen, diclofenac, ketoprofen and ketorolac are the most extensively evaluated NSAIDs in children. Only a few trials have compared different NSAIDs, but no major differences in the analgesic action are expected when appropriate doses of each drug are used. Whether NSAIDs differ in the incidence and severity of adverse effects is open to discussion. Because NSAIDs prevent platelet aggregation they may increase bleeding. A few studies indicate that ketorolac may increase bleeding more so than other NSAIDs, but the evidence is conflicting. Severe adverse effects of NSAIDs in children are very rare, but it is important to know about adverse effects in order to recognize and treat them when they do occur. NSAIDs are contraindicated in patients in whom sensitivity reactions are precipitated by aspirin (acetylsalicylic acid) or other NSAIDs. They should be used with caution in children with liver dysfunction, impaired renal function, hypovolemia or hypotension, coagulation disorders, thrombocytopenia, or active bleeding from any cause. In contrast, it seems that most children with mild asthma may use NSAIDs.",

Platelet and renal formation of thromboxane A2 and the formation of prostaglandin E2 and prostacyclin were evaluated in vivo by quantification of index metabolites in plasma and urine by gas chromatography-mass spectrometry in neonates after maternal LDA (n = 14) and in a control group.\nRESULTS: In the pregnant women, acetylsalicylic acid and salicylic acid concentrations rapidly increased after ingestion of LDA. Acetylsalicylic acid was completely eliminated within 4 hours, whereas salicylic acid was detected with low concentrations at 18 and 21 hours after dosing. In the neonates, acetylsalicylic acid was not detected. Salicylic acid was detected in 1 infant only. Platelet thromboxane A2 formation in the newborn infants was significantly suppressed but recovered within 2 to 3 days after discontinuation of LDA. Renal thromboxane A2 formation and the formation of prostaglandin E2 and prostacyclin were not affected by LDA.\nCONCLUSION: In pregnant women who are treated with LDA, acetylsalicylic acid is not completely inactivated in the portal circulation but reaches the uteroplacental circulation and exerts antiplatelet effects in the fetus and newborn.",

They were chronologically divided into two groups: 41 patients (group A), using an older ultrasound machine; and 44 patients (group B), using a newer ultrasound machine. Nine patients biopsied with a manual 14G Tru-cut needle served as the control (group C).\nRESULTS: The number of \"attempted\" passes at the kidney was 4.0 +\/- 0.1 in group B, 4.7 +\/- 0.3 in group A (P < 0.05 vs. group B), and 5.8 +\/- 0.5 in group C (P < 0.01 vs. group B).

Nevertheless, they are widely used, in particular by the obstetricians. During pregnancy, the potential toxicity of these drugs is double, maternal and fetal. The maternal toxicity is comparable to that, already known in adults, with however, some particularities at the time of labor and delivery. The fetal toxicity is mainly renal and cardiovascular, with the NSAI responsible for oligoamniosis and premature closure of the arterial canal of the fetus. On the other hand, the use of these molecules during breast-feeding does not seem source of adverse events, notably in the newborn. THE VARIOUS MOLECULES: Among the family of non-selective non-steroidal anti-inflammatories, indications and adverse events of the various molecules differ considerably. Moreover, whereas the majority of these molecules are non-selective, i.e. inhibiting the two isoforms of cyclooxygenase, new therapeutics, specifically inhibiting cyclooxygenase-2, are now available. Few studies have been published concerning their prescription during pregnancy and breast-feeding and their maternal and fetal side effects remain ignored by most of the practitioners.",

        "Abstract":"The necessity of withdrawal of aspirin [acetylsalicylic acid (ASA)] for fear of perioperative or postoperative bleeding in patients about to undergo surgery is as yet controversial. In this study we prospectively evaluated the effect of ASA on postoperative bleeding in end-stage renal failure patients who underwent insertion, removal, and\/or replacement of a peritoneal dialysis (PD) catheter at our institution from November 1999 to March 2001. During the study period 52 of the above procedures were consecutively performed in 46 patients. Patients whose catheters were removed as a result of refractory peritonitis were excluded from the study. In all cases the PD catheter used was the coiled two-cuff Tenckhoff (NIPRO, Manchester, GA) catheter and the surgery was performed in the operating room under local anesthesia. No drains were left in the operating wound. Postoperative bleeding (wound hematoma or persistent oozing from the incision or exit site) was classified as either minor (requiring no professional intervention and\/or blood replacement) or major [necessitating blood transfusion (> or = 1 unit red blood cells). Of the 52 procedures 29 (in 24 patients) were performed while the patient was receiving aspirin at the time of operation (aspirin group). The remaining 23 were without aspirin and constituted the control group. ASA dose was 100 mg\/day in all but three who were on buffered ASA (325 mg\/day). The groups were well matched with regard to age; sex; mean residual renal function; and preoperative international normalized ratio, activated partial thromboplastin time, and platelet count. In no case was there significant intraoperative bleeding. There were five (17.2%) and three (13.0%) minor bleeds in the aspirin group and control group, respectively. One major bleed occurred in the control group ending in an exploratory laparotomy. Of the nine bleeding complications six were observed after catheter removal. From these data we conclude that PD catheter insertion\/removal can be safely performed under conventional low-dose aspirin therapy.",

This study investigates the effect of acetylsalicylic acid (ASA) combined with dipyridamole on proteinuria and renal function in nephrotic MPGN patients with normal\/moderately reduced glomerular filtration rate (GFR). Fourteen patients with biopsy-proven type I MPGN received ASA (1000 mg\/day) and dipyridamole (300 mg\/day) for 24 months. Proteinuria was reduced from 6.8 +\/- 2.4 g\/day to 1.1 +\/- 0.6 g\/day (p < 0.001). Serum albumin levels increased from 2.2 +\/- 0.5 g\/dL to 3.7 +\/- 0.4 g\/dL (p < 0.001) during the study period after 24 months compared to baseline. Serum creatinine and GFR did not significantly change in patients treated with acetylsaliclylic acid and dipyridamole during the observation period (p < 0.05). Our study suggests that ASA combined with dipyridamole significantly reduces proteinuria without impairing renal function in patients with MPGN.",

        "Abstract":"Pre-eclampsia has been shown to be associated with platelet activation and excessive release of vasoconstricting thromboxane preceding the onset of the disease. Low-dose acetylsalicylic acid (ASA) substantially inhibits thromboxane formation and may thus prevent pre-eclampsia from developing. In agreement with this hypothesis early randomised trials reported on promising reductions in pre-eclampsia risk and possible fetal growth retardation. Subsequent multicentre trials during the nineties failed to confirm a large benefit, which may in part be explained by late initiation of treatment, low dosages, low patient compliance and wide inclusion of women with concomitant disorders such as chronic hypertension, diabetes mellitus and kidney disease. A recent systematic review of all randomised trials showed an acceptable safety profile and a significant but only moderate reduction in the risk of pre-eclampsia regardless of gestation at trial entry or dose of ASA. There is now growing evidence that the earlier ASA treatment is started, the greater the reduction in the risk of pre-eclampsia is. Moreover, ASA has much stronger effects at higher (80 - 150 mg\/day) than at lower doses in the protection against pre-eclampsia and the prevention of severe fetal growth retardation. No clinically important effects, however, have been found in patients with chronic hypertension, kidney disease or diabetes mellitus. In contrast, low dose ASA (100 mg\/day) might benefit women with unfavourable obstetric history, in particular those with severe fetal growth retardation or pre-eclampsia with onset at < 32 weeks. The crucial time for starting treatment may be before 16 weeks and daily ingestion before bedtime appears useful. To start low-dose ASA at 20 - 24 weeks gestation seems only justified in women with abnormal uterine Doppler flow.",

        "Published":null,
        "Abstract":"Accumulated experimental and clinical data suggest that adrenocorticosteroids and\/or endogenous ouabain-like substances may play an important role in the mechanism of furosemide diuretic action. It was reported that the drug is highly bound in the adrenals, lungs, kidney, spleen, and liver. In patients with liver cirrhosis, furosemide exerted a markedly decreased natriuretic effect compared with normal subjects, and the plasma levels of circulating endothelin and atrial natriuretic factor (ANF) were significantly elevated. In neonates, after administration of furosemide, the urinary excretion of endothelin-1 and aldosterone increased markedly, and it is known that endothelin may release ANF and aldosterone in a dose-dependent manner. Furosemide was used to stimulate zona glomerulosa, whereas ANF decreased the production of steroids in zona glomerulosa and fasciculata cell culture owing to stimulation by various factors. Because the concomitant use of ANF and furosemide appeared to be diuretically effective in newborns after cardiac surgery, one may suggest that furosemide competes with ANF for its effects on the adrenals. Furosemide administered by inhalation exerted a protective effect on allergic and perennial nonallergic rhinitis and was effective in preventing the postsurgical recurrence of nasal polyposis. The drug can also be used as an antiasthmatic agent. In preterm ventilator-dependent infants with chronic lung disease, aerosolized furosemide improved pulmonary function with no marked effect on diuresis. In adults and children with asthma, furosemide exerted a protective effect against bronchoconstriction induced by several indirect stimuli similar to that of disodium cromoglycate or nedocromil. Aerosolized furosemide had a preventive effect also on bronchoconstriction induced by inhaled lysine acetylsalicylate in patients with aspirin-sensitive asthma. In high-dose beclomethasone-dependent asthma, inhaled lysine acetylsalicylate and furosemide exerted a mutually potentiating antiasthmatic activity, allowing considerable sparing of the inhaled steroid. It is proposed that this effect may be explained by the corticosteroid-sparing action of lysine released from the lysine acetylsalicylate molecule because similar beneficial effects were also obtained after the concomitant use of epsilon-aminocaproic acid (whose chemical structure is almost the same as that of lysine) and prednisone. Furosemide exhibited an anti-inflammatory effect through inhibition of production and release of cytokines interleukin (IL)-6, IL-8, and tumor necrosis factor-alpha from peripheral mononuclear cells, which may have a beneficial effect on local inflamed tissue imbalance in the ratio of different cytokines, thus improving the sensitivity of target cells to endogenous glucocorticosteroids.",

        "Abstract":"The aim of this study was to determine by univariate and multivariate analyses the factors associated with clinically significant anastomotic leakage (AL) after large bowel resection. From 1990 to 1997 a series of 707 patients underwent colonic or rectal resection (without a stoma). Patients were divided into two groups: those with clinical anastomotic leakage (group 1) and those without it (group 2). AL occurred in 43 of 707 patients (6%). The overall mortality was 2.2% and was significantly higher in patients with AL than in those without: 5 of 43 (12%) versus 11 of 664 (1.6%), p < 0.001. Univariate analysis showed 15 variables associated with the risk of AL: previous abdominal or pelvic irradiation (p = 0.02), American Society of Anesthesiologists (ASA) score > 2 (p = 0.04), leukocytosis (p = 0.02), renal failure (p = 0.03), steroid treatment (p = 0.01), duration of operation (p = 0.001), intraoperative septic conditions (p = 0.006), total colectomy (p = 0.009), transverse colectomy (p = 0.02), difficulties encountered during anastomosis (p = 0.001), ileorectal anastomosis (p = 0.02), colocolic anastomosis (p = 0.01), abdominal drainage (p = 0.05), and blood transfusion intraoperatively (p = 0.006) and postoperatively (p = 0.001). Multivariate analysis showed that only preoperative leukocytosis (p = 0.04), intraoperative septic conditions (p = 0.001), difficulties encountered during anastomosis (p = 0.007), colocolic anastomosis (p = 0.004), and postoperative blood transfusion (p = 0.0007) were independent factors associated with AL. The risk of AL increased from a range of 12% to 30% if one risk factor was present, to 38% with two factors, to 50% with three factors. After colorectal resection and intraperitoneal anastomosis, a temporary protective stoma is proposed in selected patients with high risk factors for AL, as observed in our study.",

        "Title":"[Pharmacology of non-steroidal anti-inflammatory drugs and ENT pathology].",
        "Published":null,
        "Abstract":"UNLABELLED: 1.\nBACKGROUND: Non-steroidal anti-inflammatory drugs (NSAID) belong to a variety of chemical classes with no common features except the absence of a steroid structure. Their primary effect is pain relief, but also with anti-pyretic and anti-inflammatory effects. Basically prescribed for symptomatic relief, they do not have a curative effect on chronic disease processes. 2. INFLAMMATORY EFFECTS OF PROSTANOIDS (THROMBOXANE A2 AND PROSTAGLANDINS): Inflammation basically results from the pro-algogenic and vascular effects of prostanoids. Their pro-algogenic effects are explained by sensitization of nociceptive nerve endings to the stimulating effect (algogenic) of kinins (bradykinin), serotonin and histamine. In addition, production of prostanoids in the brain has a thermoregulatory effect. 3.\nMODE OF ACTION: NSAID have a common effect, inhibiting the production of prostanoids via reduced activity of two cyclo-oxygenases (COX-1 and COX-2). COX-2 is an isoform predominantly expressed during the inflammatory process. Excepting two compounds recently marketed (celecoxib, rofecoxib) selective for COX-2, all other NSAID have few or no selective properties. COX-1 is implicated in the regulation of many physiological functions. Inhibition of COX-1 explains most of the classical side effects of non-selective NSAID. 4.\nCOMPARISON: It is classical to emphasize the interindividual variable anti-inflammatory and antalgesic effects of the different NSAID without developing a coherent explanation. In addition, it is very difficult to make objective comparisons between different NSAID because of the different sizes of the study populations, indications and dosages. There is no evidence favoring a given NSAID on the basis of its anti-inflammatory or antalgesic effect in a given indication; no hierarchy in terms of efficacy can be established. For acute pain, it is preferable to use oral NSAID absorbed rapidly to achieve rapid relief. 5.\nPARACETAMOL: This antalgesic, antipyretic drug has no anti-inflammatory action. Its mechanism of action remains to be fully elucidated. It is not a member of the NSAID class and is a poor inhibitor of COX, particularly COX-2 (30% maximal inhibition). For identical dose (1-3 g\/d), the antalgesic activity of paracetamol is comparable to that of aspirin for pain in general. There does not appear to be any difference in the anti-pyretic efficacy between NSAID and paracetamol. 6.\nOFFICIAL INDICATIONS: In general, NSAID are not indicated for anti-inflammatory action in the ENT conditions discussed here. It this light, the official indications in France published on November 14, 1988 concerning ENT disease in children and adults without risk factors is most noteworthy. It is stipulated that there is no need to institute NSAID treatment at an anti-inflammatory dose in combination with general antibiotic therapy, except when there is an important inflammatory component. This guideline does not concern NSAID at antalgesic and antipyretic doses used for ENT conditions with or without an infectious component. 7. SELECTIVE INHIBITORS OF COX-2: Selective inhibitors are only indicated in two chronic inflammatory diseases: osteoarthritis and rheumatoid arthritis. There is no indication for these inhibitors in ENT disease. The only beneficial effect that has been demonstrated to date for the use of selective inhibitors of COX-2 is better digestive tract tolerance. 8.\nROLE OF PROSTANOIDS IN THE CLINICAL EXPRESSION OF ALLERGIC RHINITIS: It is insufficient to warrant use of NSAID in this disease, particularly due to the efficacy of anti-H1 and local corticosteroids. NSAID are not indicated in nasal polyposis and are even contraindicated in case of intolerance to NSAID, observed in about 15-20% of all patients with nasal polyposis. However, local application of lysine acetylsalicylate at progressive doses from 20 micrograms to 4 mg can reduce relapse by half after polypectomy. There is no proof of the efficacy of NSAID in chronic sinusitis and their efficacy has not been studied in laryngitis. Finally, there is no sufficient evidence, either from experimental data or clinical trials, to recommend NSAID for otitis, with the exception for an antalgesic and\/or antipyretic effect. 9. CHOOSING AN ANTI-INFLAMMATORY OR ANTALGESIC NSAID: The choice is generally guided by the frequency and severity of undesirable effects. These undesirable effects often appear during the first weeks of treatment. 10.\nDIFFERENT ADVERSE EFFECTS: Digestive tract effects appear in 20 to 40% of the patients after a few weeks of treatment using anti-inflammatory doses. Symptomatic gastroduodenal ulcers, digestive bleeding, and perforations are the most serious adverse effects of NSAID. Nevertheless, the risk of such complications, compared with the number of prescriptions, is very low. At high dose (anti-inflammatory dose), age over 60 years and history of severe gastrointestinal complications are factors increasing the risk of severe gastrointestinal adverse effects of NSAID. Minor adverse effects, and more importantly severe adverse effects, are significantly reduced with selective COX-2 inhibitors compared with classical NSAID. It is important to note that these beneficial effects in terms of tolerance are not better than with NSAID treatments except for treatments at anti-inflammatory doses for more than one week. Selective COX-2 inhibitors would have the same adverse effect on the kidney as classical NSAID, as pointed out by the precautions for use published by the manufacturers. COX-2 is not expressed by platelets. Specific inhibitors do not inhibit platelet aggregation and do not lengthen bleeding time. Specific inhibitors, like classical NSAID, are not recommended for women desiring pregnancy, especially because the risk of a teratogenic effect has not been excluded. Conversely, for patients with asthma triggered by classical NSAID, selective COX-2 inhibitors do not trigger acute asthma. Finally, selective COX-2 inhibitors are not currently indicated for children and not for ENT disease.",

However some reports have recently informed about increasing frequency of its also in non Asian people. The aim of this study was to evaluated own experiences on diagnosis and treatment of TA as well as prevalence of TA in hypertensive patients in Caucasian population.\nMATERIALS AND METHODS: During last 15 years we examined 4190 hypertensive patients hospitalized in our department. Renovascular hypertension was recognized in 139 cases. The diagnosis of TA was based on angiographically proven vascular changes and its inflammatory phase on estimation increased (> 40 mm\/h) sedimentation rate and immunoglobulins above normal level. The patients with acute phase of TA initially received typical immunosuppressive therapy (prednisone in monotherapy or combined with azatioprine or cyclophosphamide), followed by chronic administration of prednisone. In every case, if it was possible, we proposed angio-corrective procedure. All patients have received hypotensive and antiplatelet therapy.\nRESULTS: TA was recognized in 15 patients--4 men and 11 women, average age 36.3 +\/- 9.8 y. The patients with TA represented 0.37% hypertensive and 10.9% cases of renovascular hypertension. Significant stenosis of renal artery and various degree of lesions in aorta and some arteries was discovered in all persons. In the observed group hypertension was effectively controlled with 2-3 hypotensive drugs, including ACE inhibitors, diuretics and Ca antagonists. The acute phase of TA was diagnosed in 11 patients and it was treated successfully (except one case) with immunosuppressive therapy. After discontinuation of the treatment (4 patients) progression of the disease was observed. In 6 patients, characterised by clinical and biochemical remission of acute phase percutaneous angioplasty renal artery was performed. A good result in long-term follow-up period was observed in 4 cases (in 2 after repeated procedure). Surgical procedure was performed in 4 cases--in 2 on carotid and in 1 on renal and the next one on coronary artery. In first 3 cases the procedures were unsuccessful (reocclusion ?).\nCONCLUSIONS: Our observation suggested that 1. The incidence of TA in hypertensive (especially renovascular hypertension) population is more frequent than expected. 2. Acute phase of the disease is indication to long-term the immunosuppressive therapy. 3. Angiocorrective procedure is necessary reflected in every case in period of remission of acute phase.",

        "Abstract":"OBJECTIVE: The current literature emphasizes increased risk of adverse outcomes in the presence of proteinuria and hypertension. The objective of this study was to compare the frequency of adverse fetal outcomes in women who developed hypertensive disorders with or without proteinuria.\nSTUDY DESIGN: The study design was a secondary analysis of data from women who had preeclampsia in a previous pregnancy (n = 598) who were enrolled in a multicenter trial of aspirin for the prevention of preeclampsia. The women had no history of chronic hypertension or renal disease and were normotensive at study inclusion. The maternal and perinatal outcome variables assessed were preterm delivery at <37 and <35 weeks of gestation, rate of small-for-gestational-age infants, and abruptio placenta. Data were analyzed by using the chi-square test, and women who remained normotensive or who had mild gestational hypertension were considered as a single group because they had similar outcomes.\nRESULTS: As compared to mild preeclampsia, women who developed severe gestational hypertension (without proteinuria) had higher rates of both preterm delivery at <37 weeks of gestation and small-for-gestational-age infants. In addition, when compared to women with mild preeclampsia, for women with severe gestational hypertension, gestational age and birth weight were significantly lower at delivery (P <.003 for both age and birth weight). Moreover, women who developed severe gestational hypertension had higher rates of preterm delivery at <37 weeks of gestation (54.2% vs 17.8%, P =.001) and at <35 weeks of gestation (25.0% vs 8.4%, P =.0161), and delivery of small-for-gestational-age infants (20.8% vs 6.5%, P =.024) when compared to women who remained normotensive or those who developed mild gestational hypertension. There were no statistically significant differences in perinatal outcomes between the normotensive\/mild gestational hypertension and the mild preeclampsia groups. Overall, women who had severe gestational hypertension had increased rates of preterm delivery and delivery of small-for-gestational-age infants than women with mild gestational hypertension or mild preeclampsia. In the presence of severe hypertension, proteinuria did not increase the rates of preterm delivery or delivery of small-for-gestational-age infants.\nCONCLUSIONS: In women who have gestational hypertension or preeclampsia, increased rates of preterm delivery and delivery of small-for-gestational-age infants are present only in those with severe hypertension. In these women, the presence of proteinuria does not influence perinatal outcome.",

Urine glutathione-S-transferase (GST)-alpha indexed to urine creatinine (GST-alpha\/creatinine) and GST-pi\/creatinine were increased 2 h after anesthesia and returned to baseline values thereafter in both groups. There were no changes in serum cystatin C and urine kallikrein or urine output per hour between groups. The perioperative administration of ketorolac to healthy, well hydrated patients anesthetized with sevoflurane did not produce renal glomerular or tubular dysfunction.\nIMPLICATIONS: Ketorolac 90 mg IM, given in divided doses over approximately 10 h to patients anesthetized with sevoflurane with a fresh gas flow rate of 4-6 L\/min, did not result in clinically significant changes in renal glomerular or tubular function.",

The effect on anticoagulation was observed and compared. Plasma levels of thromboxane B2 (TXB2), 6-keto-prostaglandin F1 alpha (6-Keto-PGF1 alpha), endothelin (ET), calcitonin gene related peptide (CGRP) were determined before and after treatment, and at the time of reducing dose and turning to maintenance dose of prednisone. The therapeutic effect of the two groups were also observed. Another group of 30 healthy person was established for control.\nRESULTS: The difference of TXB2, 6-Keto-PGF1 alpha, ET, CGRP between patients and healthy persons was very significant before treatment (P < 0.001). Above-mentioned 4 parameters improved synchronously with the clinical improvement in the therapeutic course and they were better in the TCM-WM group than those in the western medicine group (P < 0.001) and the complete remission rate of the former group was also higher than that of the latter (62.9% vs 37.1%, chi 2 = 4.63, P < 0.05).\nCONCLUSION: BHD could improve the therapeutic effect in treating PNS through the mechanism of improving TXB2, 6-Keto-PGF1 alpha, ET and CGRP levels.",

Seven occurred in women with antiphospholipid syndrome. At pregnancy onset, all but one woman had creatininaemia below 100 micromol\/l, five had proteinuria >0.5 g\/day, none had hypertension. Twelve pregnancies occurred in women previously treated with immunosuppressant drugs. Treatment comprised prednisone (n=31), hydroxychloroquine (n=11), aspirin (n=22), heparin (n=12), and azathioprine in one patient with steroid resistant nephrotic syndrome disclosing SLE. No therapeutic abortion was done. During pregnancy or the postpartum period, or both, proteinuria >0.5 g\/day occurred in 10 women (five related to pre-eclampsia, four to renal flare, one to stable nephrotic syndrome). One flare consisted of mild arthralgias. Pregnancy outcome comprised one feto-maternal death in SLE disclosed by pregnancy, five embryonic losses, two fetal deaths, and 18 premature (one neonatal death) and six full term births. No criterion appeared to influence fetal survival significantly. At long term, one patient died during an SLE flare, three women had renal relapses. At the last visit, all had creatininaemia below 100 micromol\/l except one woman with creatinine level 115 micromol\/l, nine had proteinuria >0.5 g\/day, and one was treated for hypertension.\nCONCLUSION: Pregnancy need not be discouraged in women with a history of SLE nephritis with normal or mildly impaired renal function. Deterioration of renal function rarely occurs. However, these pregnancies are at high risk of pre-eclampsia and prematurity.",

        "Abstract":"OBJECTIVE: Our objective was to assess the safety, tolerability, pharmacokinetics, and pharmacodynamics of lotrafiban, an oral glycoprotein IIb\/IIIa inhibitor, in patients with a recent myocardial infarction, unstable angina, transient ischemic attack, or stroke.\nMETHODS: A 12-week, double-blind, multi-center, placebo-controlled, parallel-group, phase II study of lotrafiban (the Anti-platelet Useful Dose Study) was conducted in patients. Lotrafiban or placebo was administered as a twice daily oral dose at four dose levels (5-100 mg) for 12 weeks with daily doses of aspirin (300-325 mg). The pharmacokinetics of lotrafiban were characterized with the use of a population approach and were described by a two-compartment model with first order absorption and first order elimination. The pharmacodynamic data, ex vivo platelet aggregation, were described with the use of a direct effect inhibitory sigmoidal model with a baseline. The relationship between the severity of bleeding episodes and predicted steady-state lotrafiban exposure was characterized by logistic regression.\nRESULTS: Pharmacokinetic analysis showed that increasing age and decreasing creatinine clearance resulted in increased exposure to lotrafiban. The concentration-effect relationship was steep, with near complete inhibition of platelet aggregation at lotrafiban concentrations in excess of 20 ng\/mL. Logistic regression showed that at exposures that exceeded approximately 835 ng. h\/mL, the severity of adverse bleeding events increased considerably; this suggested that dosing recommendations should be generated to minimize the likelihood of patients having an area under the plasma concentration-time curve from 0 to 24 hours in excess of this value.\nCONCLUSIONS: Patients whose age exceeded 65 years or whose creatinine clearance was less than 60 mL\/min should be given a lower dose of lotrafiban than younger patients with good renal function.",

In addition, data indicate that enoxaparin given with low-dosage aspirin is more effective than UFH in treating acute coronary syndromes. Anti-Xa activity can be used as a biologic marker of LMWH activity. Because of the more predictable anticoagulant response to subcutaneous administration of LMWHs compared with UFH, routine monitoring of anti-Xa activity in clinically stable adults with uncomplicated disease is not recommended. Because the optimal dosage of LMWHs has not been established for patients with renal insufficiency or extremes of body weight, during pregnancy, or for children, anti-Xa activity monitoring may be warranted in these subsets.",

        "Abstract":"BACKGROUND: Conflicting data exist about proteinuria in inflammatory bowel diseases. It is still unclear whether the occurrence of proteinuria in inflammatory bowel disease patients is an extra-intestinal manifestation of disease or the result of adverse effects to medication, especially to aminosalicylates (ASA).\nMETHODS: A total of 95 patients (51 with Crohn's disease and 44 with ulcerative colitis) were enrolled in the study. Disease activity was assessed by Crohn's Disease Activity Index (CDAI) or the Truelove index, respectively. Urine was collected over 24 h and protein excretion of specific marker proteins for tubular (alpha 1-microglobulin-alpha 1-MG) and glomerular (albumin-Alb, Immunoglobulin G-IgG) dysfunction was measured using a highly sensitive immunoluminometric assay.\nRESULTS: Out of 51 Crohn's disease patients, 20 showed elevated urinary alpha 1-MG. The amount of alpha 1-MGuria was strongly correlated to the CDAI (r=0.6, P < 0.001). Only four Crohn's disease patients showed slightly elevated values for glomerular proteins in urine. Similar results were obtained for ulcerative colitis: whereas only two ulcerative colitis patients showed albuminuria, tubular proteinuria was detected in 28 out of 44 ulcerative colitis patients. Proteinuria was strongly dependent on disease activity (P < 0.01) but was not related to ASA treatment.\nCONCLUSIONS: Proteinuria of tubular marker proteins occurs in the majority of inflammatory bowel disease patients and is related to disease activity rather than to ASA treatment. Tubular proteinuria seems to reflect a renal extra-intestinal manifestation of inflammatory bowel disease and may serve as a new relevant marker of disease activity.",

        "Abstract":"OBJECTIVES: transfemoral endoluminal aortic management (TEAM) is technically feasible in the treatment of infrarenal abdominal aortic aneurysms but its advantage over conventional repair is unproved. We report our initial experience, learning curve and technical difficulties encountered during the process of establishing this novel technique in our institute.\nMATERIAL AND METHODS: over a 3-year period 400 cases of abdominal aortic aneurysms were reviewed; only 58 cases (15%) were suitable for endovascular repair under our TEAM protocol and 36 (9%) were offered endovascular intervention. They were mainly high-risk patients (85% ASA III and IV) with a mean age of 72 years. Thirty-three bifurcated grafts, two straight tube grafts and one aorto mono-iliac graft were deployed. We oversized the graft by 15-20% to the diameter of the aortic neck and both common iliac arteries.\nRESULTS: two cases (6%-95% CI: 1-19%) had on-table conversion because of ruptured common iliac arteries. Peri-operatively there were two deaths from multi-organ failure. Transient renal failure occurred in two patients and three patients (9%) suffered a non-fatal myocardial infarction. Sixteen percent of patients had a groin wound problem. The mean hospital stay was 7 days. Five minor endoleaks (15%) were identified and sealed at 30 days. One secondary endoleak was identified at 18 months because of a patent juxta-renal lumbar artery. No secondary cuffs or extensions were used. Mean follow-up was 29 months and all grafts remained patent. The technical, clinical, continuous and secondary success rates were 78%, 91%, 89% and 91% respectively with TEAM.\nCONCLUSION: endovascular training, patient selection and learning curve impose an impact on the final outcome. Until a reliable hard point is reached so that endovascular repair could be exercised in routine practice, the use of TEAM must be questioned in high-risk patients, and should be performed under clinical trial conditions using strict selection criteria.",

        "Abstract":"To date there are only few reports evaluating the potential nephrotoxic reactions of the new 5-aminosalicylic acid (5-ASA) preparations in patients with ulcerative colitis (UC). The aim of this study was to screen the tubular and glomerular functions in patients with UC in maintenance treatment with either 5-ASA azo-compounds (sulphasalazine and olsalazine) or mesalazine. Patients with UC in clinical remission treated with either sulphasalazine, olsalazine, or mesalazine for more than 1 year were included in an open, single-blind retrospective Norwegian multicenter study. Serum and urine creatinine, serum and urine beta2-microglobulin, urine N-acetyl-beta-glucoseamidase (NAG), urine alkaline phosphatase, urine microalbumin, urine alanine amino peptidase, and urine beta2-microglobulin were measured. Fifty-two females and 75 males (n = 127), ages 20-69, were evaluated. Thirty-six patients were treated with sulphasalazine (mean treatment time 10.1+\/-6.6 years [mean +\/- SD]), 32 patients were treated with olsalazine (2.3+\/-1.4 years), and 59 patients with mesalazine (3.2+\/-2.0 years). At inclusion, there were no significant differences in the serum or urine values between the groups. In 17 patients (1 patient [3%] in the sulphasalazine group, 4 patients [13%] in the olsalazine group, and 12 patients [20%] in the mesalazine group), at least one abnormal serum and\/or urine value was detected. After 10 years of treatment, only one abnormal value was found among the 19 patients in the sulphasalazine group. The abnormal values observed in the other groups indicated minor glomerular or tubular renal damage. In conclusion, long term sulphasalazine treatment appears to be safe and free of nephrotoxic side effects, whereas minor glomerular and tubular impairment are observed in a few patients treated with olsalazine and mesalazine.",

        "Abstract":"OBJECTIVE: To conduct a systematic review of evidence relating to management of mild chronic hypertension during pregnancy, including associated risks, benefits, and harms of treatment with antihypertensive agents, nonpharmacologic measures, and aspirin and benefits of various monitoring strategies.\nDATA SOURCES: Using four broad search strategies, we searched English and non-English-language citations in 16 electronic databases from their inception to February 1999 and consulted relevant textbooks, references, and experts.\nSTUDY SELECTION: Reviewers screened 6228 abstracts and found 215 articles that met multiple prespecified patient selection, study population, and design criteria.\nTABULATION, INTEGRATION, AND RESULTS: Forty-six studies consistently showed that chronic hypertension triples the risk for perinatal mortality (odds ratio [OR] 3.4; 95% confidence interval [CI] 3.0, 3.7) and doubles the risk for placental abruption (OR 2.1; 95% CI 1.1, 3.9). Thirteen small, randomized controlled trials had inadequate power to rule in or rule out moderate-to-large (20%-50%) benefits of antihypertensive treatment. Possible adverse effects were fetal renal failure when angiotensin-converting enzyme inhibitors are used in the second or third trimester and growth restriction when atenolol is used early in pregnancy. Trials showed that aspirin neither reduces nor increases perinatal and maternal morbidity, but they did not rule out possible small-to moderate beneficial or adverse effects. No studies provide guidance on benefits or consequences of various nonpharmacologic therapies or monitoring strategies.\nCONCLUSION: Mild chronic hypertension is associated with increased maternal and fetal risks. Beneficial treatment and monitoring regimens are not clear, but some treatments, such as angiotensin-converting enzyme inhibitors, are best avoided.",

        "Abstract":"Despite limited understanding of therapeutic aetiopathogenesis of ulcerative colitis and Crohn's disease, there is a strong evidence base for the efficacy of pharmacological and biological therapies. It is equally important to recognise toxicity of the medical armamentarium for inflammatory bowel disease (IBD). Sulfasalazine consists of sulfapyridine linked to 5-aminosalicylic acid (5-ASA) via an azo bond. Common adverse effects related to sulfapyridine 'intolerance' include headache, nausea, anorexia, and malaise. Other allergic or toxic adverse effects include fever, rash, haemolytic anaemia, hepatitis, pancreatitis, paradoxical worsening of colitis, and reversible sperm abnormalities. The newer 5-ASA agents were developed to deliver the active ingredient of sulfasalazine while minimising adverse effects. Adverse effects are infrequent but may include nausea, dyspepsia and headache. Olsalazine may cause a secretory diarrhoea. Uncommon hypersensitivity reactions, including worsening of colitis, pancreatitis, pericarditis and nephritis, have also been reported. Corticosteroids are commonly prescribed for treatment of moderate to severe IBD. Despite short term efficacy, corticosteroids have numerous adverse effects that preclude their long term use. Adverse effects include acne, fluid retention, fat redistribution, hypertension, hyperglycaemia, psycho-neurological disturbances, cataracts, adrenal suppression, growth failure in children, and osteonecrosis. Newer corticosteroid preparations offer potential for targeted therapy and less corticosteroid-related adverse effects. Azathioprine and mercaptopurine are associated with pancreatitis in 3 to 15% of patients that resolves upon drug cessation. Bone marrow suppression is dose related and may be delayed. The adverse effects of methotrexate include nausea, leucopenia and, rarely, hypersensitivity pneumonia or hepatic fibrosis. Common adverse effects of cyclosporin include nephrotoxicity, hypertension, headache, gingival hyperplasia, hyperkalaemia, paresthesias, and tremors. These adverse effects usually abate with dose reduction or cessation of therapy. Seizures and opportunistic infections have also been reported. Antibacterials are commonly employed as primary therapy for Crohn's disease. Common adverse effects of metronidazole include nausea and a metallic taste. Peripheral neuropathy can occur with prolonged administration. Ciprofloxacin and other antibacterials may be beneficial in those intolerant to metronidazole. Newer immunosuppressive agents previously reserved for transplant recipients are under investigation for IBD. Tacrolimus has an adverse effect profile similar to cyclosporin, and may cause renal insufficiency. Mycophenolate mofetil, a purine synthesis inhibitor, has primarily gastrointestinal adverse effects. Biological agents targeting specific sites in the immunoinflammatory cascade are now available to treat IBD. Infliximab, a chimeric antibody targeting tumour necrosis factor-or has been well tolerated in clinical trials and early postmarketing experience. Additional trials are needed to assess long term adverse effects.",

        "Abstract":"In early childhood, nonsteroidal anti-inflammatory drugs are mainly used to either prevent or treat premature labor of the mother and patent ductus arteriosus of the newborn infant. The most frequently used prostaglandin-synthesis inhibitor is indomethacin. Fetuses exposed to indomethacin in utero have been born with renal developmental defects, and in both the unborn child and the term and premature newborn this drug may compromise renal glomerular function. The latter has in the past also been observed when i.v. indomethacin or i.v. acetylsalicylic acid (aspirin) were administered to newborn rabbits. The present experiments were designed to evaluate whether ibuprofen has less renal side effects than indomethacin, as claimed. Three groups of anesthetized, ventilated, normoxemic neonatal rabbits were infused with increasing doses of ibuprofen (0.02, 0.2, 2.0 mg\/kg body weight) and the following renal parameters were measured: urine volume, urinary sodium excretion, GFR, and renal plasma flow. Renal blood flow, filtration fraction, and the renal vascular resistance were calculated according to standard formulae. Intravenous ibuprofen caused a dose-dependent, significant reduction in urine volume, GFR, and renal blood flow with a fall in filtration fraction in the animals receiving the highest dose of ibuprofen (2 mg\/kg body weight). There was a very steep rise in renal vascular resistance. Urinary sodium excretion decreased. These experiments in neonatal rabbits clearly show that acute i.v. doses of ibuprofen also have significant renal hemodynamic and functional side effects, not less than seen previously with indomethacin.",

        "Abstract":"PURPOSE: Prostaglandins play important roles in renal physiology and in the development of renovascular hypertension. In a recent study, inhibition of renal prostaglandin synthesis was found to be useful for detecting renovascular hypertension using renal scintigraphy. In the current study, the authors evaluated the role of aspirin (an inhibitor of prostaglandin synthesis) and compared it with Tc-99m DTPA captopril renal scintigraphy (CS).\nMATERIALS AND METHODS: Twenty-five patients were examined with Tc-99m DTPA in a three-step manner: a baseline study, CS, and aspirin scintigraphy (AS). Each scintigraphic study was interpreted visually and according to the renogram curve patterns. Semiquantitative parameters (Tmax, renal indices [%], 20-minute\/max count ratio, glomerular filtration rate) were also calculated. Plasma renin activity was determined for each study. The blood pressures of all patients were measured during AS. All patients had a contrast-enhanced angiogram that was used as the reference test.\nRESULTS: Three groups of patients were observed based on the scintigraphic and angiographic results. In each group, no difference was observed in blood pressure after aspirin administration. In group 1, seven patients had normal angiographic and scintigraphic results. In group 2, eight patients had angiographically confirmed renal artery stenosis (RAS). In 6 patients (mean, 47% RAS), both AS and CS were negative for RVH. In the remaining two patients with RAS (mean, 83% stenosis), the kidneys were atrophic on the stenotic side, and thus the kidneys did not respond to the interventions. No difference was observed in plasma renin activity in groups 1 and 2. Group 3 included 10 patients who had angiographically confirmed RAS (mean, 86%). In 9 patients, both CS and AS were positive for RVH. In the remaining one patient, scintigraphic results were falsely negative. Statistical analyses performed for semiquantitative parameters did not reveal any significant difference in this group, although there was a tendency toward prolonged Tmax values after captopril and aspirin administration. In four cases, unexpected elevation of plasma renin activity was observed in group 3.\nCONCLUSIONS: These data indicate that AS with Tc-99m DTPA is an alternative for CS. It has the advantage of having no effect on blood pressure and does not require that angiotensin-converting enzyme inhibitors be discontinued. Although in this study 9 of 10 patients had correct diagnoses of RAS, further studies, especially using tubular agents with the calculation of parenchymal transit time, might provide valuable information in this patient group. An ongoing study is being performed in the authors' institute.",

        "Abstract":"The postoperative pain treatment is one of important factors of a successful outcome after kidney transplantation. Improperly controlled pain leads to agitation, tachycardia, hypertension and increases risk of respiratory complications. Many studies have demonstrated good analgetic effect of morphine delivered by the method of patient controlled analgesia (PCA). Because the intensity of postoperative pain in end-stage kidney insufficiency patients can be modified by the type of received anaesthesia, it was decided to analyze the influence of standardized general anaesthesia on postoperative morphine consumption. 140 (ASA III) patients scheduled for kidney transplantation were included. Patients were divided into four groups; group K (control)--anaesthetised with fentanyl and N2O, group 1--fentanyl, N2O plus halothane, group 2--fentanyl, N2O plus propofol, group 3--fentanyl, N2O plus isoflurane. After operation and initial loading dose, PCA infusion of morphine was started. Bolus doses were set to 30 ug\/kg, and lockout interval 10 min. Our results suggest that observed greater morphine consumption after GA with the use of propofol is connected with better psychomotor functions. In that group patients were better oriented and more efficiently controlled the PCA pump and pain.",

        "Abstract":"OBJECTIVE: To review the rate, risk factors, and potential prevention of preeclampsia in women with pregravid diabetes mellitus.\nMETHODS: Detailed review of recent English literature describing pregnancy outcome in women with pregravid insulin-dependent diabetes mellitus (Type 1 diabetes). The primary focus of the review is risk factors for preeclampsia and potential methods suggested for prevention of preeclampsia. In addition, pitfalls in diagnosis of preeclampsia will be emphasized.\nRESULTS: The reported rate of preeclampsia ranged from 9% to 66%. This rate increased with increased severity of diabetes by White's classification, with the highest rate reported in women with pregravid diabetic nephropathy. Risk factors identified for preeclampsia were nulliparity, chronic hypertension, microalbuminuria prior to pregnancy, nephropathy, and poor glycemic control early in pregnancy. There is lack of agreement among reports in the literature concerning criteria used to diagnose preeclampsia. There are two randomized trials that included women with Type 1 diabetes who were randomized to receive either low-dose aspirin or placebo. There was no reduction in the rate of preeclampsia with low-dose aspirin in either trial.\nCONCLUSIONS: In women with pregravid Type 1 diabetes, the rates of preeclampsia and adverse neonatal outcome increase with increased severity of diabetes. Low-dose aspirin does not reduce rate of preeclampsia in such women. Further studies should address the role of good glycemic control prior to 20 weeks gestation and prevention of microalbuminuria.",

        "Abstract":"BACKGROUND: The goal of the present multicenter, prospective, randomized clinical investigation was to compare the clinical efficacy and safety of sevoflurane and isoflurane during maintenance of and recovery from general anaesthesia in adult patients.\nMETHODS: With the approval of the Ethical Committee and the patient informed consent, 143 ASA physical status I-II patients, aged 18-65 years, were randomized in order to receive either isoflurane (n = 71) or sevoflurane (n = 72) as the main general anaesthetic. After an oral diazepam (0.1-0.2 mg kg-1) and atropine (0.007-0.01 mg kg-1) premedication and a standardized intravenous induction, general anaesthesia was maintained by adjusting the end-tidal concentrations of the inhalational agent for the maintainance of cardiovascular stability. At the end of surgery the anaesthetic vapours were discontinued, and the neuromuscular block was reversed; the following times were recorded: time of eyes opening, time of command response and suitability for discharge from the recovery area. The occurrence of any untoward event was also recorded. Preoperatively and 24 hr after surgery, blood was collected in order to assess renal an hepatic functions.\nRESULTS: No differences in demography, duration of surgery, exposure to the inhalational agent and haemodynamic effects were observed between the two groups. Patients receiving sevoflurane showed shorter times for the achievement of extubation (median: 9 min versus 13 min, p = 0.002), eyes opening (median: 10 min versus 13 min, p = 0.002), command response (11 min versus 15 min, p = 0.002) and suitability for discharge from recovery room (median: 19 min versus 22 min, p < 0.05) than those receiving isofluorane. No intra- and intergroup differences were observed in pre- and post-operative laboratory testing of renal and hepatic function.\nDISCUSSION: We conclude that sevoflurane, when compared to isoflurane, provides a similarly safe maintenance but allows for a more rapid emergence from general anaesthesia.",

They were divided into two groups: PSL+CPA group (n = 26, male\/female = 11\/15, age 40+\/-3 years (SEM)) or control group undergone conventional therapy with or without antiplatelet agents (n = 19, male\/female = 10\/9, age 41+\/-3). In PSL+CPA group, PSL and CPA treatment commenced using a dose of 30 and 50 mg\/day, respectively. PSL was reduced by 5 mg every month.\nRESULTS: The clinical parameters at the start of treatment such as age, gender, histological score, blood pressure, urinary protein excretion and serum creatinine concentration (SCr) were not different between the groups. The mean observation period in PSL+CPA group (3.3+\/-0.3 years) was not different from the control group (4.0+\/-0.7 years). In PSL+CPA group, urinary protein excretion, defined as the ratio of urinary protein to creatinine concentration (UP\/UCr), significantly decreased from 3.9+\/-0.4 to 1.3 +\/-0.2 (p<0.01), whereas it remained high in the control group (3.8+\/-0.7 to 2.7+\/-0.8). The progression rate (PR), which was determined by the slope of the correlation between time after renal biopsy and reciprocal SCr, was significantly lower in PSL+CPA (0.054+\/-0.014) than in the control group (0.172+\/-0.032 dl\/mg\/year, p<0.001). Our results indicated that PSL+CPA combination therapy was effective in slowing the progression of moderately advanced IgAN.\nCONCLUSION: We suggest that the immunosuppressive treatment with CPA is sometimes necessary to preserve renal function in patients with histologically advanced IgAN.",

        "Published":null,
        "Abstract":"INTRODUCTION: Several new derivatives of sulphasalazine that make use of its active moiety, 5-aminosalicylic acid (5-ASA), have been introduced for the treatment of inflammatory bowel disease (IBD). In rats short term intravenous administration of 5-ASA has been associated with nephrotoxicity. A number of cases of nephrotoxicity have been reported recently in IBD patients taking oral maintenance treatment with 5-ASA compounds.\nOBJECTIVE: To study the urinary and serum levels of acetylated 5-ASA (Ac-5-ASA) and the unacetylated 5-ASA (5-ASA) in patients with IBD maintained on sulphasalazine, olsalazine and mesalazine (pH dependent release form). We also sought correlation between levels of 5-ASA, clinical disease activity and extent of disease.\nMETHODS: We studied 79 patients (male, n = 30; female, n = 49) with established IBD [ulcerative colitis (UC), n = 48; Crohn's disease (CD), n = 31], 72 maintained on 5-ASA compounds (sulphasalazine = 27; olsalazine = 28; mesalazine = 17) and 7 patients were receiving no medication. Urinary and serum analysis of 5-ASA was performed by high performance liquid chromatography (HPLC). Clinical disease activity was quantified using simple index of Harvey and Bradshaw.\nRESULTS: Patients receiving mesalazine had significantly higher levels of serum free 5-ASA compared to those who were receiving olsalazine and sulphasalazine (mesalazine mean +\/- SEM; range; 2.84 +\/- 1.21 (0.00-16.00) vs olsalazine 0.45 +\/- 0.18 (0.00-16.20); mumol\/L; p < 0.04; sulphasalazine 0.37 +\/- 0.25 (0.00-3.74); p < 0.03). Similarly levels of urinary free 5-ASA were significantly higher in patients maintained on mesalazine compared to those on olsalazine or sulphasalazine (mesalazine 219 +\/- 80.43 (0.00-1050) vs olsalazine 33.3 +\/- 17.23 (0.00-317) mumol\/L; p < 0.01; and sulphasalazine 15 +\/- 8.86 (0.00-192); p < 0.05). However, no significant difference was observed in the levels of urinary free 5-ASA between olsalazine and sulphasalazine. No significant difference was observed in the levels of free-5-ASA in UC patients with left sided disease and those with extensive disease. Furthermore, no significant difference was observed in the levels of serum and urinary 5-ASA in CD patients with ileo-colic disease and colonic disease. Urinary and serum free-5-ASA did not correlate with the clinical disease activity.\nCONCLUSION: Systemic absorption of 5-ASA from sulphasalazine and olsalazine is relatively low. However, pH-dependent mesalazine formulations may release their contents rapidly in the small intestine and proximal colon resulting in higher plasma and urinary concentrations of free 5-ASA. The effects of free 5-ASA on renal function in the human require further evaluation.",

Subjects in whom severe hypertensive disease developed were selected. The primary outcomes were the overall frequencies of cesarean delivery among women with severe hypertensive disease who had labor with and without epidural anesthesia. Other maternal and neonatal outcomes were also compared between women who did and did not receive epidural anesthesia.\nRESULTS: Among the women with severe hypertensive disease (n = 444) 327 had labor. Among the women with severe disease who had labor there was no difference in either the overall cesarean delivery rate (32.1% vs 28.0%; P =.44) or the rate of cesarean delivery for fetal distress or failure to progress (27.8% vs 22.0%; P =.26) between women who did and did not receive epidural analgesia. Women with chronic hypertension were more likely to have a cesarean delivery overall if they received epidural anesthesia, but there was otherwise no difference in the frequencies of cesarean delivery for these indications between women with and without epidural anesthesia within each of the high-risk groups. Pulmonary edema was rare and acute renal failure did not develop in any women.\nCONCLUSION: Epidural anesthesia use did not increase the frequencies of cesarean delivery, pulmonary edema, and renal failure among women with severe hypertensive disease.",

        "Abstract":"Hypertension in pregnancy is defined by a systolic blood pressure > or = 140 mm Hg and a diastolic blood pressure of > or = 90 mm Hg or by a rise in blood pressure of systolic > or = 30 mm Hg and diastolic > or = 15 mm Hg. High blood pressures are found in 5-10% of all pregnancies. The outcome of pregnancy is influenced by the fact whether there occurs a proteinuria in addition to hypertension. While the prognosis of an isolated hypotension is good, the combination of hypertension and proteinuria leading to preeclampsia is the primary cause of maternal death in many countries and is responsible for 20-25% of perinatal mortality. A simple classification divides between chronic hypertension, preeclampsia, preeclampsia superimposed on chronic hypertension and transient hypertension. With chronic hypertension pregnancy outcome is determined by a preexisting nephropathy and the occurrence of a superimposed preeclampsia. Preeclampsia and superimposed preeclampsia are pregnancy induced multiorganic diseases, endangering both the mother and the fetus. Transient hypertension is a benign pathology, which occurs toward the end of pregnancy usually on the basis of a latent essential hypertension, which is laid open through pregnancy. While a severe chronic hypertension in pregnancy must be treated to prevent a hypertensive maternal encephalopathy, a less severe chronic hypertension should not be treated as the risk of a superimposed preeclampsia and the maternal and fetal outcome cannot be influenced by antihypertensive therapy. The incidence of preeclampsia is 3-5% in nulliparae and 0.5% in multiparae. Preeclampsia is a severe and dangerous pathology with an unknown etiology. Pregnancy termination is the only causal therapy. At present it is still recommended to terminate a severe preeclampsia after stabilizing the mother, irrespective of gestational age. In less severe preeclampsia occurring before 32 weeks of gestation, termination of pregnancy can be postponed under intensive monitoring and a prophylaxis with magnesium sulfate in order to accelerate the fetal lung maturation with glucocorticoids. A conservative management in the case of a HELLP-syndrome (Haemolyis, Elevated Liver enzymes, Low Platelets), which is a very severe form of preeclampsia, is not recommended because it hasn't been validated in prospective controlled studies. The most dangerous complication of preeclampsia is eclampsia, which is defined by general tonic-clonic convulsions before or after birth. The most effective prophylaxis of eclamptic attacks is the intravenous therapy with magnesium sulfate. A primary prohylaxis for preeclampsia doesn't exist. Treatment with low-dose aspirin in high-risk patients, i.e. after a severe preeclampsia, in cases of chronic hypertension, in cases of nephropathy and in cases with antiphospholipid-syndrome++ can be recommended. The prophylactic use of low-dose heparin, which has lead to a significant decreased incidence of preeclampsia in retrospective analysis, is now the object of a randomized, controlled trial in our hospital. All women who suffered from a preeclampsia should have a check-up after 3-6 months. Preexisting pathologies are found in up to 40% of patients, mostly in multiparae, i.e. chronic hypertension, nephropathy, endocrine pathologies, anomalies of blood coagulation and antiphospolipid-syndrome.",

Because of his low incidence, prospective randomized clinical trials are difficult to conduct and apart from plasma exchanges (PE) which appear superior to plasma infusions (PI), other therapeutic recommendations are based on retrospective studies or on anecdotal reports with limited number of patients. In the absence of appropriate therapy, mortality rate was initially above 90% in adults with TTP. Plasma infusions and plasma exchanges have dramatically improved prognosis of the disease, since more than 80% of patients respond to therapy with a survival greater than 80 to 90%. Analysis of data of medical literature shows that plasma exchanges can cure 82% of TMA with 15% of refractory TMA and a mortality rate of 14%. In two randomized trials, PE are more effective than PI with a response rate benefit of 25% and an overall survival increase of 15%. Although severe thrombocytopenia is frequently observed, it is important to avoid platelet transfusions. Platelets infusions induce deleterious effects since they add to the severity and the extend of microvascular thrombi formation. Use of glucocorticoids, heparin, antiplatelet therapy, intravenous immunoglobulin and vincristine are associated with variable results and no controlled study supports their use. Splenectomy is still under discussion but could be of interest in case of relapsing thrombotic microangiopathies as an attempt to reduce the rate of TMA recurrence.",

Intravenous therapy with platelet glycoprotein (GP) IIb\/IIIa receptor antagonists improves outcome in patients with acute coronary syndromes (ACS). Whether potent long-term antiplatelet therapy with oral GP IIb\/IIIa antagonists will further improve outcome at a dose that is tolerable in long-term treatment is unknown.\nTRIAL DESIGN: SYMPHONY (Sibrafiban versus aspirin to Yield Maximum Protection from ischemic Heart events post-acute cOroNary syndromes) was a randomized, double-blind, aspirin-controlled trial with 2 concentration regimens of sibrafiban, an oral peptidomimetic GP IIb\/IIIa antagonist, for long-term treatment instead of aspirin in patients after an ACS. Patients were eligible for SYMPHONY if they presented within 7 days of an ACS (>\/=20 minutes of ischemic symptoms), had been clinically stable for at least 12 hours, and met one of the following inclusion criteria: ST-segment depression or elevation of at least 0.5 mm or new left bundle branch block with the ACS or elevated creatinine kinase MB more than the upper limit of normal and >3% of total creatine kinase or, if creatine kinase MB was not measured, an elevated level of troponin T or I. Approximately 9000 patients post ACS were randomized 1:1:1 to treatment with either aspirin (80 mg every 12 hours) or high-dose or low-dose sibrafiban every 12 hours. Assignment of tablet strength (3, 4.5, or 6 mg) within the sibrafiban arms was based on body weight and renal function to achieve a target steady-state plasma concentration. The duration of study drug therapy was 90 days. Patients who had intracoronary stenting during the course of the study initially received a blinded stent medication assignment for 2 to 4 weeks based on their initial randomization as follows: aspirin\/ticlopidine 250 mg twice daily, low-dose sibrafiban\/ticlopidine placebo twice daily, and high-dose sibrafiban\/ticlopidine placebo twice daily. After the second interim safety assessment by the Data and Safety Monitoring Board the stent regimen for the low-dose group was modified to include ticlopidine 250 mg twice daily.\nEND POINTS: The primary efficacy end point of SYMPHONY was the 90-day incidence of a composite of all-cause mortality, myocardial infarction or reinfarction, and severe recurrent ischemia. A clinical events classification committee was established to determine the end points of reinfarction and severe recurrent ischemia. The primary safety end points were the incidence of major bleeding or minor bleeding and the combined incidence of major and minor bleeding. Bleeding classification was done by computer algorithm. Tolerability was assessed by the rate of study drug discontinuation from bleeding.",

This article critically evaluates the literature and generates evidence-based recommendations for the management of idiopathic MPGN. For all age groups, for idiopathic MPGN with normal renal function and asymptomatic nonnephrotic range proteinuria, no specific therapy is necessary (grades B and C). Close follow-up every three to four months, with specific attention to renal function, proteinuria, and blood pressure control, is recommended. In children with MPGN and nephrotic syndrome and\/or impaired renal function, a trial of steroids is warranted (grade A). The best data suggest high-dose, alternate-day steroids for a period of 6 to 12 months (40 mg\/m2 on alternate days). If no benefit is seen, discontinuation with close follow-up and attention to conservative treatment (that is, blood pressure control, use of agents to reduce proteinuria, and correction of metabolic abnormalities) is recommended. In adults with MPGN, impaired renal function, and\/or nephrotic-range proteinuria, a trial of aspirin (325 mg daily), dipyridamole (75 to 100 mg tid), or a combination of the two for 12 months is reasonable (grade B). Again, if no benefits are seen, the treatment should be stopped. Attention to factors known to delay the progression of renal decline and close follow-up should be part of the treatment plan (grades B and C).",

        "Abstract":"BACKGROUND: Bartter's syndrome (BS) is an inherited disease of renal potassium wasting characterized by hypokalemic alkalosis, normal blood pressure, vascular insensitivity to pressor agents and elevated plasma concentrations of renin and aldosterone. It is caused by generalized hyperplasia of the juxtaglomerular apparatus at the site of renin production caused by mutations in the Na-K-2Cl cotransporter gene, NKCC2. The objective of our study is to establish the prevalence and incidence of BS in Kuwait and to assess treatment modalities for it.\nMETHODS AND RESULTS: Bartter's syndrome was diagnosed in 13 Kuwaiti children over a 14 year period (1981-1995) with the estimated incidence of 1.7\/100,000 live births. The mean age at diagnosis was 9.3 months (range 2-32 months). There were five males and eight females (ratio 1:1.6). The mean duration of follow up was 5.6 years (1-14 years). Both consanguinity and familial history among our patients were high (69 and 54%, respectively). All patients had hypokalemia, hypochloremia with metabolic alkalosis, hyperreninemia and were normotensive. Clinical presentation was essentially similar to that in other series. Eleven patients (85%) had growth failure, two had nephrocalcinosis (15%) and one had renal failure. All patients were treated with supplemental potassium, an aldosterone antagonist (spironolactone) and a prostaglandin synthetase inhibitor (indomethacin or aspirin) sequentially. Significant catch-up of growth (four patients) and increases in serum potassium (eight patients) were recorded after administration of indomethacin therapy. One patient died of severe pneumonia with respiratory failure from hypokalemic myopathy. Clinical presentation, inheritance, complications and therapy of BS are briefly discussed.\nCONCLUSION: Bartter's syndrome is a rare disease, but should be considered in the differential diagnosis of other disorders with growth failure and\/or hypokalemia. Early diagnosis, close follow up and compliance with treatment may lead to appropriate growth and development.",

        "Abstract":"The interaction of pregnancy and the rheumatic diseases varies, ranging from life-threatening conditions such as thromboembolic events and progressive renal disease in some autoimmune disorders, to minor flares of peripheral arthritis in inflammatory rheumatic disease. As a consequence, treatment strategy will vary according to the maternal or fetal compromise expected. All nonsteroidal anti-inflammatory drugs (NSAIDs), including high dose aspirin (acetylsalicylic acid), can cause adverse effects during pregnancy related to the inhibition of prostaglandin synthesis. Prolongation of gestation and labour, constriction of the ductus arteriosus, persistent fetal circulation, impairment of renal function and bleeding are risks of third trimester exposure of pregnant women to all inhibitors of cyclo-oxygenase. Most of these adverse effects can be prevented by discontinuing NSAIDs 8 weeks prior to delivery. Low dose aspirin has not been associated with fetal or neonatal toxicity. Some corticosteroids such as prednisone and prednisolone do not readily cross the placenta and can be safely used during pregnancy as immunosuppressive drugs. Maternal complications related to corticosteroids may occur and close monitoring is therefore mandatory. There is limited information on the safety of disease-modifying antirheumatic drugs including gold, antimalarials, penicillamine (D-penicillamine), sulfasalazine and cyclosporin. Of these agents, sulfasalazine has the best record for tolerability and can be used by pregnant patients. Gold compounds and penicillamine should be discontinued when pregnancy is recognised. Hydroxychloroquine has not been associated with congenital malformations and seems preferable to chloroquine in patients requiring treatment with antimalarials. Use of cyclosporin may be an alternative to other therapy in pregnant patients with severe rheumatic disease. Indications for treatment with colchicine during pregnancy are few, except for familial Mediterranean fever. Azathioprine can be used when the maternal condition requires a cytotoxic drug during the first trimester. Cyclophosphamide, chlorambucil and methotrexate are contraindicated during pregnancy because of their teratogenic potential. Their use may be considered in late pregnancy if the mother has a life-threatening condition.",

        "Abstract":"We have reviewed 31 patients with Takayasu's arteritis followed at two pediatric nephrology units in Gauteng, South Africa over a 15-year period. There were 25 black patients, 4 white, and 2 of mixed race. The mean age at diagnosis was 8.42+\/-3.59 (range 2.4-14.5, median 8) years. The most common presenting sign was hypertension, followed by cardiac failure, bruits, and absent pulses. The Mantoux test was strongly positive in 27 patients (90%, control population 5%). Markers of activity included a raised erythrocyte sedimentation rate (23 patients) or Gallium single photon emission tomography (positive in 12 of 16 patients). Angiography revealed type II (abdominal aorta) and III (arch plus abdominal aorta) lesions to be most common (11 in each group). All patients received antituberculous therapy and most low-dose aspirin for its antithromboxane effect. Corticosteroids and further immunosuppression were used to control disease activity. We added total lymphoid irradiation (TLI) or cyclophosphamide. Twenty-six patients in all received further immunosuppression, with 13 patients in each group. Results were similar in the two groups, with similar pre- and posttherapy systolic blood pressures and creatinine clearances. Two patients in each group relapsed, 3 died in the TLI group and 2 in the cyclophosphamide group. Surgical intervention, usually in the quiescent phase, consisted mainly of renal autotransplantation. Because of the problems with TLI and 2 patients with papillary carcinoma of the thyroid with long-term follow-up, we no longer use TLI. We have shown that with active medical and surgical intervention the aggressive course of this disease in children can be modified.",

        "Abstract":"UNLABELLED: The most common combined pathogenetic treatment regimens for the treatment of chronic glomerulonephritis are the object of the present study. It is not quite uncommon in everyday clinical practice for the physician to encounter patients with similar pathohistologic patterns who respond differently to a standard therapeutic schedule.\nMETHODS: Having in mind the complexity of the problem we analyzed our ten-year experience with the combined pathogenetic treatment of 150 patients, aged 17 to 52, with histologically proven chronic glomerulonephritis. The diagnosis was made on the basis of light microscopy, immunofluorescent and, where available, electron microscopy studies of kidney biopsies using clinical and laboratory criteria. In most cases the combined pathogenetic treatment included standard dosage regimens consisting of corticosteroids--Prednisolone in a dose of 1.0-1.5 mg\/kg, cytotoxic agents--Cyclophosphamide 1.0-1.5 mg\/kg, anticoagulants--heparin (Calciparin) given for one month and antiplatelet drugs--Dipyridamole 300 mg\/day. When the preceding regimen was unsuccessful the patients were given pulse therapy with Methylprednisolone 10-15 mg\/kg on three successive days or Cyclophosphamide 10 mg\/kg in a single dose. Those who failed to respond to the standard pathogenetic and pulse therapy were treated with Cyclosporin (Sandimmun-Sandoz) in a daily dose of 2-5 mg\/kg. Complete remission occurred in forty-two patients (63.6%) with mesangial proliferative glomerulonephritis and 18 patients (60%) with membranous glomerulonephritis. The remaining patients were non-responders.\nRESULTS: The highest percentage of patients with complete remission was observed among those with minimal-change glomerulonephritis--20 patients (95.2%) and the lowest--among those with mesangiocapillary glomerulonephritis--5 patients (27.7%), focal segmental glomerular sclerosis and hyalinosis and sclerosing glomerulonephritis--11.1% and 16.7%, respectively.\nCONCLUSIONS: The authors think that at present the combined pathogenetic treatment of chronic glomerulonephritis has no alternative and can slow the progression of the renal injury as well as influence favorably the short- and long-term prognosis of the patient with glomerulonephritis.",

        "Abstract":"The 5-aminosalicylic acid (5-ASA) is currently the treatment of choice for patients with inflammatory bowel disease. It can be administered as sulfasalazine (5-ASA + sulfapyridine), mesalazine (5-ASA + resins or gels) and olsalazine (two molecules of 5-ASA). The recent trend has been to use formulations without sulfapyridine since they produce less side-effects although some cases of nephrotoxicity have been described. We report the case of a young female with Crohn's disease treated with mesalazine (400 mg every 8 hours) over a period of 12 months who developed acute interstitial nephritis. The characteristic features of renal function impairment were an insidious onset with non-specific laboratory data and progression towards a chronic state which partially improved with steroid treatment. In summary, it is important to bear this possibility in mind when confronted by any renal impairment which cannot be related to a relapse of inflammatory bowel disease. Renal function should be monitored routinely in patients receiving mesalazine at least during the first year of treatment and annually thereafter.",

        "Published":null,
        "Abstract":"In 1971, Vane showed that nonsteroid antiinflammatory drugs (NSAIDs) inhibited the biosynthesis of prostaglandins and proposed this as their mechanism of action. Much work around the world has followed. The aspirin-like drugs inhibit the binding of the prostaglandin substrate, arachidonic acid, to the active site of the enzyme. After characterization of the COX-1 enzyme in 1976, a second COX gene was discovered in 1991 encoding for the inducible COX-2. The constitutive isoform of COX, COX-1, has clear physiological functions. The inducible isoform, COX-2, is induced by pro-inflammatory stimuli in migratory cells and inflamed tissues. The range of activities of NSAIDs against COX-1 compared to COX-2 explains the variations in the side effects of NSAIDs at their antiinflammatory doses. Drugs which have the highest potency on COX-2 and less effect on COX-1 will have potent antiinflammatory activity with fewer side effects. All the results published so far support the hypothesis that the unwanted side effects of NSAIDs, such as damage to the gastric mucosa and kidneys, are due to their ability to inhibit COX-1, while their antiinflammatory (therapeutic effects) are due to inhibition of COX-2. Other roles for COX-2 inhibitors will surely be found in the next few years, for prostaglandin formation is under strong control in organs such as the kidney, lungs and uterus. COX-2 is also potently expressed in human colon cancer cells, and NSAIDs delay the progress of colon tumors possibly by causing apoptosis of the tumor cells. The risk of developing Alzheimer's disease, which may involve an inflammatory component, is lessened by chronic ingestion of NSAIDs. The new highly selective inhibitors of COX-2 will not only provide a means of delaying premature labor but will also lead to advances in cancer therapy and protection against Alzheimer's disease.",

        "Abstract":"BACKGROUND: Inhibitors of the platelet glycoprotein IIb\/IIIa receptor given intravenously have been shown to be effective in reducing ischemic complications after coronary angioplasty and in unstable angina, making this a promising new class of agents for the treatment and prevention of ischemic events in patients with acute coronary syndromes. Sibrafiban (Ro 48-3657) is an oral, peptidomimetic, selective antagonist of the glycoprotein IIb\/IIIa receptor.\nMETHODS AND RESULTS: The Thrombolysis in Myocardial Infarction (TIMI) 12 trial was a phase II, double-blind, dose-ranging trial designed to evaluate the pharmacokinetics (PK), pharmacodynamics (PD), safety, and tolerability of sibrafiban in 329 patients after acute coronary syndromes. In the PK\/PD cohort of TIMI 12, 106 patients were randomized to receive one of seven dosing regimens of sibrafiban, ranging from 5 mg daily to 10 mg twice daily for 28 days. In the safety cohort, 223 patients were randomized to one of four dose regimens of sibrafiban (ranging from 5 mg twice daily to 15 mg once daily) or aspirin for 28 days. High levels of platelet inhibition were achieved: mean peak values ranged from 47% to 97% inhibition of 20 micromol\/L ADP-induced platelet aggregation on day 28 across the seven doses. Twice-daily dosing provided more sustained platelet inhibition (mean inhibition, 36% to 86% on day 28), whereas platelet inhibition returned to baseline levels by 24 hours with once-daily dosing. Major hemorrhage occurred in 1.5% of patients treated with sibrafiban and in 1.9% of patients treated with aspirin. Protocol-defined \"minor\" bleeding, usually mucocutaneous, occurred in 0% to 32% of patients in the various sibrafiban groups and in none of the patients treated with aspirin. Minor bleeding was related to total daily dose (P=.002), once- versus twice-daily dosing (P<.0001), renal function (P<.0001), and presentation with unstable angina (P<.01).\nCONCLUSIONS: The oral glycoprotein IIb\/IIIa antagonist sibrafiban achieved effective, long-term platelet inhibition with a clear dose-response but at the expense of a relatively high incidence of minor bleeding. Oral IIb\/IIIa inhibition deserves further study as a new treatment strategy in patients after acute coronary syndromes.",

The patients were divided in 3 smaller groups, as follows: group 1--prescribed diclofenac, group 2--paduden and group 3--aspirin. Clinical features and laboratory findings were evaluated after: a 2 months trial, 4 months trial, 6 months trial, 2 years trial, 3 years trial and more than 5 years trial, from the beginning of the NSAIDs therapy. The results were the followings: within the first 12 weeks of therapy with NSAIDs a good response was obtained in 64% (group 1), 59% (group 2) and 53% (group 3) of the managed children, respectively; after 8 years of treatment for the children remained under medical observation in our clinic, the remission was obtained in 68% (diclofenac), 60% (paduden) and 64% (aspirin) of the patients on NSAIDs therapy. The incidence of side-effects in the groups treated with diclofenac and paduden has been present in a smaller percentage and less severe than in the aspirin's group. No child managed with diclofenac had major gastrointestinal, hepatic or renal reactions. These results highlight the superiority of diclofenac as a new drug over aspirin and paduden, in the treatment of JCA.",

        "Abstract":"We conducted a prospective study in order to determine planned pregnancy outcome in systemic lupus erythematosus followed in a tertiary referral centre. Pregnancy was authorized if disease was inactive on 20 mg\/day prednisone or less for at least 1 yr. Upon the diagnosis of pregnancy, systematic corticosteroids consisting of 10 mg\/day prednisone or more were started. In the case of antiphospholipid antibodies, 100 mg\/day aspirin was added, replaced by heparin in the pre-partum period. In the case of antiphospholipid syndrome complicated by previous thrombotic events or fetal losses despite aspirin, heparin was prescribed. One woman with a history of atrioventricular block was treated with dexamethasone. Patients were monitored by medical and obstetrical examination, and laboratory tests carried out at least monthly and a quarterly echography. Among 62 pregnancies in 38 women, lupus flare was observed in 27% of the cases, 6% of which occurred in the post-partum period. Flares were moderate except in one renal involvement in a woman with prior diffuse proliferative glomerulonephritis. Therapy was not modified in half of the cases. Pregnancy ended in early spontaneous abortion not related to lupus flare (n = 10), stillbirth (n = 2). induced abortion (n = 2), preterm birth (n = 29) and full-term birth (n = 19). Caesarean section was performed in nine cases. A severe infection occurred in two premature neonates. Another premature neonate was growth retarded. Two children had cutaneous neonatal lupus. No child died, neither had atrioventricular block. Stillbirth and severe prematurity were more common in mothers with antiphospholipid syndrome. After exclusion of early spontaneous and induced abortions, the live birth rate was 96%, that is close to the French general population. The main problem remains a high rate of prematurity, but without maternal or neonatal death.",

        "Published":null,
        "Abstract":"Nonsteroid antiinflammatory drugs (NSAIDs) or aspirin-like drugs act by inhibiting the activity of the cyclooxygenase (COX) enzyme. Two isoforms of COX exist, COX-1, which is constitutively expressed, and COX-2, which is an inducible isoform. Prostaglandins synthesized by the constitutively expressed COX-1 are implicated in the maintenance of normal physiological function and have a 'cytoprotective' action in the stomach. COX-2 expression is normally low but is induced by inflammatory stimuli and cytokines. It is thought that the antiinflammatory actions of NSAIDs are caused by the inhibition of COX-2, whereas the unwanted side effects, such as gastrointestinal and renal toxicity, are caused by the inhibition of the constitutively expressed COX-1. Individual NSAIDs show different selectivities against the COX-1 and COX-2 isoforms. NSAIDs that are selective towards COX-2, such as meloxicam, may have an improved side-effect profile over current NSAIDs. In addition to their use as antiinflammatory agents in the treatment of rheumatoid arthritis and osteoarthritis, selective COX-2 inhibitors may also be beneficial in inhibiting colorectal tumor cell growth and in delaying premature labor.",

        "Abstract":"OBJECTIVES: The choice between sulfasalazine and 5-aminosalicylate (5-ASA) drugs in the management of patients with ulcerative colitis often depends on idiosyncrasies of drug tolerance and control of the disease in individual patients. We sought to evaluate whether there were population differences in the effect of 5-ASA and sulfasalazine on the occurrence of clinically recognized adverse events. We also attempted to determine whether there were differences in the use of concomitant steroids and in the rates of hospitalization.\nMETHODS: We reviewed a large computerized database drawn from general practices in the United Kingdom. There we found records of 2894 patients in whom general practitioners had diagnosed ulcerative colitis, and who were receiving ongoing medical therapy specific to ulcerative colitis. The period of data availability ran from the beginning of 1990 to the latter part of 1993. The average duration of observation was 2.1 yr per patient. Patient histories were categorized into distinct periods according to the dose of 5-ASAs and sulfasalazine, steroids, and immunosuppressants, and were further separated according to the activity of ulcerative colitis. Within these categories, we examined the initiation and discontinuation of steroids, incidence of new hospitalizations for ulcerative colitis, and clinical mention of adverse events.\nRESULTS: New clinical mentions of hepatic, pancreatic, renal, and hematological events other than anemia were similar among the 5-ASAs and were very infrequent overall. Hospitalizations for ulcerative colitis occurred with similar frequency (about 15 hospitalizations per 100 patients per year) among users of those drugs. Patients receiving sulfasalazine had lower rates of initiation of prednisolone than did patients receiving 5-ASA, but sulfasalazine was used proportionately less often in patients who had been recently hospitalized, and it may be that sulfasalazine patients were somewhat less sick, overall, than were 5-ASA-using patients. The choice of drug did not affect discontinuation rates for prednisolone among established users.\nCONCLUSIONS: In the United Kingdom, during the period of this study, serious adverse reactions to drugs were not an important aspect of the management of patients with ulcerative colitis. Renal and pancreatic complications of sulfasalazine and 5-ASA therapy were extremely rare. Sulfasalazine and 5-ASA drugs have similar steroid-sparing properties. Disease-specific hospitalizations are approximately 100 times more common in ulcerative colitis patients than are serious adverse drug effects. Considerations of drug efficacy should therefore dominate the choice between therapeutic agents.",

        "Abstract":"In several childhood diseases which have the ensuing risk of infertility in adult life because of direct hypothalamic-pituitary-testicular axis involvement, or as a consequence of therapeutic toxicity, the role of antisperm antibodies (ASA) is rarely addressed. The aim of this study was to investigate the occurrence of ASA in a large prepubertal male population (aged 1.2-13 years) consisting of three groups: Group I, 52 patients affected by malignant diseases (lymphoblastic leukaemia, malignant lymphoma, or Wilm's tumour, n = 42), or by nephrotic syndrome (n = 10); Group II, 212 patients with either genital tract abnormalities (cryptorchidism, inguinal hernia, funicular torsion or hypospadias, n = 202), or cystic fibrosis (n = 10); Group III: 100 age-matched normal boys. Group I and II patients were investigated at diagnosis and during or after treatment (drug, radiation or surgical therapy). Group III was used as controls. ASA were detected in sera by the Tray Agglutination Test (TAT) and indirect IgG, IgA and IgM immunobead tests (iIBT). All normal boys were ASA-negative using both tests. Twenty-six out of the 264 patients (9.8%) in Groups I and II were ASA-positive: 23 (8.7%) patients had a positive TAT with a titre of 1:32 to 1:128, whilst 14 (5.3%) had IgG-ASA after iIBT. Eleven patients (4.1%) were ASA-positive in both tests. Of the 26 ASA-positive boys, 24 had genital tract abnormalities (cryptorchidism, testicular torsion, hypospadias) and two had leukaemia with testicular infiltration. Treatment did not modify antibody positivity. Our data confirm that ASA can occur in prepubertal boys, mostly among cases with urogenital pathology, but that it is rare among other cases. Therefore autoimmune reaction against spermatozoa is another factor that should be considered in the evaluation of several conditions in childhood involving reproductive tract alteration and potential impairment of the blood testis (Sertoli cell) barrier.",

        "Abstract":"OBJECTIVES: Previous uncontrolled studies have suggested an interaction between ticlopidine, a major antiplatelet agent, and cyclosporin in heart- and kidney-transplant recipients. The aims of this study were to examine in a randomised, double-blind fashion, the possible interaction between cyclosporin A and ticlopidine (250 mg per day) and the tolerability of this combination in heart-transplant recipients.\nMETHODS: Twenty heart-transplant recipients were randomised into either a treated or a placebo group. Blood samples were drawn for time-course evaluation of cyclosporin blood levels over a period of 12 h, following the morning intake of cyclosporin and, for platelet aggregation studies, before and after 14 days of ticlopidine administration. Twenty four-hour urine samples were collected for 6-beta-hydroxycortisol measurements, before and after 14 days of ticlopidine.\nRESULTS: Although given at half the recommended daily dosage, ticlopidine significantly reduced platelet aggregation. Pharmacokinetic parameters indicate that the bioavailability of cyclosporin A was not significantly modified by ticlopidine. However, one patient in the ticlopidine group was withdrawn because of a major fall in cyclosporin blood level within 3 days of treatment. Urinary excretion of 6-beta-hydroxycortisol was augmented after treatment in the ticlopidine group compared with the placebo group, suggesting that induction of drug metabolism might have occurred. Data also show quite a large intra-individual variability in cyclosporin bioavailability in the placebo group, suggesting that poor absorption of the drug formulation and\/or poor compliance might have contributed to the decreased cyclosporin blood levels in the patient withdrawn from this study and in previous uncontrolled studies.\nCONCLUSION: Cyclosporin bioavailability was not clearly modified by a half dosage of ticlopidine in this study. We, however, recommend closely monitoring cyclosporin blood levels when prescribing ticlopidine. Further studies will be needed with new formulations of cyclosporin or when using the full dosage of ticlopidine.",

As the primary mechanism of action of oral isotretinoin is suppression of sebaceous gland activity, mucocutaneous side effects such as dry lips, nasal passages and eyes are predictable. Pretreatment counseling and concomitant use of moisturizing agents usually manage these side effects effectively; in unusual cases of particularly poor tolerability, dose adjustments suffice. Severe side effects are rare, the most common being aches and pains requiring no therapy, aspirin or paracetamol. As with other retinoids, reliable contraception is mandatory for women of childbearing potential. Acne patients with serious concomitant systemic disease, such as insulin-dependent diabetes, epilepsy or spina bifida, transplant patients, patients with renal failure, multiple sclerosis motor neuron disease and other can also safe be treated with a standard cumulative dose of 120 mg\/kg per treatment course.",

        "Abstract":"OBJECTIVES: To assess the prevalence of abnormal electrocardiograms (ECG) recorded routinely in patients undergoing elective surgery as well as the prevalence of ECG abnormalities that could not be predicted by the patient's medical history. To determine the influence of ECG results on patient care. To identify patient groups at high risk for abnormal ECG.\nPATIENTS AND METHODS: Retrospective study of 2,146 patients scheduled for non cardio-thoracic surgery requiring anesthesia. Two physicians reviewed the preoperative ECG reports in consultation with a cardiologist. The reports were considered normal, abnormal but expected or abnormal and unexpected based on agreement or not with the patient's medical history.\nRESULTS: The 161 (7.4%) patients for whom data was missing were excluded. Preoperative ECGs were performed in 1,898 (95.6%) cases. Abnormal ECG results were reported for 351 (18.5%), most often for men, patients over 45 years of age, those classified ASA III-V, those with cardiovascular disease, kidney failure and diabetes mellitus. Two hundred seventy unexpected abnormalities were found in 234 (12.3%) patients. Of these, 117 (43.3%) were considered major. The unexpected abnormalities motivated changes of attitude toward 4 (1.7%) patients, but new treatment was established for only 2 (0.8%) of them. The prevalence of unexpected abnormalities was higher in men, patients over 45 years of age and those classified as ASA III-V.\nCONCLUSIONS: The prevalence of unexpected preoperative ECG abnormalities among non cardio-thoracic surgical patients is high but the influence of such results is minimal. The sensitivity and specificity of preoperative ECG for detecting electrocardiographic abnormalities are low. We suggest that performance of ECG before surgery is useful in patients over 45 years of age or in those with cardiovascular disease, chronic kidney failure, diabetes mellitus, physical state ASA III-V and those for whom it has not been possible to obtain an adequate medical history or perform a complete physical.",

        "Abstract":"OBJECTIVE: To compare the systemic load of 5-aminosalicylic acid (5-ASA) as a basis for potential long-term toxicity during treatment in usual dosage with olsalazine (Dipentum) and one controlled-release mesalazine preparation (Salofalk) in patients with inactive ulcerative colitis.\nDESIGN: Open, randomized, crossover study. TREATMENT SCHEDULE: Olsalazine 500 mg twice daily for 7 days and mesalazine 500 mg thrice daily for 7 days consecutively.\nPATIENTS: Fifteen patients (12 males\/3 females) aged between 18-70 years with ulcerative colitis in endoscopically confirmed remission for at least one month.\nMETHODS: A morning predose plasma sample and a 24-h urine collection on days 6 and 7 of each course were obtained from all patients for quantitative determination of 5-ASA and acetyl-5-ASA (Ac-5-ASA) concentrations. High performance liquid chromatography was used and all analyses were performed blindly on coded samples.\nRESULTS: Treatment with mesalazine compared with olsalazine gave significantly higher levels of 5-ASA and Ac-5-ASA in plasma and urine. Maximum values and ranges of all variables were higher in the mesalazine group than in the olsalazine group. It is noteworthy that there was clear discriminance in the range of urine 5-ASA and Ac-5-ASA concentrations after mesalazine and olsalazine treatment.\nCONCLUSION: 1. The mesalazine preparation used, in comparison with olsalazine given in usual dosages, causes significantly higher levels of 5-ASA and Ac-5-ASA in plasma and urine in patients with inactive ulcerative colitis. 2. The lower systemic load of 5-ASA may reduce the potential risk of adverse events and in particular of nephrotoxicity.",

        "Published":null,
        "Abstract":"Ibuprofen is a non-steroidal anti-inflammatory drug, available over the counter in most countries at analysis doses (600-1200 mg\/day). After several years of such use, it would seem worthwhile to review recent safety data for this drug compared to reference analgesics. Spontaneous reporting to drug surveillance systems suggests one adverse reaction for every 5 million (UK) to 25 million (USA) 200 mg tablets sold, with one reported fatality for 0.6 to 23 billion tablets sold. During clinical and post-marketing studies, the frequency of adverse events was similar to that found with placebo or paracetamol. In a meta-analysis involving 46000 patients, the incidence of digestive events was 5 per cent, with 0.02 per cent upper GI bleeds. A prospective trial in 84000 children reported 0.007 per cent GI bleeds. Case-control studies of upper GI bleeding found odds ratios of the association with ibuprofen between 1 and 3, lower than those associated with aspirin, even at the low 'cardiovascular' doses. Other risks, such as the risk of renal failure, appear equally low. In the case of voluntary overdose, there appear to be little renal or other risk for ingested quantities below 6 g (30 tablets). Less than 1 per cent of the intoxications are rated as severe, and there have been even fewer fatalities. The favourable safety profile of ibuprofen may be related to short term use of low doses in otherwise healthy young patients, associated to a short product half-life, and may be to specific product properties. The quality of patient information may also be an important safety factor. When the safety of the drug in overdose is considered, substitution of aspirin or paracetamol, by ibuprofen, may actually reduce overall risk for the population.",

        "Published":null,
        "Abstract":"Low-dose pulse methotrexate has emerged as one of the most frequently used slow-acting, symptom-modifying antirheumatic drugs in patients with rheumatoid arthritis (RA) because of its favourable risk-benefit profile. Methotrexate is a weak bicarboxylic acid structurally related to folic acid. The most widely used methods for the analysis of methotrexate are immunoassays, particularly fluorescence polarisation immunoassay. After oral administration, the drug is rapidly but incompletely absorbed. Since food does not significantly affect the bioavailability of oral methotrexate in adult patients, the drug may be taken regardless of meals. There is a marked interindividual variability in the extent of absorption of oral methotrexate. Conversely, the intraindividual variability is moderate even over a long time period. Intramuscular and subcutaneous injections of methotrexate result in comparable pharmacokinetics, suggesting that these routes of administration are interchangeable. A mean protein binding to serum albumin of 42 to 57% is usually reported. Again, the unbound fraction exhibits a large interindividual variability. The steady-state volume of distribution is approximately 1 L\/kg. Methotrexate distributes to extravascular compartments, including synovial fluid, and to different tissues, especially kidney, liver and joint tissues. Finally, the drug is transported into cells, mainly by a carrier-mediated active transport process. Methotrexate is partly oxidised by hepatic aldehyde oxidase to 7-hydroxymethotrexate. This main, circulating metabolite is over 90% bound to serum albumin. Both methotrexate and 7-hydroxy-methotrexate may be converted to polyglutamyl derivatives which are selectively retained in cells. Methotrexate is mainly excreted by the kidney as intact drug regardless of the route of administration. The drug is filtered by the glomeruli, and then undergoes both secretion and reabsorption processes within the tubule. These processes are differentially saturable, resulting in possible nonlinear elimination pharmacokinetics. The usually reported mean values for the elimination half-life and the total body clearance of methotrexate are 5 to 8 hours and 4.8 to 7.8 L\/h, respectively. A positive correlation between methotrexate clearance and creatinine clearance has been found by some authors. Finally, the pharmacokinetics of low-dose methotrexate appears to be highly variable and largely unpredictable even in patients with normal renal and hepatic function. Furthermore, studies in patients with juvenile rheumatoid arthritis provide evidence of age-dependent pharmacokinetics of the drug. These features must be considered when judging the individual clinical response to methotrexate therapy. Various drugs currently used in RA may interact with methotrexate. Aspirin might affect methotrexate disposition to a greater extent than other nonsteroidal anti-inflammatory drugs without causing greater toxicity. Corticosteroids do not interfere with the pharmacokinetics of methotrexate, whereas chloroquine may reduce the gastrointestinal absorption of the drug. Folates, especially folic acid, have been shown to reduce the adverse effects of methotrexate without compromising its efficacy in RA. Finally, both trimethoprim-sulfamethoxazole (cotrimoxazole) and probenecid lead to increased toxicity of methotrexate, and hence should be avoided in patients receiving these drugs. A relationship between oral dosage and efficacy has been found in the range 5 to 20mg methotrexate weekly. The plateau of efficacy is attained at approximately 10 mg\/m2\/week in most patients. No clear relationship between pharmacokinetic parameters and clinical response has been demonstrated. Overall, the dosage must be individualised because of interindividual variability in the dose-response curve. This variability is probably related, at least in part, to the wide interindividual variability in the disposition of the drug.",

        "Published":null,
        "Abstract":"OBJECTIVE: Mivacurium produces a prolonged neuromuscular block (NMB) in anuric patients (13), in spite of its rapid hydrolysis by pseudocholinesterase (PChE) which is independent of renal function (17). In the present study the pharmacodynamics and the cardiovascular effects of a bolus dose of mivacurium (0.15 mg\/kg) in relation to impairment of renal function were evaluated.\nMETHODS: 60 patients (ASA class 2-4) were assigned to one of three groups according to the degree of renal dysfunction. Creatinine clearance (Krea-Cl) as a measure of renal function was calculated using weight, age, sex and serum creatinine concentrations. Group C (control): Krea-Cl > 50 ml\/min; group P (preterminal): 20 ml\/min < Krea-Cl < 50 ml\/min; group T (terminal): Krea-Cl < 20 ml\/min. PChE activity and dibucaine numbers were assessed preoperatively. Neuromuscular transmission (Train-of-Four) was monitored using electromyography (Relaxograph, Datex Inc.) with stimulation of the ulnar nerve. The response was recorded from the hypothenar muscle. Five minutes after induction of anaesthesia with propofol and fentanyl, 0.15 mg\/kg mivacurium was given i.v. over 30 s. 150 s later patients were intubated. Anaesthesia was maintained by propofol (2-10 mg\/kg\/h) and fentanyl (0-5 micrograms\/kg\/h) infusion. Patients were ventilated with oxygen\/nitrous oxide (FiO2 = 0.35). As soon as T1 recovered to 5% or more, mivacurium was administered continuously and this part of the study was finished. Times of onset (onset 10; onsetmax), maximal neuromuscular block (NMBmax), neuromuscular block when intubation was started (NMBTubus), and duration 5% (dur 5) were calculated. Arterial blood pressure and heart rate were recorded before anaesthesia, after induction of anaesthesia, 2-times after mivacurium application, and after intubation. All data were compared using Kruskal-Wallis test corrected for multiple comparisons, Friedman test, or chi 2-test (*: p < 0.05). Logarithms of dur 5 and PChEd were correlated using linear regression.\nRESULTS: Demographic data were comparable between all groups. PChEd was 3.7 (3.0\/4.1) kU\/l in group C, 3.2 (2.2\/4.8) kU\/l in group P, and 3.5 (2.5\/4.0) kU\/l in group T, respectively. There were no differences between groups, neither in the NMBmax, in NMBTubus, or in onset times. But dur 5 was significantly longer in patients with renal impairment, both preterminal and also end-stage (medians: 11 min in group K, 16 min in group P, 17 min in group T). Emphasis, however, is put on the broad range between 5 and 47 min of dur 5 in group P, and between 6 and 53 min in patients of group T which is clinically more important than the differences in the median values. Dur 5 correlates with PChEd (p = 0.0001). Intubation conditions were excellent (relaxed vocal cords, easy passage of the tube, without coughing) in approximately 70% of all 59 patients without significant differences between groups. In 8 patients conditions were poor (successful intubation, inspite of moderately adducted vocal cords, but moderate coughing after passage of the endotracheal tube). There were no clinically relevant hemodynamic changes in each group in the time between injection of 0.15 mg\/kg mivacurium slowly and intubation 2.5 min later.\nDISCUSSION: Our findings suggest that 0.15 mg\/kg mivacurium is an effective and safe intubation dose in healthy patients as well as in patients with renal impairment, inspite of a prolonged duration in patients with renal impairment. Low PChE in some, but not in all patients with a renal dysfunction indicates involvement of impaired hepatic function. There was a close correlation between the PChEd and dur 5. Therefore mivacurium dosage should be reduced in patients with compromised renal function, mainly if there are additional systemic, especially hepatic diseases. Thus, in patients with impaired renal function, relaxometry may be of high valu",

        "Abstract":"We report our experience with the transperitoneal (TP) and retroperitoneal (RP) approaches for performing laparoscopic nephrectomy for benign disease. Thirty-three patients with benign renal disease underwent laparoscopic nephrectomy, 23 by the TP and 10 by the RP approach. The average age of the patient, ASA score, and specimen weight were similar for the two groups. The average operating time for the TP approach was 5.6 hours v 5 hours for the RP approach. The average hospital stay was 2.8 and 3 days for TP and RP groups, respectively. The use of postoperative analgesics was similar in the two groups (37 mg of morphine sulfate equivalent v 39 mg of morphine sulfate equivalent for the TP and RP groups, respectively). However, the RP group required less time to resume normal oral intake than the TP group (0.3 v 0.6 days). When assessed according to specimen weight of 100 or less, there was a significant reduction in the postoperative analgesia requirements for the RP group of patients (11 mg of morphine sulfate equivalent v 28 mg of morphine sulfate equivalent for the TP group). In this subgroup of patients, the resumption of oral intake also occurred more quickly in the RP than the TP group (0.4 v 0.5 days). The hospital stay and total convalescence time were similar for the two groups. Four complications occurred in the 33 patients: 2 patients (1 TP and 1 RP), required conversion to open surgery, 1 asthenic patient developed a vastus lateralis bruise undergoing a TP approach, and a brachial nerve palsy occurred in a morbidly obese patient who failed a TP approach. The RP approach to laparoscopic nephrectomy reduces the time to resuming normal oral intake for patients postoperatively and, in those patients with a small specimen, may significantly reduce their postoperative analgesia requirements. However, the RP approach for laparoscopic nephrectomy for benign disease does not significantly improve the length of hospital stay or the patient's ultimate postoperative return to normal activity in comparison to the TP approach. There does appear to be a trend toward a shorter operative time for the RP approach. The RP laparoscopic approach is our method of choice for patients with benign renal disease.",

The aim of the study was to compare (1) maintenance of anaesthesia and (2) how rapidly and easily the patients emerge from the anaesthetic and recover.\nMETHODS: Outpatients were included who underwent scheduled surgical procedures of an anticipated duration of up to 3 h and an anticipated length of hospitalization of less than 24 h post-anaesthesia. Five hundred patients were randomly selected to receive either sevoflurane (n = 247) or isoflurane (n = 253), each administered with oxygen (30-50%) in nitrous oxide. Efficacy was evaluated through the measurement of times of recovery parameters and tests like the objective pain-discomfort scale, the visual analogue scale, and the digit symbol substitution test. Safety was evaluated by monitoring adverse experience, clinical laboratory and non-laboratory testing and physical assessments.\nRESULTS: No statistical differences were observed between the two treatment groups with respect to demographics and ASA class. All study drug concentrations during each anaesthetic phase were statistically lower in the sevoflurane (average concentration 0.61 MAC) compared to the isoflurane (average concentration 0.70 MAC) group. The mean time to emergence was statistically shorter in the sevoflurane group (8.2 min) than in the isoflurane group (9.3 min). The mean time to response to commands (8.5 min vs 9.8 min) and the mean time to orientation (10.6 min vs 13.0 min) were also statistically shorter in the sevoflurane than in the isoflurane group. The EEG results showed a faster decrease in delta activity and a faster increase in alpha activity in the sevoflurane group than in the isoflurane group, indicating faster awakening. No statistical differences were observed between the two treatment groups for the mean time to any of the remaining post-anaesthesia events. Bradycardia was observed in a statistcally higher percentage of patients in the sevoflurane group (6%) than in the isoflurane group (2%). No other statistical differences were observed between the two treatment groups concerning the incidence of study drug-related adverse experience. The most common adverse experiences were nausea and vomiting. At all post-anaesthesia time points, higher serum inorganic fluoride concentrations were observed in the sevoflurane (maximum 30.2 mumol\/l) than in the isoflurane group. No clinical or laboratory renal insufficiency was noted. Eighty-seven percent of patients in the sevoflurane group would request the same anaesthetic technique compared to only 79% of patients in the isoflurane group.\nCONCLUSIONS: Sevoflurane was as safe as isoflurane for anaesthesia in adult outpatients. Patients who received sevoflurane had statistically significantly shorter recovery parameters than isoflurane patients.",

Clinical outcomes 5 years after the initiation of treatment in two centers were compared. In one center, patients were treated with tonsillectomy combined with steroid pulse, cyclophosphamide, anti-platelet drugs and warfarin (intensive therapy group, Group A, n = 50).

Five years after the initiation of treatment, proteinuria was remarkably reduced from 1.6 g\/day to 0.5 g\/day in Group A, whereas no significant change in proteinuria was observed in Group B. Creatinine clearance significantly improved from 77.6 ml\/mm to 89.4 ml\/min in Group A, whereas creatinine clearance deteriorated from 70.9 ml\/min to 62.5 ml\/min during 5 years in Group B.

At the moment halothane (H) is preferentially used for this purpose due to its non-irritating odor and the smoothness of anaesthetic action. However, experience is limited with the use of S in children, and concern exists about potential renal toxicity of its metabolite, i.e. fluoride. Therefore, we compared S and H in an open, randomized phase III trial.\nMATERIAL AND METHODS: With approval of the ethics committee and written informed parental consent, 40 children (age 1-10, mean 5.3 years, ASA class I and II) had anaesthesia induced without premedication (fresh gas flow 6 l\/min, N2O\/O2 = 65\/35). Concentration of volatile anaesthetics was increased every 3-5 breaths (S: 0.8...3.2 vol%, H: 0.4...1.6 Vol%). The ciliary reflex was tested until it disappeared. Airway reflexes and excitation were quantified using a score. Upon venipuncture, relaxation and intubation, anaesthesia was maintained with S (Fi: 2.4 vol%) or H (Fi: 1.2 vol%) in N2O\/O2 (3 l\/min, etCO2 35-38 mm HG). Alfentanil was supplemented in repeated doses of 20 micrograms\/kg. ECG, NIBP, SpO2, Fi and Fet of CO2 and volatile anaesthetics were continuously recorded. At the end of surgery anaesthetics were terminated abruptly and fresh gas flow was increased to 6 l\/min O2. Time to the first purposeful movement was registered. Serum fluoride levels were determined immediately after venipuncture, at the end of surgery and 70 min later. Time to possible discharge from the PACU was quantified using a modified Aldrete score. Data were analysed with descriptive methods, Student's t-test or non-parametric tests as appropriate.\nRESULTS: Groups did not differ with respect to age, weight, sex, or type of surgery. Total dose of anaesthetics was 1.60 MACxh for S and 1.77 MACxh for H (p = 0.68). Table 6 shows the essential data. Mean arterial blood pressures and heart rate remained within +\/- 20% of age-related normal values (Table 7). Mean serum fluoride level was 23.1 +\/- 1.2 mumol\/l at the end of surgery and decreased to 18.6 +\/- 0.970 min later (Fig. 3).\nCONCLUSIONS: Sevoflurane is an alternative to halothane in pediatric inhalational anaesthesia, with a comparable, low incidence of airway irritation and smoothness of induction. Because of the significantly faster induction and recovery it seems superior to halothane. With the fluoride levels measured, an impairment of renal function is unlikely.",

        "Abstract":"OBJECTIVE: To determine the value of low-dose aspirin in high-risk pregnancies, and assess its impact on fetal growth, as well as on perinatal mortality and morbidity.\nMETHODOLOGY: One hundred and eight women with singleton pregnancies were enrolled in a randomized, double-blind, placebo-controlled trial of 100 mg\/day aspirin from 17 to 19 week gestation. Enrolment criteria included pre-existing chronic essential hypertension or renal disease, or a history of previous early, severe pre-eclampsia.\nRESULTS: There were four stillbirths (all aspirin) and two neonatal deaths (both placebo), to yield respective perinatal mortality rates of 69\/1000 and 40\/1000 (P = 0.499). Liveborn infants in the aspirin group were significantly more mature (P = 0.017) and of heavier birthweight (P = 0.034) but had similar length (P = 0.091) and head circumference (P = 0.257). Fewer infants in the aspirin group were liveborn prematurely (5\/54 vs 14\/50; P = 0.016) or were of low birthweight (3\/54 vs 9\/50; P = 0.052). There were no significant between-group differences for standard deviation (Z) scores for weight, length or head circumference, or for skinfold thickness measurements. There was no significant difference in occurrence of low Apgar scores or in neonatal intensive care unit use between the groups.\nCONCLUSIONS: Low-dose aspirin does not appear to have a significant effect on perinatal morbidity. The increase in weight at birth associated with low-dose aspirin therapy is due to prolongation of pregnancy rather than prevention of intra-uterine growth retardation.",

Aspirin (ASA) is an alternative, but there are no controlled trials on its efficacy. We randomly assigned 75 premature infants suffering from respiratory distress syndrome (RDS) (mean gestational age: 29.6 +\/- 2.5 wk, mean birth weight: 1295 +\/- 464 g) (+\/- SD) and on artificial ventilation at the start of the study (mean: 3.4 d of life), to either Indo (3 x 0.2 mg\/kg\/12 h) or ASA (4 x 15 mg\/kg\/6 h). PDA and degree of shunting were evaluated by echocardio-Doppler; side effects were carefully recorded. PDA closed in 35\/38 patients from the Indo group (92%) and in 16\/37 patients from the ASA group (43%) (p < 0.0001). Nineteen patients needed further treatment with Indo or surgery (17 in the ASA group and 2 in the Indo group). The only side effect observed was a decrease of uresis in the Indo group during 4 d post treatment (p < 0.01). Closing of PDA was positively correlated with gestational age, but not with time of starting Indo\/ASA or grade of shunting. We conclude that ASA is not as effective in closing PDA as Indo, but has no adverse effect on uresis.",

        "Abstract":"The Diabetes Control and Complications Trial (DCCT), a multicenter, randomized, controlled clinical trial, demonstrated that intensive diabetes therapy delays the onset and slows the progression of retinopathy, nephropathy, and neuropathy in patients with insulin-dependent diabetes mellitus. This study presents the effect of intensive therapy on atherosclerosis-related events and associated risk factors. Patients (n = 1,441) between the ages of 13 and 39 years with insulin-dependent diabetes mellitus were randomly assigned to conventional or intensive diabetes treatment. The patients were free of cardiovascular disease at baseline. Patients with hypertension, hypercholesterolemia, or obesity were excluded. Average length of follow-up was 6.5 years (range 3.5 to 9). The study used standardized definitions of macrovascular events, verification of such events, and central laboratories for determination of lipids and the grading of electrocardiograms. The number of combined major macrovascular events was almost twice as high in the conventionally treated group (40 events) as in the intensive-treatment group (23 events), although the differences were not statistically significant (p = 0.08). There were no differences in the cumulative incidence of hypertension. Mean total serum cholesterol, calculated low-density lipoprotein cholesterol, and triglycerides were significantly reduced in the intensive-treatment group (p < or = 0.01), as was the development of low-density lipoprotein cholesterol levels > 160 mg\/dl. Weight gain was significantly increased in the intensive-treatment group (p < 0.001). There were no differences in cigarette smoking habits, consumption of alcohol, or aspirin use between treatment groups. The reduction in some, but not all, cardiovascular risk factors suggests a potential beneficial effect of intensive therapy on macrovascular disease in insulin-dependent diabetes mellitus.",

        "Abstract":"Flurbiprofen is a chiral nonsteroidal anti-inflammatory drug (NSAID) of the 2-arylpropionic acid class. Although it possesses a chiral centre, with the S-(+)-enantiomer possessing most of the beneficial anti-inflammatory activity, both enantiomers may possess analgesic activity and all flurbiprofen preparations to date are marketed as the racemate. Flurbiprofen exhibits stereoselectivity in its pharmacokinetics. Stereoselectivity is exhibited at the level of protein binding and metabolite formation. Hence, the data generated using nonstereoselective assays may not be used to explain the pharmacokinetics of individual enantiomers. The absorption of flurbiprofen is rapid and almost complete when given orally. The area under the plasma concentration-time curve of flurbiprofen is proportional to the dose administered to patients. Sustained release dosage forms are available, which may be beneficial due to the short terminal phase elimination half-life of conventional immediate release flurbiprofen (3 to 6 hours). They may also decrease local gastrointestinal adverse effects. Although with these preparations the peak plasma drug concentration is reduced and time taken to achieve peak concentrations is prolonged, the bioavailability is the same as that with regular release counterparts. Flurbiprofen binds extensively to plasma albumin, apparently in a stereoselective manner. Substantial concentrations of the drug are attained in synovial fluid, which is the proposed site of action of NSAIDs. There is negligible R to S inversion after oral administration. Flurbiprofen is eliminated following extensive biotransformation to glucuro-conjugated metabolites. Conjugates are excreted in urine, and approximately 20% of flurbiprofen is eliminated unchanged. The excretion of conjugates may be tied to renal function as accumulation of conjugates occurs in end-stage renal disease, but not in young individuals or elderly patients. Although flurbiprofen is excreted into breast milk, the amount of drug transferred comprises only a small fraction of the maternal exposure. Significant drug interactions have been demonstrated for aspirin (acetylsalicylic acid), coumarins and propranolol. The relationship between concentration and anti-inflammatory and analgesic effect has yet to be elucidated for this drug.",

Plasma and urine were assayed for the above drugs by high-performance liquid chromatographic method. Individual pharmacokinetic parameters were estimated by compartmental modeling (ASA and SA) and by model-independent methods (SUA). ASA parameter values estimated in this study were in agreement with those reported by other authors after administration of higher doses, which confirms the linearity of ASA pharmacokinetics in a broad dose range. On the contrary, both metabolic and renal elimination routes for SA were found to be saturable. The relative changes in SA renal clearance with the dose were more pronounced than those in metabolic clearance. Particularly, there was no statistically significant difference in SA metabolic clearance between 30 and 100 mg doses, indicating the linear kinetics in this dose range. Further increase in the dose resulted in significant decrease in SA metabolic clearance. At the same time, both SA excretion rate constant and fraction excreted significantly diminished across the entire dose range studied. The dependence of SUA renal clearance upon the dose was shown to be complex, reflecting possible saturability of its excretion.",

        "Abstract":"Patients with type II diabetes commonly die from thrombotic vascular disease. Large vessel occlusion due to thrombosis or atherosclerotic stenosis is a process accelerated by diabetes and results in premature death. Diabetic small vessel disease, with its unique microangiopathic process, underlies many of the large vessel changes as well as causing retinopathy and nephropathy. The microangiopathic changes produce a prothrombotic tendency that has been widely reported in type II diabetes. There is reduced endothelial cell production of prostacyclin and the activators of fibrinolysis, together with increased platelet reactivity. In addition, there is increased lipid peroxidation and oxidative stress due to excess free-radical activity and impaired antioxidant defenses particularly in the presence of microvascular disease. The development of many of these abnormalities is associated with poor long-term glycemic control. However, the changes are also seen in atherosclerosis in nondiabetic patients where the progression of the disease can be modified by antiplatelet agents and antioxidants. The process of vascular damage is accelerated by diabetes, often due to co-existing disease and aging, although it is not clear that improvement in long-term glycemic control by lowering blood glucose levels to near to the nondiabetic state reduces the development of small and large vessel disease. Although the biochemical mechanism underlying this observation remains uncertain, protein glycosylation and increased platelet reactivity are implicated and interrelated. Increased oxidative stress due to excess free-radical activity may be central to diabetic vascular disease as endothelial cell damage, lipoprotein oxidation, modification of both platelet reactivity and arachidonic acid cascade are all properties of free radicals and their reaction products lipid peroxides.(ABSTRACT TRUNCATED AT 250 WORDS)",

Five cases were subcutaneously administered with 7000 to 11000 units of heparin for 4 weeks. Ten cases were administered with 60 unit\/kg of LMWH by drip infusion for 4 weeks. Eleven cases were treated with prednisolone and all cases were treated with anti-platelet agent as well.

There were no remarkable changes in the renal functions of both groups. In one case, both heparin and LMWH brought about reduction of proteinuria. Therefore, LMWH reduced urinary protein excretion by the same mechanism as heparin. The LMWH has an advantage over heparin in that the former has less risk of causing bleeding. We conclude that heparin and LMWH reduce proteinuria in some patients with proliferative glomerulonephritis.

All patients had a full blood count (in EDTA) measured before starting r-HuEPO and at monthly intervals thereafter up to six months. Variables studied were haematocrit, platelet count, mean platelet volume (MPV) and platelet distribution width (PDW). Other groups of control patients were also studied--patients with chronic renal failure receiving dialysis but not r-HuEPO (n = 40) and a group of patients with normal renal function who were receiving aspirin (n = 30).\nRESULTS: There was a significant increase in mean haematocrit (p < 0.01) and in mean platelet volume (p < 0.001) over the six month period, but no change in either total platelet count or platelet distribution width in the patients with chronic renal failure receiving r-HuEPO. In contrast, both the control groups showed no significant change in MPV.\nCONCLUSIONS: The results suggest that r-HuEPO affects thrombopoiesis and may be part of a group of humoral factors contributing to megakaryocyte development and maturation.

When they do occur, the standard treatment is primary surgery; but this is often technically difficult.\nCASE REPORT: A 3 year-7-month-old girl was admitted because of an abdominal mass and signs of heart failure. Ultrasonography showed that this mass involved the right renal vein and the inferior vena cava including the right atrium. A CT scan showed no metastases. Echocardiography showed that the mass occupied two thirds of the right atrium and had blocked the tricuspid valve. The patient was given heparin (2 mg\/kg\/day), vincristine (1.5 mg\/m2 on day 1) and actinomycin D (15 micrograms\/kg on day 1 to 3). The heart failure disappeared and the abdominal mass decreased in volume. This improvement was confirmed by successive ultrasonographies. Chemotherapy was then completed and the patient was operated on six weeks later: right nephrectomy and removal of the cavoatrial tumoral thrombus. Pathological examination confirmed the nephroblastoma and the patient was given radiotherapy and chemotherapy for 28 weeks. She was also given aspirin for 17 weeks. Pulmonary metastases were detected 1 year after onset and were treated by a combination of surgery and chemotherapy. The patient is well 20 months after the onset of the disease.\nCONCLUSION: Preoperative chemotherapy seems to be effective in nephroblastoma extending to cardiac cavities; it allows subsequent surgery and facilitates postoperative radiotherapy.",

        "Abstract":"Nonsteroid antiinflammatory drugs interfere with the diuretic activity of furosemide, implying that this effect is at least partially dependent on renal prostaglandin synthesis. To investigate whether prostaglandin production could also modulate the bronchial antireactive activity of this diuretic drug, we investigated the effect of inhaled lysine acetylsalicylate (162 mg) and of furosemide (18 mg), alone and in combination, on the bronchial obstructive response to ultrasonically nebulized water in asthmatic patients. The study was also prompted by the conflicting results obtained in previous studies of oral nonsteroid antiinflammatory drugs. Fifteen asthmatic patients underwent bronchial challenge with a mist of ultrasonically nebulized distilled water at the same time of day on four occasions, 2-4 days apart, 15 min after premedication according to a double-blind, randomized protocol. After placebo, mean PD15 to water mist did not differ from a preliminary test (2.1 +\/- 0.2 and 2.5 +\/- 0.4 ml, M +\/- SE, respectively). After lysine acetylsalicylate, mean PD15 rose to 5.0 +\/- 0.7 ml (2.8 +\/- 0.6 times higher than placebo); after furosemide, to 9.0 +\/- 1.5 ml (4.4 +\/- 0.9 times over placebo); and after the two drugs in combination, to 32.2 +\/- 5.6 ml (16.3 +\/- 3.0 times higher than placebo). Similar results were obtained with inhaled indomethacin, whereas sodium salicylate had no effect. These data indicate that the bronchial antireactive activity of inhaled furosemide is greatly enhanced by inhaled lysine acetylsalicylate through a mechanism which probably involves inhibition of the local synthesis of prostaglandins, and could have therapeutic implications.",

        "Abstract":"STUDY OBJECTIVE: To measure the interaction of two antibiotics (clindamycin and colistin) on neuromuscular blockade induced by pipecuronium bromide (a new long-acting, steroidal, nondepolarizing neuromuscular blocking drug).\nDESIGN: Prospective, randomized, placebo-controlled study.\nSETTING: Inpatient gynecologic and gastroenterologic service at a university medical center.\nPATIENTS: Three groups of 20 ASA physical status I and II patients with normal kidney and liver function, taking no medication, and undergoing elective surgery under general anesthesia.\nINTERVENTIONS: Anesthesia was induced with propofol and alfentanil intravenously (IV) and maintained with a propofol infusion and 60% nitrous oxide in oxygen. Pipecuronium bromide 50 micrograms\/kg was administered after reaching a stable baseline of single-twitch response. At 25% recovery of pipecuronium-induced neuromuscular blockade, patients received one of two antibiotics, clindamycin 300 mg or colistin 1 million IU, or a placebo.\nMEASUREMENTS AND MAIN RESULTS: The recovery index (RI, defined as time from 25% to 75% recovery of neuromuscular blockade) was measured using the single-twitch response of the adductor pollicis muscle with supramaximal stimulation of the ulnar nerve at the wrist. RI after administration of an antibiotic (given at 25% recovery) was measured and compared with RI of the control group using Student's unpaired t-test. Statistical analyses of the results showed a significant prolongation of the recovery time (from 25% to 75% recovery) of 40 minutes for colistin.\nCONCLUSIONS: When this type of antibiotic is used during anesthesia with pipercuronium as a muscle relaxant, one must be aware of a significant prolongation of an already long-acting neuromuscular blockade and (although not observed in this study) possible problems in antagonism.",

We have assessed the efficacy of low-dose aspirin in women judged to be at moderate risk. Women were included on prophylactic criteria--age under 18 or over 40 years, mild or moderate chronic hypertension (diastolic pressure between 90 and 110 mm Hg), nephropathy with normal renal function and blood pressure, history of PIH or IUGR, and twin pregnancy--or therapeutic criteria--PIH or early signs of IUGR in current pregnancy. Eligible women were randomly assigned treatment with 50 mg aspirin daily until delivery (583) or no treatment (523); 18 and 46 women, respectively, were lost to follow-up. The groups were well matched for baseline characteristics. We found no differences between the no-treatment and aspirin groups in numbers of spontaneous (5 vs 2) or therapeutic (1 vs 2) abortions, stillbirths (14 vs 13), perinatal mortality (35.7 vs 28.6 per 1000 births), mean birthweight (2858 [SD 729] vs 2874 [795] g), proportion of infants with birthweights below the 10th centile (95 [18.3%] vs 117 [19.0%]), or births before 37 weeks' gestation (184 [35.6%] vs 209 [33.9%]). Nor did the groups differ in the frequency of PIH with or without proteinuria (51 [15.2%] vs 81 [19.3%]). There was no difference in mean birthweight between the treatment groups in separate analyses according to criteria for trial entry and week of gestation at randomisation. Our study gives little support to the notion that low-dose aspirin is beneficial in women at moderate risk of PIH or IUGR.",

        "Abstract":"The laryngeal mask airway (LMA) provides a patent airway when placed 'blindly' into the hypopharynx. At the laryngeal side it is supposed to form a seal surrounding the laryngeal inlet with the epiglottis lying outside the mask aperture. This study is designed to assess the prelaryngeal position of the mask by the fibreoptic technique. METHODS. After approval by the local ethical committee and informed consent, 100 adult patients (ASA groups I and II) undergoing general anaesthesia for extracorporal stroke wave lithotripsy (ESWL, Lithotripter HM 3, Dornier) of the kidney were studied. Anaesthesia was induced with propofol (1.5-2.5 mg.kg-1) and fentanyl (1-1.5 micrograms.kg-1) and maintained with isoflurane and N2O (65% in O2) as clinically indicated. The LMA was left in situ until the patients opened their mouth on command. Monitoring consisted of an ECG (SMV 104-D, Dornier), a pulse oximeter (Nellcor 200, Draeger), and a non-invasive blood pressure monitor (BP 103 N, Hoyer). Clinical assessment of airway patency and fibreoptic laryngoscopy (BF Typ 10, Olympus)--immediately and 20 min following the insertion of the LMA--were performed by two observers. RESULTS. The insertion of the LMA was successful on the first attempt in 89 patients while 5% required two, 4% three and 2% four attempts. 'Blindly' inserted without neuromuscular blockade the LMA provided a clinically sufficient airway in all patients. A central position of the LMA was assessed in only 59% of the cases. In 4 patients the mask was riding on the vocal folds. Positioned at the posterior larynx the cuff produced a compression of the laryngeal orifice when insufflated. Oblique insertion of the LMA or oblique head position during insertion produced a misplacement of the LMA. In 5 cases the LMA followed lateral movements of the head without losing its central position. In 87% the epiglottis was within the lumen of the LMA. Secretions inside the mask lumen or at the anatomic structures were seen in 36%. During manual ventilation with high inspiratory pressure (> 25 cm H2O) the oesophagus opened in 10 cases. CONCLUSIONS. Previous studies have suggested that the LMA takes a 'perfect' position at the laryngeal side when a clinically patent airway is recognized. In contrast, our results demonstrated that a central position of the LMA is achieved in only 59% of the cases. Our results indicate that epiglottic downfolding or left\/right side or anterior\/posterior misplacement are common but generally provide a satisfactory patent airway. This is consistent with fibreoptic findings in children and radiological observations in adults. The LMA is an essential enrichment to conventional airway management. It provides a better seal than the face mask, especially in bearded or in old patients where the facial contours are often not suited to the mask. Ideal indications seem to be elective operations of intermediate duration (1-2 h). The LMA does not protect against aspiration. For patients who are at risk of regurgitation of gastric contents, use of the LMA is absolutely contraindicated. Relative contraindications are local pathology of the pharynx and situations with low pulmonary compliance and\/or high airway resistance (massive obesity, asthma, etc.), especially during controlled ventilation. Further studies are necessary to establish definite indications for the application of the LMA.",

        "Abstract":"OBJECTIVES: This report presents information on the effects of aspirin on mortality, the occurrence of cardiovascular events, and the incidence of kidney disease in the patients enrolled in the Early Treatment Diabetic Retinopathy Study (ETDRS).\nSTUDY DESIGN: This multicenter, randomized clinical trial of aspirin vs placebo was sponsored by the National Eye Institute.\nPATIENTS: Patients (N = 3711) were enrolled in 22 clinical centers between April 1980 and July 1985. Men and women between the ages of 18 and 70 years with a clinical diagnosis of diabetes mellitus were eligible. Approximately 30% of all patients were considered to have type I diabetes mellitus, 31% type II, and in 39% type I or II could not be determined definitely.\nINTERVENTION: Patients were randomly assigned to aspirin or placebo (two 325-mg tablets once per day).\nMAIN OUTCOME MEASURES: Mortality from all causes was specified as the primary outcome measure for assessing the systemic effects of aspirin. Other outcome variables included cause-specific mortality and cardiovascular events.\nRESULTS: The estimate of relative risk for total mortality for aspirin-treated patients compared with placebo-treated patients for the entire study period was 0.91 (99% confidence interval, 0.75 to 1.11). Larger differences were noted for the occurrence of fatal and nonfatal myocardial infarction; the estimate of relative risk was 0.83 for the entire follow-up period (99% confidence interval, 0.66 to 1.04).\nCONCLUSIONS: The effects of aspirin on any of the cardiovascular events considered in the ETDRS were not substantially different from the effects observed in other studies that included mainly nondiabetic persons. Furthermore, there was no evidence of harmful effects of aspirin. Aspirin has been recommended previously for persons at risk for cardiovascular disease. The ETDRS results support application of this recommendation to those persons with diabetes at increased risk of cardiovascular disease.",

The types are similar in the frequency of hypocomplementemia and clinical course but are dissimilar in glomerular ultrastructure, pathogenesis, mechanisms of complement activation, predisposition to recur in the renal transplant, and, to some extent, in clinical presentation. Although glomerular proliferation is usually diffuse, it may be focal and segmental particularly in mild cases of MPGN I. Hypocomplementemia, present in about 80% of patients, is the result of hypercatabolism of C3 by three mechanisms as well as of diminished C3 synthesis. The hypocomplementemia is unrelated to clinical course or prognosis. Although MPGN I and III both have a high frequency of an extended haplotype on chromosome 6, which has known associations with autoimmune phenomena, and both have a high frequency of inherited complement defects, they are nevertheless dissimilar in glomerular ultrastructure, complement profile, and immunohistology in ways which suggest a wide difference in pathogenesis. Abnormalities in humoral immunity appear not to be involved in MPGN III.

After removal of the medication and treatment with hemofiltration and prednisone there was only an incomplete recovery of the renal function (creatinine-clearance 34 ml\/1,73 m2\/min). It is thought that an hyperergic-allergic reaction due to SASP and 5-ASA causes interstitial nephritis in inflammatory bowel disease (IBD). This reaction can be induced by re-exposition too. On the other hand IBD can be associated with glomerulonephritis. This could be a not very well known extraintestinal manifestation in IBD caused by immune-complexes in serum and glomerula. A rapid histological verification of the renal disease is necessary for successful treatment. In both renal manifestations chronic courses are possible. These observations should not lead to avoid SASP\/5-ASA in treatment of IBD, but renal function should be routinely investigated.",

        "Published":null,
        "Abstract":"Until recently, nonsteroidal anti-inflammatory drugs (NSAIDs) were regarded as weak analgesic agents with a potent antiplatelet effect that severely limited their perioperative usefulness. However, the recent development of injectable NSAIDs has stimulated a re-evaluation of the potential role of this class of drugs in postoperative pain management. In general surgery, NSAIDs have been shown to be effective analgesics when administered after surgery, as judged by either a reduction in pain scores and\/or by an opioid sparing effect. Parenteral NSAIDs alone, notably ketorolac and diclofenac, may be adequate or even preferred analgesic agents after minor surgery. In dental surgery, NSAIDs produce greater initial analgesia than steroids, although the latter produce greater suppression of swelling and less functional loss. NSAID pretreatment results in only modest suppression of swelling compared with placebo. These data suggest that the acute analgesic effects of NSAIDs in oral surgery and probably other models result from suppression of a nociceptive process, rather than a generalised anti-inflammatory effect. This view challenges the traditional association between inhibition of prostaglandin synthesis and the therapeutic effects of these drugs. The variety of NSAIDs leads to a range in half-lives from short, e.g. diclofenac (1 h), intermediate, e.g. ketorolac (5h), to long, e.g. tenoxicam (60h), which has implications for both convenience of the dosage regimen and drug accumulation. For some racemic NSAIDs (e.g. ibuprofen), metabolic 'activation' of the inactive R-enantiomer to the active S-enantiomer occurs. Renal dysfunction may increase both the plasma concentration and body residence time of NSAIDs, thereby increasing the risk of adverse effects. The concomitant effects of anaesthesia have not yet been studied. The principal concern regarding the use of perioperative NSAIDs is the risk of decreased haemostasis and wound healing. Although it has been found that NSAIDs prolong bleeding times in patients, values generally remain below the upper limits of those in generally healthy patients. Healing of gastrointestinal anastomoses may be compromised by NSAID administration but corneal healing and bone remodelling are not. There is a need for further research into the potential for renal side effects with NSAIDs in the perioperative setting, where the effects of anaesthesia and surgery may increase the risk of side effects, particularly in elderly patients. The main benefits of NSAIDs derive from opioid sparing (e.g. reduction in perioperative nausea and vomiting and improvement in ventilation), although some studies allude to an enhanced quality of analgesia from the combination compared with either NSAID or opioid alone. The question of pre- vs postinjury treatment with NSAIDs remains unresolved.",

        "Abstract":"Pregnancies complicated by chronic hypertension are at increased risk for the development of superimposed preeclampsia, abruptio placentae, and poor perinatal outcome. The frequency of these complications is particularly increased in patients with severe hypertension and those with preexisting cardiovascular and renal disease. Such women should receive appropriate antihypertensive therapy and frequent evaluations of maternal and fetal well-being. In contrast, in patients with mild essential chronic hypertension, the maternal and perinatal benefits from antihypertensive medications are highly controversial. A review of the literature revealed two placebo-controlled studies, four trials comparing treatment versus no medication, and three comparisons of methyldopa and oxprenolol. In only one of these studies were subjects randomized in the first trimester. No differences in pregnancy outcome were found with the use of antihypertensive drugs. Evaluation of the woman with chronic hypertension who is considering pregnancy should begin before conception to establish the cause and severity of the hypertension. Appropriate management should include frequent evaluation of maternal and fetal well-being; antihypertensive medications may be useful in patients with severe disease as well as in those with target organ involvement.",

Similar to world figures there was a 14.3% incidence of therapeutic abortion, a 4.8% incidence of ectopic pregnancy, a 16.7% incidence of spontaneous abortion, a 23.8% incidence of prematurity, a 4.8% incidence of fetal death in utero (FDIU) and a 9.5% incidence of intrauterine growth retardation (IUGR). In patients with antiphospholipid antibodies the obstetric outcome was significantly worse. Pregnancies complicated by preexisting renal compromise all concluded with an adverse outcome to the conceptus. In light of the experiences at the Royal Women's Hospital and a review of the world literature, the need for a standardized approach to SLE in pregnancy and more importantly the need for a large, prospective randomized trial of low dose aspirin in these pregnancies is highlighted.",

        "Published":null,
        "Abstract":"Poisoning is a significant problem in the elderly. The majority of poisonings in older people are unintentional and may result from dementia and confusion, improper use of the product, improper storage or mistaken identities. Depression is also common in the elderly and suicide attempts are more likely to be successful in this age group. The elderly patient's recuperative abilities may be inadequate as a result of numerous factors including impaired hepatic or renal function as well as chronic disease processes. General management of poisoning in the elderly parallels management of younger adults, but it is especially important to ascertain underlying medical conditions and concurrent medications. In most poisonings, activated charcoal and cathartic are sufficient. Haemodialysis or haemoperfusion may be required at lower plasma drug concentrations in elderly patients. While the specific indications for antidotes are the same for all age groups, dosage alterations and precautions may need to be considered in the elderly. Drugs most often implicated in poisonings in the elderly include psychotherapeutic drugs, cardiovascular drugs, analgesics and anti-inflammatory drugs, oral hypoglycaemics and theophylline. Cardiovascular and neurological toxicities occur with overdoses of neuroleptic drugs and, more frequently and severely, with cyclic antidepressants. Patients with pre-existing cardiovascular disease are at particular risk of worsening ischaemic heart disease and congestive heart failure. Benzodiazepines only appear to produce significant toxicity during long term administration or in combination with other CNS depressants. Digoxin can cause both chronic and acute intoxication, most seriously cardiac toxicity including severe ventricular arrhythmias, second or third degree heart block or severe refractory hyperkalaemia. Immune Fab antibody is indicated for the management of digoxin toxicity, although patients dependent on the inotropic effect of digoxin may develop heart failure after digoxin Fab antibody administration. Nitrates can cause toxicity including headache, vomiting, hypotension and tachycardia from excessive sublingual, transdermal or intravenous doses. Conduction disturbances and hypotension occur with overdoses of antihypertensive drugs; these effects are mild with angiotensin converting enzyme (ACE) inhibitors, occasionally severe with beta-blockers and of significant concern with calcium channel antagonists. The elderly commonly use aspirin and other salicylates, are more likely to develop chronic intoxications to these agents, and are more susceptible to severe complications such as pulmonary oedema. Salicylate poisoning, recognition of which is often delayed, should be considered in elderly patients with neurological abnormalities or breathing difficulties, especially in the setting of acid-base abnormalities. The clinical effects of NSAID overdose are mild and usually involve the central nervous system and gastrointestinal tract.(ABSTRACT TRUNCATED AT 400 WORDS)",

        "Abstract":"The aetiology of pregnancy-induced hypertension (PIH) is at present unknown. Epidemiological data lead us to assume, that two main mechanisms could be responsible for the development of PIH. They are not well understood in their complexity, but result in the same pattern of signs and symptoms: Oedema, proteinuria and hypertension. 1. \"Goldblatt-Phenomenon\" in the uterus, as a result of a disturbed maternal immune response to the cytotrophoblast, followed by the reduction of uterine blood flow and the liberation of vasoactive substances from the placenta. 2. Renal factors, especially in elderly women, result in a manifestation of nephrotic diseases during pregnancy. No screening methods are at the present time available to diagnose PIH in advance. It is therefore necessary, to look at typical clinical manifestations, i.e. the development of hypertension. It is also important to estimate the weight gain and the occurrence of oedema before rising blood pressure demonstrates a general vasoconstriction in the maternal vascular system. The basic therapeutical concept is to reduce the peripheral vascular resistance, to prevent maternal complications and to reduce the uterine vascular resistance to improve foetal oxygenation. In many cases an improvement of the oxygen supply to the foetus is not possible, since irreversible alterations of the uterine arterial vascular bed have already taken place. For the treatment of PIH, different drugs are available which act on different targets. In cases of special medical history, the early application of magnesium and acetyl salicylic acid (ASA) should be included in the therapeutical concept of prophylaxis.",

        "Abstract":"First the authors recall the synthesis cycles of prostaglandins and the main physiological effects of the latter. Taking into account these effects, antiprostaglandins can be used in two obstetrical pathologies: the threat of premature labour, the delayed intra-uterine development with or without toxaemia. In the particular case of the threat of premature labour, the authors report a certain number of clinical observations concerning non-steroidal anti-inflammatory drugs and namely indometacin, showing the efficacy of the treatment. They also evoke the complications of this therapy where the stenosis of the arterial canal and its repercussion on the renal function predominate. They conclude with some practical advice. In the particular case of delayed intra-uterine development with or without toxaemia, the authors put forward some physiopathological arguments leading to the use of the combination Aspirin\/Dipyridamole. They report the results of their personal experience. Out of 52 cases taking platelet aggregation inhibitors, 43 are linked with an obstetrical pathology and amongst them, 86 p. cent have a pathological past record (severe toxaemia, isolated DIUD, DIUD + toxaemia, IUFD). In the great majority of cases, treatment was administered before 20 WA. The pregnancy progressed normally in 76 p. cent of the cases and all the pathologies observed were minor. No serious complications have been reported. The average term of pregnancy is of 38 WA with an average growth weight of 2,920 g. The efficacy seems better if the past record is a DIUD rather than a toxaemia. The authors then compare their results with the literature data.(ABSTRACT TRUNCATED AT 250 WORDS)",

In all, 7\/64 (11%) of patients were at stage D of nephropathy at the end of follow-up. 2 of these began with IRA, 2 with nephritic syndrome, 2 with hypertension and one with monosymptomatic microhaematuria. The latter figure suggests that this symptom should not be underestimated at onset and its course should be followed closely. The mesangium was the primary localisation in the 6 patients biopsied.

        "Abstract":"Despite much research into the mechanisms of cutaneous aging and the identification of significant age-associated biological and biophysical changes within the skin, the question \"How does aging affect percutaneous absorption (PA) in vivo?\" remains unanswered. We have made in vivo measurements of PA in young (18-40 years) and old (greater than 65 years) subjects. Standard radiotracer methodology was employed and PA was quantified from the urinary excretion profiles of 14C radiolabel (corrected for incomplete renal elimination). Testosterone (TST), estradiol (EST), hydrocortisone (HC), benzoic acid (BA), acetylsalicylic acid (ASA), and caffeine (CAFF) have been studied. Permeation of HC, BA, ASA, and CAFF was significantly (p less than 0.01, 0.01, 0.01, and 0.05, respectively) lower in aged subjects, whereas the absorption of TST and EST was similar in the two groups. Thus it appears that aging can affect PA in vivo and that relatively hydrophilic compounds are particularly sensitive. The diminished surface lipid content of \"old\" skin implies a diminished dissolution medium for compounds administered topically. It is reasonable to speculate that this physiologic change will impact most severely upon those permeants whose lipid solubility is lowest (that is, HC, BA, ASA, CAFF). Furthermore, the typically reduced hydration of aged stratum corneum will compound this effect for these chemicals. Conversely, highly lipid-soluble chemicals (TST and EST) may still be able to dissolve readily into the stratum corneum even when the available lipid medium is reduced.",

        "Abstract":"Treatment of idiopathic membranoproliferative glomerulonephritis remains an unsettled issue. The results of five randomized clinical trials have not provided convincing evidence for the effectiveness of any treatment. Follow-up periods in these trials were relatively short-term, ranging from 1 to 4 years. In three recently published long-term clinical studies of patients with membranoproliferative glomerulonephritis, 10-year cumulative survival free of renal failure improved by 20% to 35% over that described in studies published 5 to 10 years earlier. In each study, survival was estimated using life-table analysis. The survival curve in the treated group was then compared with that of a historical control group using the date of clinical onset as time zero. The survival curve in the treatment group was spuriously shifted to the right. By definition, those in the treatment groups had to survive from clinical onset to initiation of treatment, but the historical control group did not have such a constraint. The problem in this comparison is that treatments were not started in a large number of patients for years after clinical onset, resulting in a biased comparison in favor of the treatment groups. (Also, the conclusions drawn from the survival data were that the improvement related directly to various treatments that were used.) Survival was similarly improved in patients treated with dipyridamole and aspirin when survival was plotted against time after clinical onset. However, when the data were replotted and the platelet-inhibitor-treated group was compared with a contemporary randomized control group, no difference in either patient survival or survival free of renal disease was demonstrated.(ABSTRACT TRUNCATED AT 250 WORDS)",

        "Abstract":"There is evidence that aspirin in low doses favorably influences the course of pregnancy-induced hypertension, but the mechanism, although assumed to involve suppression of the production of thromboxane by platelets, has not been established. We performed a randomized study of the effect of the long-term daily administration of 60 mg of aspirin (n = 17) or placebo (n = 16) on platelet thromboxane A2 and vascular prostacyclin in women at risk for pregnancy-induced hypertension. Low doses of aspirin were associated with a longer pregnancy and increased weight of newborns. Serum levels of thromboxane B2, a stable product of thromboxane A2, were almost completely (greater than 90 percent) inhibited by low doses of aspirin. The urinary excretion of immunoreactive thromboxane B2 was significantly reduced without changes in the level of 6-keto-prostaglandin F1 alpha, a product of prostacyclin. Mass spectrometric analysis showed that aspirin reduced the excretion of the 2,3-dinor-thromboxane B2 metabolite--mainly of platelet origin--by 81 percent and of thromboxane B2, probably chiefly of renal origin, by 59 percent. The urinary excretion of 6-keto-prostaglandin F1 alpha and of its metabolite 2,3-dinor-6-keto-prostaglandin F1 alpha was not affected. Low doses of aspirin only partially (63 percent) reduced neonatal serum thromboxane B2. No hemorrhagic complications were observed in the newborns. Thus, in women at risk for pregnancy-induced hypertension, low doses of aspirin selectively suppressed maternal platelet thromboxane B2 while sparing vascular prostacyclin, but only partially suppressed neonatal platelet thromboxane B2, allowing hemostatic competence in the fetus and newborn.",

In a randomized, double-blind, crossover study, 10 patients with biopsy-proved lupus nephritis were given a 48-hour continuous infusion of BM 13,177 or placebo. At base line, seven patients had markedly elevated urinary levels of thromboxane B2, the breakdown product of thromboxane A2. During the infusion of BM 13,177, the inulin clearance rate, which was 68 ml per minute per 1.73 m2 of body-surface area at base line, increased by an average of 24 percent (range, 12 to 47 percent; P less than 0.01). Para-aminohippurate clearance was increased to the same extent, with no change in the filtration fraction. The bleeding time doubled, indicating an occupancy of platelet thromboxane receptors of more than 95 percent. The hemodynamic changes were associated with a significant increase in sodium excretion from 76 to 118 mmol per day (P less than 0.01) but with no change in arterial blood pressure. In another study, 10 additional patients with lupus nephritis were randomly assigned to receive either placebo or 20 mg of aspirin twice daily for four weeks. The aspirin regimen produced a selective, cumulative inhibition of platelet cyclooxygenase activity and a doubling of bleeding time. However, there was no change in the inulin clearance rate and no change in urinary levels of thromboxane B2 or 6-keto-prostaglandin F1 alpha, which are indicators of renal synthesis of thromboxane A2 and prostacyclin, respectively. We conclude that in lupus nephritis, impairment of renal function is at least in part mediated hemodynamically and is reversible with a thromboxane antagonist.

        "Published":null,
        "Abstract":"The pharmacology, clinical efficacy and safety of new alpha-adrenergic receptor antagonists for the treatment of hypertension was reviewed (Table XIV). Although all these agents block alpha 1 receptors, some of them have additional effects on histamine, serotonin, dopamine, and alpha 2 receptors. These other actions account for the differences in the side effect profiles observed, i.e., increased incidence of central nervous system side effects found with indoramin, ketanserin, and urapidil, as well as for some additional beneficial effects of ketanserin (i.e., antiplatelet aggregation activity). The magnitude of BP reduction observed with antagonists of alpha 1-adrenergic receptors is modest. In most studies, the degree of BP reduction is comparable to that of prazosin, but less than that achieved with thiazide diuretics, beta-receptor antagonists, or methyldopa. Studies on the comparative efficacy and safety of new alpha 1 antagonists with converting enzyme inhibitors or calcium-channel blockers are not available. In general, alpha 1 antagonists produce greater reductions in standing than in supine BP, an effect due to the venodilatory action of these drugs. New alpha 1 antagonists appear to have equal efficacy in black and white hypertensive individuals. Their comparative efficacy and safety in young vs elderly hypertensive individuals requires further investigation. No information about the possible development of tolerance during treatment with new alpha 1 blockers was encountered. The effects of alpha 1 antagonists on HR are variable and depend on how long after the oral dose the measurements were obtained. In most studies, no significant HR changes are noticed for readings obtained 24 hours post dose; whereas tachycardia has been observed at the time of peak hypotension. Since alpha 1 antagonist-induced tachycardia is most likely of reflex nature, i.e., mediated to an increase in sympathetic activity, the increased HR may be associated with increases in myocardial contractility and in myocardial oxygen consumption. Consequently, a 24-hour HR monitoring during treatment with alpha 1 antagonists should be required for evaluation of new agents. The hemodynamic, humoral, and hormonal effects of the newer alpha 1-receptor antagonists are comparable to those of prazosin. The most consistent finding is a reduction in total peripheral resistance associated with either no change or with only small increases in cardiac index. These agents have been shown either not to change or to increase renal blood flow.(ABSTRACT TRUNCATED AT 400 WORDS)",

These patients, termed as vascular fragility syndrome (VFS), were analyzed to further characterize their bleeding patterns. The pattern of bleeding manifestations was similar to that of patients with platelet dysfunction, such as mucocutaneous bleeding or excessive post-operative bleeding. In 16 patients, desmopressin (1-desamino-8-d-arginine vasopressin, DDAVP) was infused to control active bleeding or as a part of pre-surgical evaluation.

Side effects with DDAVP were transient and minor, i.e. facial flushing, or conjunctival erythema. These findings indicate that VFS with isolated prolongation of bleeding time is a frequently encountered bleeding disorder and that DDAVP is effective in achieving hemostasis for the management of acute bleeding and may be useful prior to surgical procedures.",

She had previously received aspirin and tolmetin sodium and had no complications. A renal biopsy showed a severe tubulointerstitial nephritis. Although her renal function improved somewhat with corticosteroid treatment, it worsened when the steroids were discontinued.

        "Abstract":"UNLABELLED: The narcotic agonist-antagonist nalbuphine is reported to act as a strong analgesic with only minor respiratory depressant side-effects. Even in the postoperative period, the pain-relieving properties of analgesic drugs are reported to continue if the respiratory side-effects are being antagonized by administering nalbuphine. It was the aim of this study to investigate the analgesic properties of nalbuphine as compared to those of fentanyl, in suppressing the hemodynamic responses due to endotracheal intubation and skin incision. Furthermore, we are interested in studying postoperative analgesia and respiratory depression after using the two drugs during anesthesia.\nPATIENTS AND METHODS: Forty-one patients undergoing general surgical procedures were randomly assigned to two groups in a double-blind study. The patients were between 18 and 70 years old and belonged to ASA classes I-III. Patients with chronic obstructive pulmonary disease, cerebral vascular disorders, hepatic or renal failure, or those treated with monoamine oxidase inhibitors and tricyclic antidepressants were excluded from the study, as were patients with a drug dependency. All patients were premedicated with 25-50 mg each promethazine and pethidine. Anesthesia was induced with either 60-70 mg nalbuphine or 0.3-0.35 mg fentanyl, 2 mg alcuronium, 0.01 mg\/kg flunitrazepam, and 1-2 mg\/kg thiopental. All patients were intubated following 1-2 mg\/kg succinylcholine. Five minutes following intubation they received another 30-40 mg nalbuphine or 0.15-0.2 mg fentanyl intravenously. Anesthesia was maintained with N2O:O2 2:1, alcuronium, and either nalbuphine or fentanyl and enflurane up to 1 vol.% or halothane up to 0.5 vol.%. Blood pressure, pulse rate, and arterial blood gases were measured at certain intervals.(ABSTRACT TRUNCATED AT 250 WORDS)",

        "Abstract":"Captopril (C) causes ARF in hypertensive patients with renal artery stenosis (RAS) with a single functioning kidney (SK). Retrospective studies in two patients showed that episodes of C-induced ARF were preceded by a rise in urinary Na+ excretion and a rapid decrease in body weight. These observations prompted us to investigate whether extracellular fluid volume depletion secondary to C-induced natriuresis can be responsible for ARF. Prospective studies were performed in four patients with RAS-SK treated with C. These studies have shown that: ARF is associated with negative Na+ balance and is corrected by salt replacement, even without interrupting C; ARF is preceded by a rise in urinary prostaglandin (PG) E2 and 6-keto-F1 alpha; ARF is prevented by either saline infusion or aspirin administration; ARF does not occur when the dose of C is not sufficient to raise PGs and urinary N + excretion. We conclude therefore that C-induced ARF in patients with RAS-SK can be secondary to salt depletion dependent on a raised secretion of PGs.",

        "Abstract":"Plasma atrial natriuretic peptide (ANP) levels were inappropriately elevated in Bartter's syndrome, in contrast with appropriately low levels in patients with Addison's disease and bulimia, with similar hyper-reninaemia and volume contraction. Inappropriate overproduction of ANP in Bartter's syndrome may be important in the pathophysiology. Prostaglandin inhibitors cause sodium retention and might be expected to increase ANP levels, based on their volume effects. Surprisingly, therefore, both indomethacin and aspirin lowered elevated levels of ANP in Bartter's syndrome to normal, indomethacin achieving this within 24 h. Single doses of indomethacin and aspirin also lowered plasma ANP levels in normal subjects. Saline infusion in Bartter's syndrome increased already-elevated levels of ANP further. When repeated during indomethacin treatment, despite suppression of basal levels to normal, even higher levels were achieved in three of four subjects. These results are consistent with a role for prostaglandins in ANP release in man, but suggest that another mechanism is also operative. They may help to explain the variable renal effects of prostaglandin inhibition.",

Their age at onset was 5-13 years (mean 9.8 +\/- 2.1 years), less than that reported in recent years of children with lupus nephritis. All patients had clinical symptoms and signs and\/or laboratory findings of renal involvement. Renal biopsy, performed in all patients, showed: minimal change in 3 patients, mesangial glomerulonephritis in 5, focal proliferative glomerulonephritis in 3 and membranous glomerulonephritis in one patient. There was no correlation between age at onset and histological categories, while clinical data were well correlated with the degree of histological involvement. 11 patients were followed for 5.16 +\/- 3.2 years (range 1-13 years); 7 patients are in complete remission, 3 patients have only microscopic hematuria and\/or mild proteinuria, one patient died because of infection complicating pulmonary involvement. Our report confirms a more favorable evolution of lupus nephritis in children than in adults. In particular none of our patients whose disease started before the age of 10 years had poor outcome, in contrast to previous report describing a higher mortality and morbidity in younger children. The more favorable prognosis of our patients could depend not only on the absence of the more severe form of lupus nephritis that is diffuse proliferative glomerulonephritis, but also on the earlier diagnosis and subsequent therapy.",

The first step is preservation of forearm veins by avoiding unnecessary venipunctures in patients with chronic renal failure. Fistulas should be constructed well in advance of need and use natural rather than prosthetic veins whenever possible. Major surgery elsewhere is a potential cause of fistula thrombosis. Fistula construction is often best delayed till major surgery is over and until the veins have recovered from the effects of systemic steroid therapy. Avoidance of premature fistula cannulation and correct needling techniques help to prevent vein wall damage. Alertness to the presence of high venous pressures on dialysis and observation of inefficient dialysis due to recirculation should lead to detection of narrowed segments which can be surgically corrected before thrombosis occurs. Antiplatelet drugs are of proven value in the prevention of recurrent thrombotic episodes.",

Large doses of aspirin produced a comparable decrease in prostaglandin excretion but no improvement in any other metabolic abnormality thus suggesting that abnormalities in prostaglandins were the result rather than the cause of the electrolyte abnormalities. Progressive renal insufficiency while on indomethacin prompted a renal biopsy, which revealed morphological changes of focal, segmental glomerular sclerosis.

        "Abstract":"Diclofenac sodium was investigated in the treatment of juvenile rheumatoid arthritis (JRA). The pharmacokinetics of diclofenac in children aged 2-7 was assessed. Seven patients were included in a single-dose trial to determine plasma levels and renal elimination of diclofenac sodium. Venous blood samples were taken at 0, 0.5, 1, 2, 4 and 6 hours after administration of a 25 mg enteric-coated Voltaren tablet. Urine was collected before and 0-6 and 6-12 hours after tablet ingestion. Maximum concentrations ranged from 0.79 to 4.25 micrograms\/ml, and were found between 0.5 and 2 hours. Renal elimination of total diclofenac ranged from 5.4 to 10.2% of the oral dose in 6 of the 7 patients. The youngest patient (2 years) had a lower elimination rate (2.25%) during the 12 hours observed. The values for children over 2 years corresponded to the range measured in adults. The pharmacokinetic study was followed by a placebo-controlled study with diclofenac sodium and acetylsalicylic acid (ASA) for 2 weeks in 45 hospitalized patients aged 3-15 years. The patients were randomly assigned to either: DS 2-3 mg\/kg\/day, microcrystallized ASA 50-100 mg\/kg\/day, or placebo matching diclofenac. Global evaluation of therapeutic efficacy showed improvement in 73% of the patients in the diclofenac group, in 50% of the ASA group and in 27% of the placebo group. A statistically significant difference between these groups was found (p less than 0.05). The sum of grades of joint tenderness decreased during the 2 weeks in 67% of patients in the diclofenac group, in 56% of the ASA group and in 36% of the placebo group.(ABSTRACT TRUNCATED AT 250 WORDS)",

        "Abstract":"Eleven female patients with adult-onset Still's disease were followed for 7-36 years (mean 20.2 years) after the onset of their illness. Ten of these patients had a chronic course characterized by remissions and exacerbations of arthritis associated with fever and rash. Five patients had terminal interphalangeal involvement, and carpal ankylosis was demonstrated on x-ray film in 10. Two patients developed a widespread polyarthritis, and renal amyloidosis was diagnosed 10 years after disease onset in the most severely affected patient. In 4 patients studied during an exacerbation of the disease, circulating immune complexes were detected by the staphylococcal A binding assay, but not by the C1q binding assay. Synovial fluid analysis in 1 patient revealed a low C3 level and total hemolytic complement (CH50) together with immune complexes and IgG rheumatoid factor. Immune complexes were not identified in the characteristic Still's rash by immunofluorescence or electron microscopy, although mast cell degranulation, neutrophil lysis, and perivascular fibrin deposition were reminiscent of immune complex--mediated vascular injury. The clinical and laboratory features as well as the long-term course of adult- and juvenile-onset systemic Still's disease are similar, but further studies of genetic markers and immunopathology are required to establish a common pathophysiology.",

Three different coagulation groups were recognised: those with normal clotting values (group 1); those with high concentrations of factor VIII but otherwise normal clotting results (group 2); and patients who showed the presence of an activator of the intrinsic coagulation pathway, indicated by the presence of a short activated partial thromboplastin time or the ability of patients' plasma to shorten control clotting time in mixing studies (group 3). Patients in group 2 either had a uniform rise in all three components of the factor VIII molecule or a disproportionately higher concentration of factor-VIII-related antigen. In contrast, the level of VIII clotting activity in patients in group 3 was always higher than concentrations of either VIIIAg or VIIIWF. A significantly high incidence of thrombotic complications was observed in patients with group 3 but in none of the patients in either group 1 or group 2. Impaired renal function was more common in patients in groups 2 and 3, with higher mean serum creatinine concentrations in those with group 3. Patients with glomerulonephritis who have a short partial thromboplastin time with kaolin or who shorten control clotting time form a subgroup in whom hypercoagulation could adversely affect the course of their disease.

Fluorimetric assay results were analyzed kinetically with a mathematical model corresponding to a single diffusion compartment model. The results showed only a slight increase in the absorption half-time in old subjects, and a marked increase in elimination half-time (3.71 and 2.38 h in old and young subjects, respectively; t = 2.33: p less than 0.05) and in the volume of distribution (5.51 and 3.83 liters respectively; t = 3.20: p less than 0.1). On the other hand, bioavailability varied little, as did metabolic clearance.

Increased blood viscosity (13.64 +\/- 3.3 cp) was also noted in the patients (controls 10.8 +\/- 0.9 cp). Determination of platelet half-life and fibrinogen half-life demonstrated that these were both shortened (P less than .001). Predominant shortening of platelet half-life was observed in 3 of the 4 patients during heparin therapy but this reverted to normal during therapy with the antiplatelet agent (Persantin). These findings signify the presence of a low-grade intravascular coagulation which perhaps occurs in the glomerular capillaries.

The results indicate that the drug therapy proved to be effective in decreasing urinary protein and controlling nephrotic condition in 40% of the cases after an initial period of treatment. Long-term results of the drug on urinary protein and on nephrotic condition were rated as good in 36.7 and 53.3%, respectively, of the cases treated. The exact mechanism of action of dipyridamole in the nephrotic syndrome is still obscure in many respects. However, the fact that the drug shares its anti-platelet action with the non-steroid anti-inflammatory drugs, e.g. aspirin and indomethacin, and the rapidity with which it produces its urinary protein-decreasing effect, strongly suggests that it inhibits the release of vasoactive amines and other chemical mediators from blood platelets. As far as the present study is concerned, adverse side effects of dipyridamole were few or minimal, even when the drug used in large doses over a prolonged period of time. From these results it is considered that dipyridamole provides a new remedy which is worthy of trying in nephrotic syndrome as a means of reducing the requirement of steroids and immunosuppressive drugs.",

We include evidence that suggests the disease has two distinct pathogenetic mechanisms. First, a shock-like terminal phase is associated with the development of widespread pulmonary microvascular thrombosis. These thrombi, composed largely of platelets and leukocytes, produce severe cor pulmonale that cannot be prevented with heparin sodium treatment. Meningococcal endotoxin also produces disseminated intravascular coagulation, which includes the rapid consumption of fibrinogen and the formation of fibrin thrombi in adrenal and renal glomerular capillaries, causing hemorrhagic infarction of the adrenal glands and renal cortical necrosis. This secondary phase of the disease can be modified with heparin therapy, but its control does not improve survival because the parenchymal lesions produced are not immediately life threatening.",

Warfarin plus dipyridamole seem to have some effect in patients renal allografts. Sulfinpyrazone and ASA reduced the incidence of shunt thromboses in hemodialyzed patients.

No controlled study is yet available but a review of an additional 36 reported patients who fulfill adequate criteria for the diagnosis of adult hemolytic uremic syndrome suggests that consideration should be given to a trial of heparin therapy in patients with this syndrome in whom renal biopsy shows recoverable glomeruli in the presence of persistent severe impairment of renal function.",

        "Abstract":"Seventy-four patients aged 14 months to 71 years, classified as ASA I and II were anesthetised with Ethrane for surgical interventions of mean duration 117 minutes. With the exception of 5 patients who were directly anesthetised with Ethrane, the others received Ethrane after induction with Penthiobarbitone. Maintenance of anesthesia was ensured with 1 to 4p. 100 concentrations of Ethrane and 33p. 100 oxygen and 66p. 100 nitrous oxide. Tracheal intubation was facilitated by injection of 1 mg\/kg of succinylcholine. Induction with enflurane is rapid with no phenomena of excitation or irritation of the ear passages. The cardiovascular apparatus is stable with no arrythmia but an increase in heart rate of 11 to 50p. 100 is noted and in 41p. 100 of the cases hypotension of 35p. 100 of the intitial value. During spontaneous ventilation, a type of rapid and superficial respiration is observed with a flow volume of 5.3 ml\/kg for an average frequency of 25\/min. The arterial blood gases show slight hypercapnia. Myorelaxation is significant and better than that obtained with halothane. Coming round poses few problems apart from agitation in adolescents. Response to simple orders appears at 13 minutes. Trembling and rigidity occur in 41p. 100 of the cases for 5 to 30 minutes. From the hepatic point of view, no lastin enzyme changes were noted and no renal toxicity was demonstrated. Ethrane appears to be a good anesthetic agent but the few advantages mentioned means that it does not fulfil ideal conditions.",

        "Abstract":"To determine if the common practice of giving antacids to patients on salicylate therapy has an effect on serum salicylate concentrations, we gave a widely used antacid, aluminum and magnesium hydroxide, and aspirin concomitantly to three children with rheumatic fever. Urinary pH increased appreciably, and serum salicylate concentrations decreased by 30 to 70 per cent. In five healthy adult volunteers concomitant administration of antacid had no effect on the bioavailability of aspirin. Pharmacokinetic analysis revealed that the antacid-induced decrease of serum salicylate concentrations was due to increased renal clearance of salicylate caused by the rise in urinalry pH.",

        "Abstract":"The extent and nature of furosemide (F) binding to human albumin (HA) and to the plasma of 6 children with nephrotic syndrome were studied by equilibrium dialysis at 37 degrees C and pH 7.4 with 14C-F. At a total concentration of 3.4 mug\/ml (therapeutic range), the unbound fraction of F to 4 gm per 100 ml HA was 2.79 plus or minus 0.35. The degree of binding was relatively constant from 1.8 to 36 mug\/ml of F concentration. The percentage of unbound F doubled when total concentration of the drug was increased more than 130 times (1.8 to 245 mug\/ml). F has two classes of binding sites (n1 = 1.42, k1 = 5.07 times 10-4 M-minus 1; n2 = 3.4, k2 = 1.58 times 10-4 M-minus 1); interaction with HA involves hydrophobic, ionic, and hydrogen forces. Acetylsalicylic acid (ASA), acetazolamide, diazoxide, phenylbutazone, sulfisoxazole (S), and tolbutamide (T) decreased F binding. Combinations of ASA, S, and T exerted a strong additive displacing effect. The binding of the F metabolite (4-chloro-5-sulfamoylanthranilic acid, CSA) was studied at 1.3 and 2.6 mug\/ml. The unbound fraction was 5 times that of F. CSA did not influence F binding. Studies with plasma of 7 healthy adults showed that albumin is the only plasma protein responsible for F binding. The plasma albumin concentration range of the children with nephrotic syndrome was 0.6 to 2.1 gm per 100 ml. There was some correlation between albumin concentration and binding of F (2.8 to 9.6% unbound); this corresponded with findings with HA. Albumin concentrations lower than 2 gm per 100 ml seemed to influence the extent of the unbound fraction of F considerably.",

        "Abstract":"The purpose of this study was to determine the amount of salicylate acquired by a newborn infant from a mother who took 6.5 gm of aspirin a day during her entire pregnancy, and to characterize the kinetics of salicylate elimination by the infant. This healthy female infant was born with a salicylic acid concentration of 25 mg\/100 ml plasma and 75 mg\/kg body weight. The drug was eliminated during the first 5 days of life, primarily in the form of salicyluric acid. Salicylate elimination was relatively slower than in normal adults, but more rapid than in newborn infants of mothers who had taken only one small dose of aspirin shortly before delivery. The apparent in vivo KM and Vmax for salicylurate formation, on a body weight basis, were at the adult level. The slower elimination of salicylate (relative to adults) by the infant was due to immaturity of the glucuronidation and renal excretory pathways.",
