                "b": "In the remission goal group (DAS <1.6), baseline DAS was lower than in the low disease activity goal group (DAS â‰¤2.4) targeted group; symptom duration was shorter and baseline radiological damage was less often present. The investigators adjusted for these differences in their analyses, but this could have still favored the remission goal group"
