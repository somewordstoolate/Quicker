The study was blinded and did not show evidence of incomplete outcome reporting or selective outcome reporting, but the generalizability may be limited to patients with stable low disease activity. The funding source (industry sponsorship) is noted but does not appear to have introduced significant bias. Overall, the evidence is robust but warrants caution due to the sample size and reporting limitations."
