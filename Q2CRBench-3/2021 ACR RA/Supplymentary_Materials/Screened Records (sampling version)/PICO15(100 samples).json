        "Abstract":"The history of the rheumatologic use of methotrexate until the 1990s will be reviewed, beginning with its pharmacology, with the focus on rheumatoid arthritis (RA). The insufficient availability of cortisone in the 1950s as well as the early recognition of its potential toxicity stimulated searches for alternative anti-inflammatory drugs. Two related derivatives of folic acid, aminopterin and amethopterin (MTX,) were found to give rapid symptomatic relief in cases of psoriasis vulgaris and psoriatic arthritis. For several years MTX was used primarily to treat psoriasis, and the dermatologic treatment protocols came to be used by rheumatologists. Giving MTX weekly rather than daily was found to diminish the risk of toxic effects. MTX became favoured over cyclophosphamide because of its lack of carcinogenicity, and although azathioprine lacked the hepatotoxicity of MTX, its anti-rheumatic effects were considered to be somewhat weaker. Although trials of MTX for the treatment of severe RA began in the 1960s, the first placebo-controlled study of MTX in RA was reported in 1985 and a comparison with Myochrysine in 1987. MTX has replaced gold compounds because it has been found to be more rapidly effective and better tolerated. The mechanisms of its anti-rheumatic effects remain incompletely explained, as are explanations of instances of its failure. Its recent use in combination with anti-TNFalpha agents appears to be another therapeutic advance.",

        "Published":"2001 Nov",
        "Abstract":"OBJECTIVE: To study the possible relationship between the C677T mutation in the methylenetetrahydrofolate reductase (MTHFR) gene and the toxicity and efficacy of treatment with methotrexate (MTX) in patients with rheumatoid arthritis (RA). METHODS: Genotype analysis of the MTHFR gene was done in 236 patients who started MTX treatment with (n = 157) or without (n = 79) folic or folinic acid supplementation. Outcomes were parameters of efficacy of MTX treatment, patient withdrawal due to adverse events, discontinuation of MTX treatment because of elevated liver enzyme levels, and the total occurrence of elevated liver enzyme levels during the study. Multivariate logistic regression analysis was used to study the relationship between the presence of the MTHFR C677T mutation and toxicity outcomes of MTX treatment. RESULTS: Forty-eight percent of the patients showed the homozygous (T\/T) or heterozygous (T\/C) mutation. The presence of the C677CT or C677TT genotypes was associated with an increased risk of discontinuing MTX treatment because of adverse events (relative risk 2.01; 95% confidence interval 1.09, 3.70), mainly due to an increased risk of elevated liver enzyme levels (relative risk 2.38; 95% confidence interval 1.06, 5.34). Efficacy parameters were not significantly different between the patients with and those without the mutation. CONCLUSION: The C677T mutation is the first identified genetic risk factor for elevated alanine aminotransferase values during MTX treatment in patients with RA. We postulate that the incidence of clinically important elevation of liver enzyme levels during MTX treatment is mediated by homocysteine metabolism. Supplementation with folic or folinic acid reduced the risk of toxicity-related discontinuation of MTX treatment both in patients with and in patients without the mutation.",

        "Published":"2011 May",
        "Abstract":"BACKGROUND\/AIM: To define practical use and to specify the ideal method for monitoring the liver toxicity of MTX in the management of psoriasis. OBJECTIVE: To systematically review the literature regarding treatment modalities with methotrexate (MTX) in psoriasis, risk of MTX-mediated liver fibrosis and monitoring of hepatic toxicity. METHODS: A systematic literature search was carried out in Medline, Embase and Cochrane Library databases from 1980 to 2010 searching for randomized controlled trials and observational studies on methods of administering MTX in psoriasis and risk factors and assessment of liver toxicity. We limited the literature search to articles on human subjects over 19 years of age, articles in English or French on psoriasis and articles including psoriatic arthritis and original data. RESULTS: Among 949 references identified, 23 published studies were included. There were no studies focusing directly on the question of MTX treatment modalities. Treatment outcome appears to be dose dependent. A single study in rheumatoid arthritis showed the slightly superior efficacy of subcutaneous administration vs. oral dosing with a similar safety profile. Combination with folic acid may decrease the efficacy of MTX while improving tolerability. The extreme variability of the incidence of hepatic fibrosis in the literature does not allow the risk of hepatic fibrosis to be quantified. Type 2 diabetes and obesity, were associated with a significant increased risk of liver fibrosis. Hepatitis B and C and alcohol consumption were associated with a modest and non-significant increased risk of liver fibrosis. Procollagen III for detection of hepatic fibrosis dosing was the most extensively validated method to monitor liver fibrosis showing a sensitivity of 77.3% and a specificity of 91.5%. The Positive Predictive Value and Negative Predictive Value fluctuated depending on the prevalence of hepatic fibrosis. The sensitivities of the FibroTest and the fibroscan were of 83 and 50%, respectively, with specific features amounting to 61 and 88% respectively. CONCLUSIONS: Based on expert experience, the starting dose of MTX is between 5 and 10 mg\/week for the first week. Fast dose escalation is recommended in order to obtain a therapeutic target dose of 15-25 mg\/week. The maximum recommended dose is 25 mg\/week. A folic acid supplement is necessary. The initiation of treatment by oral administration is preferred. In cases where inadequate response is obtained or in the event of poor gastrointestinal tolerance, subcutaneous dosing can be proposed at the same dose. Published data do not confirm the incidence of hepatic fibrosis. Type 2 diabetes and obesity appear to be significant risk factors in fibrosis. A combination of FibroTests and fibroscans together with measurement of the type III serum procollagen aminopeptide seem to be ideal method for monitoring liver toxicity.

        "Abstract":"OBJECTIVE: To investigate the contribution of red blood cell (RBC) methotrexate polyglutamates (MTX PGs), RBC folate polyglutamates (folate PGs), and a pharmacogenetic index to the clinical status of patients with rheumatoid arthritis treated with MTX. METHODS: 226 adult patients treated with weekly MTX for more than 3 months were enrolled at three sites in a multicentred cross sectional observational study. Clinical status was assessed by the number of joint counts, physician's global assessment of disease activity, and a modified Health Assessment Questionnaire (mHAQ). RBC MTX PG and folate PG metabolite levels were measured by high performance liquid chromatography fluorometry and radioassay, respectively. A composite pharmacogenetic index comprising low penetrance genetic polymorphisms in reduced folate carrier (RFC-1 G80A), AICAR transformylase (ATIC C347G), and thymidylate synthase (TSER*2\/*3) was calculated. Statistical analyses were by multivariate linear regression with clinical measures as dependent variables and metabolite levels and the pharmacogenetic index as independent variables after adjustment for other covariates. RESULTS: Multivariate analysis showed that lower RBC MTX PG levels (median 40 nmol\/l) and a lower pharmacogenetic index (median 2) were associated with a higher number of joint counts, higher disease activity, and higher mHAQ (p<0.09). Multivariate analysis also established that higher RBC folate PG levels (median 1062 nmol\/l) were associated with a higher number of tender and swollen joints after adjustment for RBC MTX PG levels and the pharmacogenetic index (p<0.05). CONCLUSION: Pharmacogenetic and metabolite measurements may be useful in optimising MTX treatment. Prospective studies are warranted to investigate the predictive value of these markers for MTX efficacy.",

        "Published":"2014 Jun 10",
        "Abstract":"BACKGROUND: Methotrexate is a folic acid antagonist widely used for the treatment of neoplastic disorders. Methotrexate inhibits the synthesis of deoxyribonucleic acid (DNA), ribonucleic acid (RNA) and proteins by binding to dihydrofolate reductase. Currently, methotrexate is among the most commonly used drugs for the treatment of rheumatoid arthritis (RA). This is an update of the previous Cochrane systematic review published in 1997. OBJECTIVES: To evaluate short term benefits and harms of methotrexate for treating RA compared to placebo. SEARCH METHODS: The Cochrane Musculoskeletal Group Trials Register, The Cochrane Central Register of Controlled Trials (CENTRAL), MEDLINE and EMBASE were searched from 1966 to 1997 and then updated to November 2013. The search was complemented with a bibliography search of the reference lists of trials retrieved from the electronic search. SELECTION CRITERIA: Randomized controlled trials and controlled clinical trials comparing methotrexate (MTX) monotherapy against placebo alone in people with RA. Any trial duration and MTX doses were included. DATA COLLECTION AND ANALYSIS: Two review authors independently determined which studies were eligible for inclusion, extracted data and assessed risk of bias. Outcomes were pooled using mean differences (MDs) for continuous variables or standardized mean differences (SMDs) when different scales were used to measure the same outcome. Pooled risk ratio (RR) was used for dichotomous variables. Fixed-effect models were used throughout, although random-effects models were used for outcomes showing heterogeneity. MAIN RESULTS: Five trials with 300 patients were included in the original version of the review. An additional two trials with 432 patients were added to the 2013 update of the review for a total of 732 participants. The trials were generally of unclear to low risk of bias with a follow-up duration ranging from 12 to 52 weeks. All trials included patients who have failed prior treatment (for example, gold therapy, D-penicillamine, azathioprine or anti-malarials); mean disease duration that ranged between 1 and 14 years with six trials reporting more than 4 years; and weekly doses that ranged between 5 mg and 25 mg. BENEFITS: Statistically significant and clinically important differences were observed for most efficacy outcomes. MTX monotherapy showed a clinically important and statistically significant improvement in the American College of Rheumatology (ACR) 50 response rate when compared with placebo at 52 weeks (RR 3.0, 95% confidence interval (CI) 1.5 to 6.0; number needed to treat (NNT) 7, 95% CI 4 to 22). Fifteen more patients out of 100 had a major improvement in the ACR 50 outcome compared to placebo (absolute treatment benefit (ATB) 15%, 95% CI 8% to 23%). Statistically significant improvement in physical function (scale of 0 to 3) was also observed in patients receiving MTX alone compared with placebo at 12 to 52 weeks (MD -0.27, 95% CI -0.39 to -0.16; odds ratio (OR) 2.8, 95% CI 0.23 to 32.2; NNT 4, 95% CI 3 to 7). Nine more patients out of 100 improved in physical function compared to placebo (ATB -9%, 95% CI -13% to -5.3%). Similarly, the proportion of patients who improved at least 20% on the Short Form-36 (SF-36) physical component was higher in the MTX-treated group compared with placebo at 52 weeks (RR 1.5, 95% CI 1.0 to 2.1; NNT 9, 95% CI 4 to 539). Twelve more patients out of 100 showed an improvement of at least 20% in the physical component of the quality of life measure compared to placebo (ATB 12%, 95% CI 1% to 24%). No clinically important or statistically significant differences were observed in the SF-36 mental component.Although no statistically significant differences were observed in radiographic scores (that is, Total Sharp score, erosion score, joint space narrowing), radiographic progression rates (measured by an increase in erosion scores of more than 3 units on a scale ranging from 0 to 448) were statistically significantly lower for patients in the MTX group compared with placebo-treated patients (RR 0.31, 95% CI 0.11 to 0.86; NNT 13, 95% CI 10 to 60). Eight more patients out of 100 showed less damage to joints measured by an increase in erosion scores compared to placebo (ATB -8%, 95% CI -16% to -1%). In the one study measuring remission, no participants in either group met the remission criteria. These are defined by at least five of (>= 2 months): morning stiffness of < 15 minutes, no fatigue, no joint pain by history, no joint tenderness, no joint swelling, and Westergren erythrocyte sedimentation rate (ESR) of < 20 mm\/hr in men and < 30 mm\/hr in women. HARMS: Patients in the MTX monotherapy group were twice as likely to discontinue from the study due to adverse events compared to patients in the placebo group, at 12 to 52 weeks (16% versus 8%; RR 2.1, 95% CI 1.3 to 3.3; NNT 13, 95% CI 6 to 44). Compared to placebo, nine more people out of 100 who took MTX withdrew from the studies because of side effects (ATB 9%, 95% CI 3% to 14%). Total adverse event rates at 12 weeks were higher in the MTX monotherapy group compared to the placebo group (45% versus 15%; RR 3.0, 95% CI 1.4 to 6.4; NNT 4, 95% CI 2 to 17). Thirty more people out of 100 who took MTX compared to those who took placebo experienced any type of side effect (common or rare) (ATB 30, 95% CI 13% to 47%). No statistically significant differences were observed in the total number of serious adverse events between the MTX group and the placebo group at 27 to 52 weeks. Three people out of 100 who took MTX alone experienced rare but serious side effects compared to 2 people out of 100 who took a placebo (3% versus 2%, respectively). AUTHORS' CONCLUSIONS: Based on mainly moderate to high quality evidence, methotrexate (weekly doses ranging between 5 mg and 25 mg) showed a substantial clinical and statistically significant benefit compared to placebo in the short term treatment (12 to 52 weeks) of people with RA, although its use was associated with a 16% discontinuation rate due to adverse events.",

PATIENTS & METHODS: The study included 233 consecutively recruited patients with rheumatoid arthritis under MTX treatment. The SLC19A1 G80A polymorphism was evaluated by PCR-RFLP. RESULTS: Statistical analysis revealed that SLC19A1 80G carriers had increased risk of gastrointestinal toxicity (odds ratio [OR]: 2.61, p = 0.019) and that regular folic acid supplementation was associated with both overall and gastrointestinal toxicity protection (OR: 0.15, p < 0.001 and OR: 0.19, p < 0.001, respectively). Multivariate analysis confirmed the association of SLC19A1 80G and regular folic acid supplementation to gastrointestinal toxicity (OR: 5.53 and 0.13, respectively). Moreover, a multivariate Cox regression model demonstrated a higher risk of earlier gastrointestinal toxicity in SLC19A1 80G carriers (hazard ratio: 3.63, p = 0.002). CONCLUSION: SLC19A1 G80A genotyping may be a useful tool for clinicians to identify patients at higher risk for developing gastrointestinal toxicity related to MTX treatment.",

        "Abstract":"The objective of this study was to investigate risk factors for cytopenia when a prophylactic dose of trimethoprim-sulfamethoxazole (TMP-SMX) was co-administered with methotrexate (MTX). Patients who received MTX with or without a prophylactic dose of TMP-SMX were included. Patients who received a therapeutic dose of TMP-SMX were excluded. The MTX-alone and MTX with TMP-SMX groups (MTX group and MTX + TMP-SMX group, respectively) were matched in a 4:1 ratio according to age, creatinine level, mean corpuscular volume and MTX dose. Cytopenia was defined as a haemoglobin level decrease by > 2 g\/dl, platelet count of < 150,000\/mm3 or white blood cell count of < 3500\/mm3. The Cox proportional hazards model was used to evaluate risk factors for cytopenia in patients administered with MTX. The incidence of cytopenia did not significantly differ between the MTX group and MTX + TMP-SMX group (5.0 vs 5.7%, p > 0.999). According to the Cox proportional hazards model, chronic liver disease (hazard ratio [HR] 5.829, 95% confidence interval [CI] 1.211-28.063, p = 0.028) was associated with an increased risk of cytopenia. However, the concomitant use of a prophylactic dose of TMP-SMX (HR 1.717, 95% CI 0.352-8.371, p = 0.504) was not significantly associated with an increased risk of cytopenia. Compared with the use of MTX alone, the concomitant use of MTX with a prophylactic dose of TMP-SMX was not significantly associated with an increased risk of cytopenia. Thus, a prophylactic dose of TMP-SMX can be safely used with MTX.",

        "Abstract":"The treatment of chronic inflammatory conditions often involves a difficult balance between the benefits of disease modification and the risks attendant with the use of disease-modifying agents. Methotrexate is a useful and commonly used disease-modifying agent but has a particularly notable reputation for causing morbidity and mortality. We explore ways in which the safety of methotrexate prescribing may be improved. There has been considerable debate as to the whether some of the side-effects can be mitigated by co-prescription of folate with methotrexate. Whereas no definitive conclusion can yet be reached, evidence suggests that the improvement in side-effect profile is limited to fewer elevations of liver enzymes, but that this may be at the expense of decreased methotrexate efficacy. The question remains as to whether the improved tolerability more than compensates for the decreased efficacy or whether folic acid should be used in a more circumspect way. However, a very specific danger arises from the fact that methotrexate is prescribed once weekly for inflammatory conditions, leading to errors at both the prescription and patient level. We highlight simple ways of improving safety to decrease such errors.",

        "Published":"2015 Jun 11",
        "Abstract":"INTRODUCTION: There is reasonable evidence that folic acid 5-10 mg per week leads to reduction in methotrexate (MTX) toxicity in rheumatoid arthritis (RA). However, this is based on studies conducted with lower MTX dosage than used currently. It is unclear whether higher doses of folic acid may be better in reducing toxicity. METHODS: This was a double-blind randomized controlled trial of 24 weeks duration. To be eligible, patients should have rheumatoid arthritis (1987 American College of Rheumatology criteria), be 18-75 years of age, not be on MTX and have active disease as defined by 'Modified Disease Activity Score using three variables' (DAS28(3)) > 3.2. MTX was started at 10 mg\/week and escalated to 25 mg\/week by 12 weeks. Folic acid was given at a dose of 10 mg (FA10) or 30 mg per week (FA30). Co-primary endpoints were incidence of toxicity (undesirable symptoms and laboratory abnormalities) and change in disease activity by 24 weeks. Intention-to-treat and per-protocol analyses were performed. RESULTS: Among 100 patients enrolled, 51 and 49 were randomized to FA10 and FA30 respectively. By 24 weeks, there were 6 patient withdrawals in either group and mean(+\/-SD) dose of MTX was 22.8 +\/- 4.4 and 21.4 +\/- 4.6 mg per week (p = 0.1). Frequency of patients with undesirable symptoms was non-significantly lower by 7.4% (95% confidence interval -27.4 to 12.7%) in FA10 compared to FA30. There was also no difference in frequency of transaminitis (>Upper limit of normal (ULN)) (42.6, 45.7%, p = 0.7) or transminitis as per primary endpoint (>2xULN) (10.6, 8.7%, p = 1.0) or cytopenias (4.3, 4.3%, p = 0.9). There was no difference in the primary end-point of occurrence of any adverse effect (symptom or laboratory) in FA10 and FA30 (46.8, 54.3%, p = 0.5). At 24 weeks, DAS28(3) declined in both groups by a similar extent (-1.1 +\/- 1.0, -1.3 +\/- 1.0, p = 0.2) and 'European League Against Rheumatism' good or moderate response occurred in 56.9 and 67.4% (p = 0.3). CONCLUSIONS: Even with the high doses of MTX used in current practice, there was no additional benefit (or harm) of a higher dose of folic acid (30 mg\/week) over a usual dose (10 mg\/week).

        "Published":"2011 Dec",
        "Abstract":"Over the past three decades, numerous reports have addressed several aspects of drug resistance phenomena. However, little is known regarding the impact that dietary components and nutritional supplements have on the mechanisms of resistance that malignant cells develop to chemotherapeutic agents. The increased fortification of cereals, grains and bread with folic acid (FA) has resulted in a marked rise in folate levels in blood and tissues. Vitamin fortification that includes FA is rather commonly used by cancer patients, but FA is also used to protect against pemetrexed induced side effects in the treatment of non-small cell lung cancer and mesothelioma or that of the antifolate methotrexate in rheumatoid arthritis. Moreover, the reduced folate leucovorin (LV, 5-formyltetrahydrofolate) is also used along with 5-fluorouracil in the treatment of colorectal cancer. Likewise, LV is used to reduce toxicity of methotrexate in the treatment of leukemia. FA can also increase efficacy of unrelated regimens, containing cisplatin. Hence there is growing evidence that dietary supplements as folic acid, can mimic, intensify, or attenuate the effects of unrelated chemotherapeutic agents. The aim of this review is to highlight some new insights in the cellular and molecular mechanisms affected by folate status, leading to chemotherapy resistance, especially towards antifolates in colorectal cancer treatment. This encompasses the effect of folate status on drug export, as well as on the increased expression of mutated target enzymes involved in folate metabolism and on the augmentation of cellular folate pools that impair polyglutamylation of antifolates, ultimately affecting treatment efficacy.",

        "Published":"2013 Nov",
        "Abstract":"OBJECTIVE: To investigate whether baseline concentrations of one-carbon metabolism biomarkers are associated with treatment nonresponse and adverse events in rheumatoid arthritis (RA) patients receiving methotrexate (MTX). METHODS: A prospective derivation cohort (n = 285) and validation cohort (n = 102) of RA patients receiving MTX were studied. Concentrations of plasma homocysteine, serum vitamin B12 , serum folate, erythrocyte vitamin B6 , and erythrocyte folate were determined at baseline and after 3 months of treatment. Nonresponse after 3 months was assessed using the Disease Activity Score in 28 joints (DAS28) and the European League Against Rheumatism (EULAR) response criteria. Adverse events at 3 months were assessed using biochemical parameters and health status questionnaires. Analyses were corrected for baseline DAS28, age, sex, MTX dose, comedications, and presence of the methylenetetrahydrofolate reductase 677TT genotype. RESULTS: In the derivation cohort, the mean DAS28 scores at baseline and 3 months were 4.94 and 3.12, respectively, and 78% of patients experienced adverse events. This was similar between the 2 cohorts, despite a lower MTX dose in the validation cohort. Patients with lower levels of erythrocyte folate at baseline had a higher DAS28 at 3 months in both the derivation cohort (beta = -0.15, P = 0.037) and the validation cohort (beta = -0.20, P = 0.048). In line with these results, lower baseline erythrocyte folate levels were linearly associated with a 3-month DAS28 of >3.2 in both cohorts (derivation cohort, P = 0.049; validation cohort, P = 0.021) and with nonresponse according to the EULAR criteria (derivation cohort, P = 0.066; validation cohort, P = 0.027). None of the other biomarkers (levels at baseline or changes over 3 months) were associated with the DAS28 or treatment nonresponse. Baseline levels of the biomarkers and changes in levels after 3 months were not associated with incidence of adverse events. CONCLUSION: A low baseline concentration of erythrocyte folate is associated with high disease activity and nonresponse at 3 months after the start of MTX treatment and could be used in prediction models for MTX outcome. None of the investigated one-carbon metabolism biomarkers were associated with incidence of adverse events at 3 months. Copyright © 2013 by the American College of Rheumatology.",

        "Abstract":"A woman aged 77 years with a history of rheumatoid arthritis (RA) presented with inflammatory colitis confined to her rectum, which was incidentally found by a screening colonoscopy. Histopathological examination of colonic biopsies showed non-specific inflammatory infiltrates of lymphocytes, the cause of which was unknown. She had been diagnosed with RA 5 years before, and she was receiving methotrexate 6 mg weekly, to which tocilizumab had been added 4 years earlier, which achieved stable control of her disease. She had no gastrointestinal symptoms or other health problems. Tocilizumab-induced colitis was considered likely, and the drug was discontinued. Metronidazole was also prescribed because of possible Clostridium difficile-associated colitis. 3 months later, a repeat colonoscopy showed no improvement of the colitis. The methotrexate was also discontinued, and folinic acid was prescribed daily for 2 weeks, leading to complete resolution of the colitis observed at repeat colonoscopy.

        "Published":"2002",
        "Abstract":"This study investigated the cost-effectiveness of leflunomide (LEF) compared to methotrexate (MTX) and sulfasalazine (SSZ) in the United Kingdom. A Markov model was constructed using health states defined by Health Assessment Questionnaire score. The model is based on a cohort of patients with recently diagnosed definite RA who were followed for up to 15 years at nine rheumatology clinics in the UK. The treatment effect was calculated based on clinical trials comparing LEF to MTX (one international and one United States trial) and to SSZ (one international trial). Transitions between health states for the first 2 years of treatment were calculated from the clinical trials, while the extrapolation beyond the trial was based on the Early Rheumatoid Arthritis Study cohort, using an ordered probit model. This makes it possible to predict transitions for patients with similar characteristics (age, time since disease onset) as in the trials. Separate analyses were performed for each trial, and all analyses covered a 10-year timeframe. Using the US trial, LEF had slightly lower costs and better effects (44,017 and 4.307 pounds QALYs, compared to 44,988 and 4.158 pounds QALYs for MTX), while for the international trial this was reversed (34,070 and 4.487 pounds QALYs for MTX compared to 36,351 and 4.372 pounds QALYs for LEF). Compared to SSZ, the cost of using LEF was slightly lower, with an increase in QALYs (35,855 and 3.896 pounds QALYs compared to 36,731 and 3.721 pounds QALYs for SSZ). The two trials comparing LEF to MTX gave differing results. One possible reason for this is that MTX patients in the US trial were given folic acid, whereas in the international trial folate supplementation was not mandated. This may have reduced the effectiveness of MTX. In the UK it is standard practice to use folic acid with MTX, and therefore the results from the US trial may be more relevant for the UK. Compared to SSZ, the use of LEF appears to be cost-effective in the UK.",

        "Abstract":"OBJECTIVE: To examine the relationship between hepatotoxic risk factors and liver histopathology in patients with juvenile rheumatoid arthritis (JRA) treated with methotrexate (MTX). STUDY DESIGN: We graded the histology of 33 percutaneous liver biopsy specimens from 25 patients with JRA treated at Children's Hospital Medical Center, Cincinnati, Ohio, using the Roenigk Classification Scale. Stepwise linear and logistic regression analyses were performed to examine the relationship of the Roenigk grade and presence of liver fibrosis of biopsy specimens with potential risk factors. RESULTS: Twenty-seven biopsy specimens (82%) were classified as grade I, 4 (12%) as grade II, and 2 (6%) as grade IIIA; none demonstrated significant fibrosis. The frequency of biochemical abnormalities (P <.001) and body mass index (P =.05) were the only risk factors found to significantly relate to the Roenigk grade. The following factors were not significantly associated with the Roenigk grade: age, gender, disease duration, JRA subtype and course, duration of MTX administration, weekly MTX dose, cumulative dose of MTX, route of MTX administration, use of folic acid supplementation, concurrent use of other medications, and potential hepatotoxic comorbidities. CONCLUSIONS: Serial biochemical abnormalities are significantly associated with Roenigk grade and the presence of liver fibrosis. These findings concur with studies of patients with rheumatoid arthritis, suggesting that guidelines for monitoring MTX hepatotoxicity in rheumatoid arthritis may be applicable to patients with JRA.",

We describe the case of a 32 year old woman with rheumatoid arthritis treated with 12.5 mg of methotrexate once a week and 1 mg folic acid who developed paresthesias of her upper and lower extremities. Three years later, she acutely developed 6th nerve palsy, gait imbalance and urinary urgency and a diagnosis of multiple sclerosis was made. The use of methotrexate, though effective in controlling her rheumatoid arthritis, did not influence the development or progression of her multiple sclerosis. Although RA and MS may coexist in the same patient, treatment of one disease may have no influence on the clinical course of the other. Thus, the mechanism by which methotrexate suppresses disease activity in RA but not in MS despite both being T-cell mediated autoimmune diseases requires further investigative studies.",

Clinical trials have shown its effectiveness in these conditions and it is likely that dentists will encounter patients taking this drug in general dental practice. Oral ulceration can occur as a side effect of methotrexate therapy. This may be due to lack of folic acid supplementation or overdosage due to confusion regarding its once-weekly regime.

        "Published":"2000 Oct",
        "Abstract":"BACKGROUND: It is postulated that some aspects of methotrexate toxicity may be related to its action as an anti-folate. Folic acid (FA) is often given as an adjunct to methotrexate therapy, but there is no conclusive proof that it decreases the toxicity of methotrexate and there is a theoretical risk that it may decrease the efficacy of methotrexate. OBJECTIVES: To look at the effect of stopping FA supplementation in UK rheumatoid arthritis (RA) patients established on methotrexate <20 mg weekly and FA 5 mg daily, to report all toxicity (including absolute changes in haematological and liver enzyme indices) and to report changes in the efficacy of methotrexate. METHODS: In a prospective, randomized, double-blind, placebo-controlled study, 75 patients who were established on methotrexate <20 mg weekly and FA 5 mg daily were asked to stop their FA and were randomized to one of two groups: placebo or FA 5 mg daily. Patients were evaluated for treatment toxicity and efficacy before entry and then at intervals of 3 months for 1 yr. RESULTS: Overall, 25 (33%) patients concluded the study early, eight (21%) in the group remaining on FA and 17 (46%) in the placebo group (P = 0.02). Two patients in the placebo group discontinued because of neutropenia. At 9 months there was an increased incidence of nausea in the placebo group (45 vs. 7%, P = 0.001). The placebo group had significantly lower disease activity on a few of the variables measured, but these were probably not of clinical significance. CONCLUSIONS: It is important to continue FA supplementation over the long term in patients on methotrexate and FA in order to prevent them discontinuing treatment because of mouth ulcers or nausea and vomiting. Our data suggest that FA supplementation is also helpful in preventing neutropenia, with very little loss of efficacy of methotrexate.",

        "Published":"2013 May 31",
        "Abstract":"BACKGROUND: Methotrexate (MTX) is a disease modifying antirheumatic drug (DMARD) used as a first line agent for treating rheumatoid arthritis (RA). Pharmacologically, it is classified as an antimetabolite due to its antagonistic effect on folic acid metabolism. Many patients treated with MTX experience mucosal, gastrointestinal, hepatic or haematologic side effects. Supplementation with folic or folinic acid during treatment with MTX may ameliorate these side effects. OBJECTIVES: To identify trials of supplementation with folic acid or folinic acid during MTX therapy for rheumatoid arthritis and to assess the benefits and harms of folic acid and folinic acid (a) in reducing the mucosal, gastrointestinal (GI), hepatic and haematologic side effects of MTX, and (b) whether or not folic or folinic acid supplementation has any effect on MTX benefit. SEARCH METHODS: We originally performed MEDLINE searches, from January 1966 to June 1999. During the update of this review, we searched additional databases and used a sensitive search strategy designed to retrieve all trials on folic acid or folinic acid for rheumatoid arthritis from 1999 up to 2 March 2012. SELECTION CRITERIA: We selected all double-blind, randomised, placebo-controlled clinical trials (RCTs) in which adult patients with rheumatoid arthritis were treated with MTX (at a dose equal to or less than 25 mg\/week) concurrently with folate supplementation. In this update of the review we only included trials using 'low dose' folic or folinic acid (a starting dose of <= 7 mg weekly). DATA COLLECTION AND ANALYSIS: Data were extracted from the trials, and the trials were independently assessed for risk of bias using a predetermined set of criteria. MAIN RESULTS: Six trials with 624 patients were eligible for inclusion. Most studies had low or unclear risk of bias for key domains. The quality of the evidence was rated as 'moderate' for each outcome as assessed by GRADE, with the exception of haematologic side effects which were rated as 'low'. There was no significant heterogeneity between trials, including where folic acid and folinic acid studies were pooled.For patients supplemented with any form of exogenous folate (either folic or folinic acid) whilst on MTX therapy for rheumatoid arthritis, a 26% relative (9% absolute) risk reduction was seen for the incidence of GI side effects such as nausea, vomiting or abdominal pain (RR 0.74, 95% CI 0.59 to 0.92; P = 0.008). Folic and folinic acid also appear to be protective against abnormal serum transaminase elevation caused by MTX, with a 76.9% relative (16% absolute) risk reduction (RR 0.23, 95% CI 0.15 to 0.34; P < 0.00001), as well as reducing patient withdrawal from MTX for any reason (60.8% relative (15.2% absolute) risk reduction, RR 0.39, 95% CI 0.28 to 0.53; P < 0.00001). We analysed the effect of folic or folinic acid on the incidence of stomatitis \/ mouth sores, and whilst showing a trend towards reduction in risk, the results were not statistically significant (RR 0.72, 95% CI 0.49 to 1.06)It was not possible to draw meaningful conclusions on the effect of folic or folinic acid on haematologic side effects of methotrexate due to small numbers of events and poor reporting of this outcome in included trials.It does not appear that supplementation with either folic or folinic acid has a statistically significant effect on the efficacy of MTX in treating RA (as measured by RA disease activity parameters such as tender and swollen joint counts, or physician's global assessment scores). AUTHORS' CONCLUSIONS: The results support a protective effect of supplementation with either folic or folinic acid for patients with rheumatoid arthritis during treatment with MTX. There was a significant reduction shown in the incidence of GI side effects, hepatic dysfunction (asmeasured by elevated serum transaminase levels) as well as a significant reduction in discontinuation of MTX treatment for any reason. A trend towards a reduction in stomatitis was demonstrated however this did not reach statistical significance. This updated review with its focus on lower doses of folic acid and folinic acid and updated assessment of risk of bias aimed to give a more precise and more clinically relevant estimate of the benefit of folate supplementation for patients with rheumatoid arthritis receiving methotrexate.",

        "Published":"2018 Dec",
        "Abstract":"RATIONALE: The mechanisms of action of MTX (methotrexate) in the treatment of RA (rheumatoid arthritis) and PsA (psoriatic arthritis) is related to its antifolic activity, due to the high affinity for enzymes that require folate cofactors as dihydrofolate reductase and to the anti-inflammatory activity derivated from the inhibition of thymidylate synthetase that leads to the over-production of adenosine. PATIENT CONCERNS: Our patient was a 41-year-old female, affected by PsA in treatment since 2 years with low-dose methylprednisolone and low-dose subcutaneous MTX. The treatment was effective. The patient subacutely developed a severe paraparesis with impossibility of gait or standing without aid and was admitted to a Neurology Department where the cause of the paraparesis was not clear in spite of accurate radiological neurophysiologic and laboratory tests. Therefore, she was admitted in a rehabilitation unit. DIAGNOSIS AND INTERVENTIONS: Paraparesis in PsA patient in treatment with methotrexate. MTX toxicity was hypothesized; therefore the drug was discontinued while i.m. folic acid and cyanocobalamin were administered for 20 days. The diagnosis was clinical, based on neurological examination (paraparesis) and on the chronic use of MTX (hypothesis of toxicity). OUTCOMES: The patient obtained a complete resolution of paraparesis. Genetic analyses showed associated a compound heterozygosity for the c.1298A>C and c.677C>T variants of methylenetetrahydrofolate reductase (MTHFR) gene. LESSONS: Neurological side effects of MTX are uncommon. In literature no previous case of MTX induced paraparesis in patients treated with low-dose MTX for chronic arthritis has been described. The association between the gene polymorphisms of MTHFR (c.1298A>C and c.677C>T) and MTX toxicity in arthritis patients is confirmed. The case also confirms that folates are a precious antidote of MTX toxicity.",

In both the American trial (US301) and the multinational trial (MN302), patients with active rheumatoid arthritis (RA) were given either leflunomide (20 mg\/day after a loading dose of 100 mg\/day for 3 days) or methotrexate (7.5-15 mg\/week) for 52 weeks. US301 was also placebo-controlled. Folate supplementation was mandatory in US301 but was given to < 10% of the patients in MN302. In US301, American College of Rheumatology (ACR) 20% response rates and improvement in tender and swollen joints were significantly better than placebo in both treatment groups, but were not significantly different from each other. Both treatments significantly retarded radiographically assessed progression of RA compared to placebo, but the degree of retardation was significantly greater with leflunomide. In MN302, the ACR response rate and improvement in tender and swollen joints with leflunomide were similar to those seen in US301. The ACR response rate and improvements in all efficacy variables with methotrexate were significantly greater than with leflunomide, however. Radiographically assessed disease progression was not statistically different with the two treatments. Use of methotrexate without folate in MN302 was associated with a higher incidence of clinically significant elevations of liver enzyme levels. These results indicate that both leflunomide and methotrexate are effective DMARDs. The symptomatic relief provided by both drugs is similar when they are given with folate supplementation.",

        "Abstract":"OBJECTIVE: To determine whether the side effects of methotrexate can be decreased by the concurrent use of leucovorin, without affecting the efficacy of the methotrexate. METHODS: We conducted a multicenter randomized, double-blind, placebo-controlled trial of leucovorin administration, 2.5-5.0 mg orally, to be given 24 hours after the single, weekly, oral dose of methotrexate. Every 3 weeks for 52 weeks, patients were evaluated for rheumatic disease activity and side effects. Dosage adjustments for both methotrexate and leucovorin were made as needed, according to a defined protocol. The primary outcome evaluated was the frequency of study withdrawals because of side effects and\/or inefficacy. Secondary outcomes evaluated included the frequency of side effects and the relative efficacy of methotrexate in the leucovorin and placebo treatment groups. RESULTS: Ninety-two evaluable patients were analyzed (44 took leucovorin and 48 placebo). Twenty-two patients withdrew early because of side effects unresponsive to our protocol, and 1 because of inefficacy; 17 had been taking placebo and 6 had been taking leucovorin (35% versus 14%, P < 0.02). The number of visits during which side effects were reported was reduced by almost 50% in the leucovorin treatment group (P < 0.001). There were significant reductions in the frequencies of all common side effects. At 52 weeks, disease activity was similar in both patient groups. CONCLUSION: The methotrexate-leucovorin protocol used significantly reduces common side effects of methotrexate therapy without significantly altering efficacy.",

This is the first direct clinical evidence implying folate antagonism in the action of low-dose MTX therapy in rheumatoid arthritis patients.",

        "Abstract":"OBJECTIVE: To study the influence of sulphasalazine (SSZ), methotrexate (MTX), and the combination (COMBI) of both on plasma homocysteine and to study the relation between plasma homocysteine and their clinical effects. METHODS: 105 patients with early rheumatoid arthritis (RA) were randomised between SSZ (2-3 g\/day), MTX (7.5-15 mg\/week), and the COMBI (same dose range) and evaluated double blindly during 52 weeks. Plasma homocysteine, serum folate concentrations, and vitamin B12 were measured. The influence of the C677T mutation of the enzyme methyl-enetetrahydrofolatereductase (MTHFR) gene was analysed. RESULTS: A slight trend towards increased efficacy and an increased occurrence of minor gastrointestinal toxicity was present in the COMBI group, no differences existed clinically between SSZ and MTX. Only a slight and temporary increase in plasma homocysteine was found in the SSZ group, in contrast with the persistent rise in the MTX group and the even greater increase in the COMBI patients. Patients homozygous for the mutation in the MTHFR gene had significantly higher baseline homocysteine, heterozygous MTHFR genotype induced a significantly higher plasma homoeysteine at week 52 compared with no mutation. No correlation was found between clinical efficacy variables and homocysteine. Patients with gastrointestinal toxicity had a significantly greater increase in homocysteine. CONCLUSION: A persistent increase in plasma homocysteine concentrations was observed in patients treated with MTX alone and more pronounced in combination with SSZ, in contrast with SSZ alone. An increase in plasma homocysteine is related to the C677T mutation in MTHFR. A relation in the change in homocysteine concentrations with (gastrointestinal) toxicity was found, no relation with clinical efficacy existed.",

        "Abstract":"OBJECTIVES: The aim of this report is to demonstrate pharmacokinetic (PK) and pharmacodynamic (PD) equivalence as well as similar efficacy, safety and immunogenicity between GP2013, a biosimilar rituximab, and innovator rituximab (RTX) in patients with rheumatoid arthritis (RA) with inadequate response or intolerance to tumour necrosis factor inhibitor (TNFi) treatment. METHODS: In this multinational, randomised, double-blind, parallel-group study, 312 patients with active disease despite prior TNFi therapy were randomised to receive GP2013 or either the EU (RTX-EU) or the US (RTX-US) reference product, along with methotrexate (MTX) and folic acid. The primary endpoint was the area under the serum concentration-time curve from study drug infusion to infinity (AUC0-inf). Additional PK and PD parameters, along with efficacy, immunogenicity and safety outcomes were also assessed up to week 24. RESULTS: The 90% CI of the geometric mean ratio of the AUCs were within the bioequivalence limits of 80% to 125% for all three comparisons; GP2013 versus RTX-EU: 1.106 (90% CI 1.010 to 1.210); GP2013 versus RTX-US: 1.012 (90% CI 0.925 to 1.108); and RTX-EU versus RTX-US: 1.093 (90% CI 0.989 to 1.208). Three-way PD equivalence of B cell depletion was also demonstrated. Efficacy, safety and immunogenicity profiles were similar between GP2013 and RTX. CONCLUSIONS: Three-way PK\/PD equivalence of GP2013, RTX-EU and RTX-US was demonstrated. Efficacy, safety and immunogenicity profiles were similar between GP2013 and RTX.

METHODS: A total of 185 patients with RA were included. Homocysteine (Hcy) was assessed by fluorescence polarization immunoassay, and folate and vitamin B12 were measured by chemiluminescence immunoassays. The genetic polymorphisms were analyzed by PCR or PCR-RFLP. Hyperhomocysteinemia (HHC) was considered for Hcy > 15 micromol\/L. RESULTS: MTHFR C677T polymorphism was associated with HHC in RA patients (multi-adjusted OR, 95% CI 2.18, [1.07-4.57]; p = 0.031). No association was detected with the remaining polymorphisms. Plasma Hcy, folate, and vitamin B12 did not differ according to each polymorphism, or with MTX treatment or toxicity. However, HHC was more prevalent in patients with than those without MTX toxicity (32.7 vs. 16.7%; p = 0.035). CONCLUSIONS: The MTHFR 677TT genotype is an independent risk factor for HHC in Tunisians RA patients. HHC could be a useful marker of MTX toxicity in RA patients.",

        "Abstract":"OBJECTIVES: The objectives of this study were to evaluate the therapeutic efficacy of CPH 82 in comparison with methotrexate (MTX) in adult patients with early, active rheumatoid arthritis (RA) and to compare the tolerance and safety profiles of the two drugs. METHODS: The study was a 24-week, double-blind, randomized study in 10 centres of 100 patients with active RA, with a disease duration of less than 2 yr at the start of treatment, which consisted of either CPH 82 300 mg\/day or MTX 10 mg\/week. The six primary effect variables were: number of swollen joints, Ritchie's articular index, patient's pain score, patient's global score, Health Assessment Questionnaire (HAQ) and C-reactive protein (CRP). Erythrocyte sedimentation rate (ESR), physician's global score and the efficacy according to the European League Against Rheumatism (EULAR) and American College of Rheumatology (ACR) response criteria were also analysed. RESULTS: There was a significant improvement for both drugs in all variables. Significant differences between the drugs in favour of MTX were found only in patient's pain score, CRP and ESR. By the EULAR criteria, 76% and 86% were judged to be responders in the CPH 82 and MTX groups, respectively. By the ACR criteria, the corresponding figures were 58% and 64%. The most common side-effects were gastrointestinal, which were similar in both groups. The numbers of treatment failures due to adverse events were two with CPH 82 and 14 with MTX. CONCLUSIONS: The clinical effect of CPH 82 in this study was comparable to that of MTX at a dose of 10 mg\/week. Both drugs reduced acute-phase reactants, MTX more effectively than CPH 82. The safety profile of CPH 82 was more favourable than that of MTX without folic acid supplementation.",

        "Abstract":"A 66-year-old woman had progressive bilateral optic neuropathy with dense central scotomas and dyschromatopsia. She had been taking oral methotrexate 2.5 mg three times per week for rheumatoid arthritis for the previous 10 months (total intake 322.5 mg) without folic acid supplementation. She had never smoked or abused alcohol and her diet was healthy. Serum folate was reduced at 1.6 ng\/mL (normal >4 ng\/mL) and vitamin B12 levels were normal. After stopping methotrexate and after administration of oral folic acid, she experienced complete recovery of vision. Serum folate levels returned to normal during folic acid treatment but decreased to below normal once folic treatment was stopped. The persistently low folate level remains unexplained and may reflect a genetic defect in folate metabolism. Methotrexate can cause toxic side effects resulting from folate inhibition but has not been shown definitively to cause a reversible optic neuropathy associated with low serum folate.",

METHODS: Analyses were restricted to patients randomized to receive MTX who had rheumatoid factor data. The US study recruited 482 patients with active RA; 179 received at least 1 dose of MTX, and all were mandated to receive 1 mg of oral folic acid once or twice daily. The multinational European study recruited 999 patients with active RA; 489 received at least 1 dose of MTX, and oral folic acid was not required, although 50 received folate after developing an adverse event. Because of similar entry criteria for both studies, the data for patients with available primary outcome data at week 52 were pooled (n = 668), and the patients were grouped by folic acid use (n = 225) and nonuse (n = 443). To account for the significant between-study differences in the MTX groups, baseline covariates were adjusted using propensity scores so that folic acid users could be matched with nonusers. This allowed for a comparison of differences in American College of Rheumatology (ACR) 20% improvement criteria at week 52. RESULTS: At study entry, non-folic acid users had a significantly lower mean body weight, shorter mean RA duration, and higher mean disease activity (measured by joint counts, patient's and physician's global assessments, and acute-phase reactant levels). The mean MTX dosage at week 52 was similar in the 2 RCTs. Using propensity score matching techniques, the proportion of patients achieving an ACR 20% response at week 52 averaged 17% higher in the non-folic acid group than in the folic acid group (range 15-21%). Similarly, the proportion of patients achieving ACR 50% and ACR 70% responses averaged 14% (range 12-16%) and 12% (range 9-14%) higher, respectively, in the non-folic acid group. Adverse events were reported in 93% of US study patients and 94% of the multinational study patients. Elevated liver transaminase levels (above the upper limit of normal) were reported in 29% of the US study patients (majority receiving folic acid) and 62% of the multinational study patients (majority not receiving folic acid). CONCLUSION: After using propensity scores to adjust for differences in the baseline characteristics of folic acid users and non-folic acid users, 9-21% fewer MTX-treated RA patients taking folic acid had ACR 20%, 50%, or 70% improvement at 52 weeks compared with those who did not receive folic acid in the 2 phase III RA clinical trials. As a post hoc analysis, the results of this data analysis should be considered \"hypothesis generating\" and an impetus for future studies regarding the effects of folic acid on the efficacy of MTX in RA.",

These agents are used in the treatment of cancer, as well as for other conditions, such as rheumatoid arthritis. High-dose cancer treatment protocols can induce a state of acute folate depletion which may lead to significant treatment-related toxicity. Polymorphisms in folate-metabolizing enzymes may modify the therapeutic effectiveness and toxicity of these drugs. This review briefly summarizes the drugs targeting the folate pathway and describes common polymorphisms in folate-metabolizing enzymes and transport proteins. Pharmacogenetic studies investigating folate-related drug targets in the treatment of colorectal cancers and hematologic malignancies will subsequently be discussed. Findings to date illustrate a potential for targeting therapy based on patients' genotypes, in order to improve outcomes and reduce toxicity. However, larger, well-designed studies are needed to confirm these early findings. [References: 115]",

METHODS: Patients with active RA were randomly assigned to open treatment with GST or MTX. Clinical and laboratory assessment was performed at 0, 12, 24, and 48 weeks. Results were analysed on an intention to treat basis. RESULTS: 141 patients were recruited-72 were randomly allocated to GST and 69 to MTX. There were no statistically significant differences found in either the clinical or demographic variables at baseline. At 48 weeks 31 (43%) patients continued to receive GST and 43 (62%) MTX. The median MTX dose achieved was 10 mg. Gold caused significantly more withdrawals for toxicity (43% GST v 19% MTX, p=0.0026, log rank test). Both groups experienced a significant improvement in erythrocyte sedimentation rate, C reactive protein, Ritchie Articular Index, and pain score by 24 weeks (p<0.001, Friedman test). Although a trend towards an improved Health Assessment Questionnaire (HAQ) score and global wellbeing was seen in both groups, this did not reach statistical significance. No differences in efficacy were found when the two groups were compared (Mann-Whitney). CONCLUSION: GST and low dose MTX showed equivalent efficacy, but toxicity was more common in patients treated with GST. GST, although more toxic, remains a useful alternative for patients in whom MTX is contraindicated.",

METHODS: A double blind, placebo controlled trial lasting one year was conducted at one academic medical center. A total of 79 patients taking low dose MTX were followed up to one year. The patients were randomized to receive placebo or 5 or 27.5 mg folic acid supplementation per week. RESULTS: Plasma and erythrocyte folate levels and plasma homocysteine levels were determined. The folate nutriture of patients taking low dose MTX declined without folic acid supplementation. Plasma homocysteine levels increased significantly over a one year period in the placebo group. Low folate nutriture and hyperhomocysteinemia occurred with greater frequency in the placebo group than in the folic acid supplemented groups. CONCLUSION: For longterm, low dose MTX therapy, there are now at least 3 reasons to consider supplementation with folic acid (a low cost prescription): (1) to prevent MTX toxicity, (2) to prevent or treat folate deficiency, and (3) to prevent hyperhomocysteinemia, considered by many investigators to be a risk factor for cardiovascular disease.",

        "Abstract":"OBJECTIVES: The folate antagonist methotrexate (MTX) has become established as the most commonly used disease-modifying anti-rheumatic drug (DMARD) in the treatment of rheumatoid arthritis (RA) but is commonly discontinued due to adverse effects. Adverse effects are thought to be mediated via folate antagonism. In this paper we summarize the current data on the use of folates as a supplement to MTX use in RA for the prevention of adverse effects and as a potential modulator of cardiovascular risk, and propose guidelines for standard practice. METHODS: A Medline search was performed using the search terms \"methotrexate\", \"folic acid\", \"folinic acid\", \"folate\" and \"homocysteine\". Literature relevant to the use of folates as a supplement to MTX in the treatment of RA was reviewed and other papers referred to as references were explored. RESULTS: The use of supplemental folates, including folic and folinic acid, in RA patients treated with MTX has been shown to improve continuation rates by reducing the incidence of liver function test abnormalities and gastrointestinal intolerance. Folate supplements do not appear to significantly reduce the effectiveness of MTX in the treatment of RA. Furthermore, supplemental folic acid offsets the elevation in plasma homocysteine associated with the use of MTX. This may in turn reduce the risk of cardiovascular disease, which is over-represented amongst patients with RA, and for which hyperhomocysteinaemia is now recognized as an independent risk factor. CONCLUSIONS: We propose that folic acid supplements be prescribed routinely to all patients receiving MTX for the treatment of RA. We recommend a pragmatic dosing schedule of 5 mg of oral folic acid given on the morning following the day of MTX administration. [References: 39]",

        "Abstract":"Three-dimensional (3D) volumetric ultrasonography (US) is an interesting tool that could improve the traditional approach to musculoskeletal US in rheumatology, due to its virtual operator independence and reduced examination time. The aim of this study was to investigate the performance of 3DUS in the detection of bone erosions in hand and wrist joints of early rheumatoid arthritis (ERA) patients, with computed tomography (CT) as the reference method. Twenty ERA patients without erosions on standard radiography of hands and wrists underwent 3DUS and CT evaluation of eleven joints: radiocarpal, intercarpal, ulnocarpal, second to fifth metacarpo-phalangeal (MCP), and second to fifth proximal interphalangeal (PIP) joints of dominant hand. Eleven (55.0%) patients were erosive with CT and ten of them were erosive also at 3DUS evaluation. In five patients, 3DUS identified cortical breaks that were not erosions at CT evaluation. Considering CT as the gold standard to identify erosive patients, the 3DUS sensitivity, specificity, PPV, and NPV were 0.9, 0.55, 0.71, and 0.83, respectively. A total of 32 erosions were detected with CT, 15 of them were also observed at the same sites with 3DUS, whereas 17 were not seen on 3DUS evaluation. The majority of these 3DUS false-negative erosions were in the wrist joints. Furthermore, 18 erosions recorded by 3DUS were false positive. The majority of these 3DUS false-positive erosions were located at PIP joints. This study underlines the limits of 3DUS in detecting individual bone erosion, mostly at the wrist, despite the good sensitivity in identifying erosive patients.",

        "Published":"2017 May",
        "Abstract":"PURPOSE: Methotrexate (MTX) is one of the most widely used disease-modifying antirheumatic drugs for the treatment of rheumatoid arthritis (RA). However, its efficacy in RA patients is variable and unpredictable. Methylene tetrahydrofolate reductase (MTHFR) is an important enzyme in the MTX pathway and is involved in folate metabolism and DNA synthesis. Several studies have examined the association between the MTHFR C677T polymorphism and MTX toxicity and efficacy in RA, but their conclusions remain controversial. MATERIALS AND METHODS: We conducted a comprehensive literature search of the PubMed, Embase, and Cochrane Library databases to identify studies reporting an association between the MTHFR C677T single nucleotide polymorphism and MTX response in RA patients. RESULTS: We identified 16 studies reporting MTX efficacy in 2373 RA cases, and 25 studies reporting MTX toxicity in 4063 RA cases. The pooled data analysis indicated that the MTHFR C677T polymorphism was associated with increased toxicity, but not efficacy, of MTX in RA patients. Further stratification based on ethnicity revealed an association between the MTHFR 677TT genotype and overall MTX toxicity in East Asian and Caucasian patient populations. In addition, RA patients with the MTHFR C677T polymorphism who were supplemented with folic acid displayed significantly elevated risk for MTX toxicity. CONCLUSION: Our study indicated that the MTHFR C677T polymorphism could be used as a predictor of MTX toxicity in RA patients. However, large randomized prospective studies will be required to effectively replicate and validate these findings.",

        "Abstract":"OBJECTIVES: The aim of this study was to assess how the management of rheumatoid arthritis (RA) with methotrexate (MTX) in Italy is adherent to current national recommendations. METHODS: We performed a cross-sectional and retrospective analysis of data collected from the MARI study, a multicentre survey on Italian patients with RA on treatment with MTX for at least 12 months. Retrospective data included patient's clinical history, previous treatment with MTX, screening tests performed before MTX prescription. Cross-sectional data were collected about current treatment with MTX, concomitant medications, and disease activity. Each proposition of the 2013 Italian recommendations on the use of MTX in RA was reformulated in terms of audit criteria, and adherence to provided indications was evaluated for every patient. RESULTS: Among the 1336 included patients, less than 40% had started treatment with MTX within 3-6 months from the diagnosis and nearly 30% of them were prescribed with an initial dose of MTX between 12.5 and 15 mg\/week. Screening for HBV and HCV infection as well as chest x-ray was performed in a proportion of patients around 60% and more than 90% of them underwent lab tests before MTX prescription and regularly throughout the treatment. Folic acid supplementation was given at recommended dosages in a high proportion of patients. CONCLUSIONS: Our survey showed a good adherence of Italian rheumatologists to recommendations regarding safety issues with MTX in RA, but a suboptimal approach in terms of time and dosage of the treatment in the early phases of the disease.",

Methylenetetrahydrofolate reductase (MTHFR) is involved in folate metabolism and has been shown to be polymorphic, affecting the enzyme activity. METHODS: To examine the association between 677C>T and 1298A>C MTHFR polymorphisms and MTX efficacy in the treatment of RA, a total of 174 RA patients, treated with MTX plus methylprednisone 4 mg and folic acid 5 mg were analyzed. RESULTS: In univariate regression analysis model, the MTHFR 677T allele was associated with significantly higher frequency of remission, whereas in the case of the 1298C allele, a tendency for higher remission rate was observed. In multivariate regression analysis, the presence of both 677T and 1298C alleles was associated with an increased frequency of remission. CONCLUSION: The results of our study suggest that the MTHFR 677T and 1298C alleles may be associated with an increased rate of RA remission in patients treated with MTX receiving high doses of folic acid supplementation.",

        "Abstract":"OBJECTIVES: To compare the efficacy and safety of innovator infliximab (INX) and CT-P13, an INX biosimilar, in active rheumatoid arthritis patients with inadequate response to methotrexate (MTX) treatment. METHODS: Phase III randomised, double-blind, multicentre, multinational, parallel-group study. Patients with active disease despite MTX (12.5-25 mg\/week) were randomised to receive 3 mg\/kg of CT-P13 (n=302) or INX (n=304) with MTX and folic acid. The primary endpoint was the American College of Rheumatology 20% (ACR20) response at week 30. Therapeutic equivalence of clinical response according to ACR20 criteria was concluded if the 95% CI for the treatment difference was within +\/-15%. Secondary endpoints included ACR response criteria, European League Against Rheumatism (EULAR) response criteria, change in Disease Activity Score 28 (DAS28), Medical Outcomes Study Short-Form Health Survey (SF-36), Simplified Disease Activity Index, Clinical Disease Activity Index, as well as pharmacokinetic (PK) and pharmacodynamic (PD) parameters, safety and immunogenicity. RESULTS: At week 30, ACR20 responses were 60.9% for CT-P13 and 58.6% for INX (95% CI -6% to 10%) in the intention-to-treat population. The proportions in CT-P13 and INX groups achieving good or moderate EULAR responses (C reactive protein (CRP)) at week 30 were 85.8% and 87.1%, respectively. Low disease activity or remission according to DAS28-CRP, ACR-EULAR remission rates, ACR50\/ACR70 responses and all other PK and PD endpoints were highly similar at week 30. Incidence of drug-related adverse events (35.2% vs 35.9%) and detection of antidrug antibodies (48.4% vs 48.2%) were highly similar for CT-P13 and INX, respectively. CONCLUSIONS: CT-P13 demonstrated equivalent efficacy to INX at week 30, with a comparable PK profile and immunogenicity. CT-P13 was well tolerated, with a safety profile comparable with that of INX.

        "Abstract":"Immunosuppressive drugs have been used during the last 30 years in treatment of patients with severe rheumatoid arthritis. The drugs commonly used are cyclophosphamide and chlorambucil (alkylating agents), azathioprine (purine analogue), and methotrexate (folic acid analogue). There is evidence that all four immunosuppressive drugs can reduce synovitis, but disease activity almost always recurs after therapy is stopped. Since adverse reactions are frequent, less than 50 percent of patients are able to continue a particular drug for more than one year. Since it takes three to 12 months to achieve maximal effects, those patients who are unable to continue the drug receive little benefit from it. Patients treated with alkylating agents have an increased risk of development of acute nonlymphocytic leukemia, and both alkylating agents and azathioprine are associated with the development of non-Hodgkin's lymphoma. Cyclophosphamide therapy increases the risk of carcinoma of the bladder. There have been several long-term studies of patients with rheumatoid arthritis treated with azathioprine and cyclophosphamide and the incidence of most of the common cancers is not increased. Data on the possible increased risk of malignancy in rheumatoid arthritis are still being collected, and until further information is available, the use of immunosuppressive drugs, particularly alkylating agents, in the treatment of rheumatoid arthritis should be reserved for patients with severe progressive disease or life-threatening complications.",

        "Abstract":"OBJECTIVE: To investigate the distribution of the A2756G polymorphism of the methionine synthase reductase (MTR) gene in patients with rheumatoid arthritis (RA) treated with methotrexate (MTX) compared with a healthy control group; and to examine the relationships among the A2756G polymorphism, plasma total homocysteine (tHcy), serum folate and vitamin B12 levels, disease activity, and MTX toxicity in patients with RA. METHODS: A cross-sectional study was performed on 86 MTX-treated RA patients, consisting of a clinical interview and physical examination to determine disease activity and MTX-related adverse reactions. Genotype analysis of the MTR gene was performed. Fasting plasma tHcy, serum folate, and vitamin B12 levels were measured. Allele and genotype distributions were compared to a healthy control group. RESULTS: The frequency of the 2756GG genotype (16.3%) in the RA study group was higher than that expected in the general population (3.6%; p < 0.000001). This genotype was associated with MTX-induced accelerated rheumatoid nodulosis (MIARN). No association of disease activity variables or plasma homocysteine with MTR A2756G polymorphisms was observed. The MTR 2756GG genotype, low plasma vitamin B12 levels, and the presence of rheumatoid nodules predicted MIARN. No association of nodulosis with any other indicator of disease activity or medical treatment was found. CONCLUSION: In our population of MTX-treated RA patients the 2756GG genotype of the MTR gene was more common than expected and was associated with MIARN.",

METHODS: An economic evaluation, performed alongside a randomized, double blind, placebo controlled trial with followup of 48 weeks. Patients started MTX with placebo (n = 137), folic acid (n = 133), or folinic acid (n = 141). Outcome measures were drug survival and quality-adjusted life-years (QALY), measured with the EuroQol questionnaire. Both medical and nonmedical costs were analyzed. RESULTS: Drug survival after 48 weeks was 60% for placebo, 81% for folic acid, and 87% for folinic acid. QALY during a 48 week period were 0.55 (95% CI 0.52-0.58) in the placebo group, 0.55 (95% CI 0.52-0.58) in the folic acid group, and 0.58 (95% CI 0.56-0.60) in the folinic acid group.

        "Abstract":"OBJECTIVE: To compare folic acid (FA) levels in patients being treated with methotrexate (MTX) with those of untreated patients in order to investigate potential folate depletion by MTX and its possible relationship to the drug's efficacy. METHODS: In 33 patients on low-dose MTX therapy and in 24 controls, FA and cyanocobalamin (B12) levels were determined in serum and red blood cells (RBC). In addition, MTX levels in the RBC and serum were measured, and clinical and laboratory measures of disease activity were evaluated. RESULTS: MTX treated patients had lower FA levels than controls (median 4.36 vs 7.37 ng\/ml, p < 0.001). A significant correlation between serum FA and MTX\/RBC (p < 0.01) and between the weekly dose and MTX\/RBC (p < 0.01) was seen. There was apparently no correlation between FA and the cumulative total MTX. MTX patients had lower B12\/RBC levels than the controls (p < 0.001); the serum levels of B12 were not different. Clinical features, ESR and CRP did not correlate with FA, B12 or MTX levels. CONCLUSIONS: The degree of folate depletion during MTX therapy depends primarily upon the weekly administered dose. Folate depletion may be related to B12 deficiency in RBC. Since FA levels were not related to parameters of disease activity it is conceivable that MTX does not exert its action in RA primarily by inhibiting dihydrofolatereductase. Therefore, additional folate compounds, if necessary, should not lead to a reduction in the efficacy of MTX.",

METHODS: Side effects were recorded monthly, RCF levels were measured by lactoglobulin binding radioassays, and 8 variables for disease activity were measured in a placebo controlled double blind trial of 28 weeks' duration comparing efficacy of MTX (n = 23) and D-penicillamine (n = 23). RESULTS: From Week 20 RCF levels decreased only in the MTX group (p < 0.02), and 5 MTX treated patients withdrew due to side effects. Withdrawals had lower RCF values at Weeks 0 and 9 compared to the remaining patients (p < 0.05). Folate deficiency evolved in 5 patients; 2 of these developed cytopenia. Aberrations in the scheduled dosage increase were related to lower pretreatment values of RCF (p = 0.007). Side effect scores were inversely correlated to RCF values at Weeks 0, 9, and 28 (p < 0.05). RCF levels measured concomitantly with liver enzyme elevation were lower than the remaining values (p < 0.001). When side effects were reported, 96% of concomitantly measured RCF values were below 800 nmol\/l. RCF values at entry did not correlate to improvement in any variable for disease activity, or a graded overall improvement. CONCLUSION: RCF levels decrease during MTX treatment and relate to side effects, withdrawals, liver enzyme elevations and aberrant MTX dosage increase, but not to the therapeutic effect. RCF above 800 nmol\/l protects against side effects.",

        "Abstract":"BACKGROUND: Methotrexate (MTX) treatment in rheumatoid arthritis (RA) has been associated with lower cardiovascular risk compared to other disease-modifying antirheumatic drugs (DMARDs). We sought to identify whether the MTX-associated cardioprotection involves changes in blood pressure (BP) and\/or arterial function. METHODS: Clinic and 24-hour peripheral and central systolic and diastolic BP (SBP and DBP), augmentation index (AIx), pulse wave velocity (PWV) and plasma asymmetric dimethylarginine (ADMA) were assessed in RA patients on stable treatment with either MTX +\/- other DMARDs (MTX group, n = 56, age 61 +\/- 13 years, 70% females) or other DMARDs (non-MTX group, n = 30, age 63 +\/- 12 years, 76% females). Measurements were performed at baseline and after 8 months. RESULTS: After adjusting for visit, age, gender, body mass index, folic acid use and 28-joint disease activity score, the MTX group had significantly lower clinic peripheral SBP (-7.7 mmHg, 95% CI -13.2 to -2.3, p = 0.006) and DBP (-6.1 mmHg, 95% CI -9.8 to -2.4, p = 0.001) and clinic central SBP (-7.8 mmHg, 95% CI -13.1 to -2.6, p = 0.003) and DBP (-5.4 mmHg, 95% CI -9.1 to -1.6, p = 0.005) versus the non-MTX group. Furthermore, the MTX group had significantly lower 24-hour peripheral and central SBP and DBP and PWV versus the non-MTX group (p < 0.01 for all comparisons). By contrast, there were no significant between-group differences in AIx and ADMA. CONCLUSIONS: RA patients on MTX treatment had significantly lower clinic and 24-hour peripheral and central BP compared to those who did not take MTX. The lower BP with MTX may be related to differences in PWV, but not in AIx or ADMA concentrations. Further longitudinal studies including randomized controlled trials are warranted to confirm these findings, to identify other possible mechanisms responsible for the effects of MTX on BP and PWV, and to establish whether these effects might account for the reduced cardiovascular risk with MTX.",

        "Abstract":"OBJECTIVES: Methotrexate (MTX) is the cornerstone medication in the treatment of rheumatoid arthritis (RA). We examined whether single nucleotide polymorphisms (SNPs) in enzymes of the folic acid pathway (folylpoly-gamma-glutamate synthetase [FPGS], gamma-glutamyl hydrolase [GGH], and methylenetetrahydrofolate reductase [MTHFR]) associate with significant adverse events (SigAE). METHODS: Patients (n=319) enrolled in the Veterans Affairs RA (VARA) registry taking MTX were genotyped for HLA-DRB1-SE and the following SNPs: FPGS (rs7033913, rs10760503, rs10106), GGH (12548933, rs7010484, rs4617146, rs719235, rs11988534), MTHFR (rs1801131, rs1801133). AE were abstracted from the medical record using a structured instrument. SigAE were defined as an AE leading to MTX discontinuation. Covariates included: age, gender, race, RA antibody status, tobacco, RA disease duration between diagnosis and MTX course, Charlson-Deyo comorbidity index, glucocorticoids, use of prior RA medications, and mean 4-variable disease activity score. Cox regression was performed to determine factors associated with time-to-SigAE. A p-value <= 0.005 established significance in the final model. RESULTS: The presence of >= 1 copy of the minor allele in MTHFR rs1801131 was associated with an increased hazard ratio (HR) of SigAE (HR 3.05, 95% CI 1.48-6.29, p-value 0.003 and HR 3.88, 95% CI 1.62-9.28, p-value 0.002 for heterozygotes and homozygotes for the minor allele, respectively). An interaction term, between FPGS rs7033913 heterozygotes and GGH rs11988534 homozygotes for the minor allele, had a p-value <0.0001. CONCLUSIONS: RA subjects taking MTX may have decreased time-to-SigAE with >= 1 copy of the minor allele in MTHFR rs1801131. Further investigation is warranted, as these SNPs may indicate susceptibility to MTX toxicity.",

In addition, significantly lower MTX dosages, higher blood cell counts, and lower hemoglobin levels were seen in the myelosuppression group (p < 0.001). No patients exhibited leukocytopenia, neutropenia, or thrombocytopenia in routine blood monitoring taken within the past month. One-fourth developed myelosuppression within the first two months (an early-onset period). Myelosuppression was severe in approximately 40% of patients. Hypoalbuminemia and non-use of folic acid supplements were significantly associated with the severity of pancytopenia (p = 0.001 and 0.008, respectively). Besides these two factors, early onset and the use of lower doses of MTX were significantly associated with the severity of neutropenia (p = 0.003, 0.007, 0.003, and 0.002, respectively). CONCLUSIONS: Myelosuppression can occur abruptly at any time during low-dose MTX therapy, but severe neutropenia is more likely to occur in the early-onset period of this therapy. Contrary to our expectations, disease severity was not dependent on MTX doses. Serum albumin levels and folic acid supplementation are the important factors affecting the severity of MTX-related pancytopenia and neutropenia.",

        "Published":"2009 May-Jun",
        "Abstract":"OBJECTIVE: MTHFR is an enzyme involved in the folate pathway. It has been suggested that common polymorphisms in its gene (C677T and A1298C) could be related to different methotrexate (MTX) response and toxicity in rheumatoid arthritis (RA) patients. Agreement has not been found yet and there is no data on rheumatic Italian patients. The aim of this study is to determine if a genetic screening can help in planning the treatment in these patients. METHODS: We enrolled 84 Northern Italian patients affected by RA (n=79), psoriatic arthritis (n=4) and ankylosing spondylitis (n=1), who received MTX. Subjects who achieved at least ACR20 response in 6 months and maintained it during the following 6 months were defined as \"responders\"; those who did not obtain a disease control after 6 months of MTX were classified as \"non responders\". Patients who experienced MTX adverse events were defined \"with toxicity\", those who did not, as \"without toxicity\". Genotypes were determined by polymerase chain reaction. RESULTS: Genotype frequency was consistent with that reported in a healthy population from Italy. We did not find any statistically significant difference in genotype\/allele distribution between the groups. In patients receiving folic acid supplementation MTX toxicity was recorded only in 18 cases (24%), while all the 8 patients not receiving it experienced MTX adverse events (p=0.00). CONCLUSION: In our study we did not find any association between MTHFR genotype\/allele and MTX response or toxicity. At the moment there is not sufficient evidence for MTHFR screening in patients who are candidate for MTX.",

        "Published":"2010 Feb",
        "Abstract":"OBJECTIVE: There are limited data suggesting that methotrexate polyglutamate (MTXGlu) concentrations can guide MTX dosing in patients with rheumatoid arthritis (RA). The aim of this study was to define a therapeutic range of red blood cell (RBC) MTXGlu(n) concentrations (where n refers to the number of glutamate groups), including threshold values for efficacy and adverse effects in patients receiving long-term oral MTX treatment. METHODS: A cross-sectional study of 192 patients receiving oral MTX was undertaken. Disease activity was assessed by the swollen and tender joint counts, the C-reactive protein level, and the Disease Activity Score in 28 joints (DAS28). High disease activity was defined as a DAS28 of >3.2. A standardized questionnaire regarding common MTX adverse effects was completed. RESULTS: The MTX dosage was significantly higher in patients in whom the swollen joint count and DAS28 were higher. The MTXGlu(4), MTXGlu(5), MTXGlu(3-5), and MTXGlu(1-5) concentrations were significantly higher in patients with high disease activity. After correction for age, the estimated glomerular filtration rate, and the MTX dosage, the association remained significant for MTXGlu(5). RBC folate concentrations were significantly higher in the group with high disease activity. There was no association between any MTXGlu(n) concentration and adverse effects. CONCLUSION: In contrast to other studies, the results of the present study did not show a relationship between the MTXGlu(n) concentration and reduced disease activity in patients with RA who were receiving long-term MTX therapy. However, disease activity was influenced by the RBC folate level, which may be a more important factor than MTXGlu(n) concentrations for disease control. In accordance with the findings of previous studies, we were unable to show a relationship between MTXGlu(n) concentrations and adverse effects. Prospective studies will be important to determine whether there is a role for measuring MTXGlu(n) concentrations in patients receiving long-term treatment with MTX.",

        "Abstract":"OBJECTIVE: To study genetic polymorphisms in the folate pathway, a site of action of methotrexate (MTX) and sulfasalazine (SSZ), as predictors of efficacy of combination disease modifying antirheumatic drug (DMARD) regimens containing MTX and SSZ in early rheumatoid arthritis (RA). METHODS: Ninety-eight Caucasian patients with early RA received MTX with SSZ, hydroxychloroquine, and folate according to a standardized protocol. Efficacy was evaluated using the Disease Activity Score (DAS28) and European League Against Rheumatism response criteria at 12 months. Nine polymorphisms in 7 genes of the folate pathway were studied. RESULTS: Response to therapy was associated with SLC19A1, MTR, and TYMS polymorphisms. Two favorable allele combinations associated with responder status at 12 months were identified: the MTR 2756A allele in combination with either the SLC19A1 80A allele or the TYMS 3R-del6 haplotype (multivariate analysis, p = 0.0002, p = 0.009 respectively). Seventy of the 72 patients with these allele combinations responded compared to 12\/24 patients without [odds ratio (OR) 35.0, 95% confidence interval (CI) 6.9-176, p < 0.0001]. An association with remission (DAS28 < 2.6) was also observed (OR 3.4, 95% CI 1.1-10.0, p = 0.04). When analyzed over 3 years, both the change in DAS score from baseline and the final DAS scores were significantly higher and lower, respectively, with the favorable genotype group (p < 0.0001, p < 0.0001). CONCLUSION: Polymorphic variations in the MTR, SLC19A1, and TYMS genes were associated with better clinical response to combination DMARD regimens containing MTX and SSZ. Allele combinations of these genes may predict response to combination DMARD and assist in treatment decisions in patients with early RA.",

        "Published":"2006 Oct",
        "Abstract":"BACKGROUND: Methotrexate (MTX) is the current gold standard conventional disease-modifying antirheumatic drug (DMARD) and is effluxed from cells by several transmembrane proteins, including multidrug resistance protein-1 (MRP1). It is hypothesised that the overexpression of these proteins may mediate reduced efficacy of MTX. To date, it is unclear how expression of these proteins changes over time or after exposure to drugs. AIMS: To compare MRP1 expression in newly diagnosed patients with DMARD-naive rheumatoid arthritis with that in healthy controls and to investigate how MRP1 expression changed after exposure to MTX. METHODS: 18 newly diagnosed patients with DMARD-naive rheumatoid arthritis and 14 healthy controls were recruited. Peripheral blood mononuclear cell counts were taken at baseline and after 6 months' treatment with MTX. Cells were separated by density gradient centrifugation and MRP1 expression was measured using the QCRL-1 monoclonal antibody. RESULTS: MRP1 expression in patients did not seem to be up regulated compared with that in healthy controls. In patients who were positive for MRP1 at baseline (61%), treatment with MTX and folic acid led to a marked down regulation of MRP1 expression at 6 months. CONCLUSION: In patients with rheumatoid arthritis expressing MRP1, treatment with MTX and folic acid led to down regulation of MRP1 expression. Further studies are required to determine the mechanism behind this observation and whether MRP1 expression mediates altered efficacy to MTX.",

        "Abstract":"BACKGROUND: The polymorphism of thymidylate synthase (TS) gene and homocysteine are reported to have a relationship to methotrexate (MTX) metabolism, with conflicting results. The aim of this study was to determine homocysteine levels and the frequency of TS gene triple repeat (TS3R) and double repeat (TS2R) polymorphisms in a group of Turkish RA patients and evaluate its association with MTX toxicity and disease activity. METHODS: Sixty-four patients with RA and 31 control subjects with a mean age of 48.7 +\/- 12.5 and 46.2 +\/- 13.4 years, were enrolled to the study. Demographic characteristics were obtained and number of patients with MTX-related adverse affects, were recorded in the patient group. The homocysteine levels and TS2R\/TS3R polymorphisms of the TS gene were analyzed and the distribution of genotypes according to MTX toxicity and disease activity, were determined. RESULTS: The demographic properties were similar between the patient and control subjects. Folic acid supplementation with a mean dose of 5mg folic acid\/week, was present in all patients. Thirty-six of the 64 patients showed adverse effects to MTX treatment. The frequency of TS2R and TS3R polymorphisms were found to be similar in the patient and control groups. TS2R and TS3R gene polymorphisms were found to be similar in patients with and without MTX-related adverse events. The mean homocysteine level was also similar in patients with and without TS gene polymorphism, but was found to be higher (12.45mumol\/L vs 10.7mumol\/L) in patients with MTX-related side effects than in patients without side effects. The mean level of homocysteine was correlated with levels of ESR in the patient group. CONCLUSIONS: In conclusion, homocysteine levels might effect the disease activity and toxicity of MTX but 2R and 3R polymorphisms in the TS gene, were not related with MTX-related toxicity in RA patients receiving folate supplementation. Further studies are needed to illuminate the polymorphisms in other enzymes that might be responsible from the MTX toxicity in patients suffering from RA. Copyright © 2015 Elsevier Editora Ltda.

        "Published":"2017 Nov 01",
        "Abstract":"BACKGROUND: Liver enzyme elevation is an important and common adverse effect among patients with immune-mediated diseases who receive tumour necrosis factor inhibitors (anti-TNF), and has various causes. Hence, we evaluated the relative risks of developing liver enzyme elevation in anti-TNF users with differing hepatitis B virus (HBV) infection status. METHODS: At a hospital in central Taiwan, 407 patients with rheumatoid arthritis, ankylosing spondylitis, or psoriasis\/psoriatic arthritis received anti-TNF therapy between 1 January 2004 and 30 June 2012. We performed a nested case-control study (n = 368) of cases with serum alanine aminotransferase (ALT) > 40 international units\/L <= 12 months after starting anti-TNF therapy, and corresponding controls without liver enzyme elevation. Conditional logistic regression was used to evaluate associations between liver enzyme elevation and HBV serostatus, as well as other risk factors. RESULTS: Thirty cases were compared to 338 controls. After adjustment for potential confounders, HBV surface antigen-positive (HBsAg+) serostatus was associated with substantially higher likelihood of developing elevated ALT (adjusted odds ratio 7.91, 95% confidence interval (CI) 2.16-31.31) relative to those with an uninfected HBV status; no such association was observed among HBsAg-negative\/HBV core antibody-positive (HBsAg-\/HBcAb+) patients (adjusted odds ratio 1.00, 95% CI 0.33-3.25). Increased risk of ALT elevation was associated with methotrexate used alone, without folic acid (adjusted odds ratio 11.60, 95% CI 2.52-56.46), and history of ALT elevation (adjusted odds ratio 13.71, 95% CI 4.32-45.75). CONCLUSIONS: HBsAg+ patients with immune-mediated diseases who received anti-TNF therapy had an approximately eight-fold higher likelihood of liver enzyme elevation than those without HBV infection, whereas patients with HBsAg-\/HBcAb+ serostatus had a risk similar to that of uninfected patients.",

Patients on methotrexate had a significantly reduced intake of folic acid as a percentage of RDI (P < .05) compared with those on other therapies. In contrast, dietary intake of iron and protein was largely adequate and unrelated to anemia.

        "Abstract":"Background: The temporal relationship between arterial stiffness and blood pressure (BP) may vary depending on age and other clinical and demographic factors. Since both BP and arterial stiffness are also affected by inflammatory processes, we examined the temporal arterial stiffness-BP relationship in patients with rheumatoid arthritis (RA) treated with either methotrexate (MTX), an anti-rheumatic agent shown to reduce cardiovascular risk in meta-analyses, or other disease-modifying anti-rheumatic drugs (DMARDs). Methods: Measurements of clinic and 24-h peripheral and central systolic and diastolic BP (SBP and DBP), and pulse wave velocity (PWV) were assessed in RA patients on stable treatment with either MTX +\/- other DMARDs (MTX group, n = 41, age 61 +\/- 14 years, 73% females) or other DMARDs (non-MTX group, n = 18, age 65 +\/- 13 years, 89% females). Measurements were performed at baseline and after 8 months. The temporal relationships were examined using cross-lagged path analysis with models that included age, sex, body mass index, prednisolone, and folic acid use and 28-joint disease activity score. Results: There were significant differences in the temporal arterial stiffness-BP relationships between those in the MTX and DMARD groups. A higher PWV at baseline caused a significant increase in 6 out of 8 different measures of SBP at 8 months amongst those treated with DMARDs (standardized beta, range = 0.54-0.66, p < 0.003 for each) and 3 out of 8 different measures of DBP (standardized beta, range = 0.52-0.61, p < 0.003 for each) but was not associated with either SBP or DBP at 8 months amongst those treated with MTX. The difference in the effect of baseline PWV on 8-month BP between the 2 groups was also significant (p < 0.003) for 4 measures including clinic peripheral SBP (beta = 7.0, 95% CI = 2.8-11.1 mmHg per 1 m\/s higher baseline PWV; p < 0.001). Conclusions: Higher arterial stiffness preceded increases in BP in subjects with RA treated with DMARDs, but these effects did not occur amongst those treated with MTX. The different effects were seen mostly in measures of SBP but were also present in some measures of DBP. Our findings suggest MTX may confer a protective effect against stiffness mediated increases in BP in patients with RA.",

        "Published":"2007 Dec",
        "Abstract":"Aminopterin (AMT), like the related compound methotrexate (MTX), is a drug with anticancer and antiinflammatory efficacy that works by interfering with synthetic reactions dependent on the vitamin folic acid. Red blood cell (RBC) precursors will accumulate antifolates like AMT and MTX through the same mechanism by which they take up folate. Intracellular folate and antifolates are then metabolized to polyglutamates that remain within the mature RBCs. RBC MTX has been correlated with toxicity and\/or treatment efficacy among patients with acute lymphoblastic leukemia (ALL) or rheumatoid arthritis. Because AMT may offer clinically relevant advantages over MTX, we are testing whether it can be administered safely in multiagent therapy to children with ALL. Total RBC AMT was measured to monitor compliance with this oral, outpatient regimen, and to estimate AMT exposure to the bone marrow. Here we describe methods for quantifying each AMT-polyglutamate species within the RBCs of patients. The assay was linear over a concentration range of 62.5-500 nmol\/L. Recovery of individual AMT-polyglutamates ranged from 85% to 92%, and the intraday coefficients of variation were 1.3% to 3.6%. Long-chain AMT-polyglutamates (triglutamate and tetraglutamate forms) accounted for over 40% of intracellular AMT within the RBCs of patients. Patients with long-chain AMT polyglutamate concentrations above the median tended to have lower mean neutrophil counts during weekly AMT therapy, which suggests that RBC AMT polyglutamate accumulation may correlate with hematologic toxicity. As AMT continues to be tested in clinical trials, the methods described here will be useful to define relationships between clinical response to AMT and RBC accumulation of AMT-polyglutamates.",

        "Published":"2005 Feb",
        "Abstract":"BACKGROUND: Methotrexate (MTX) is a folate analogue used in the treatment of moderate to severe psoriasis and rheumatoid arthritis (RA). It oppositely affects inflammation and hyperhomocysteinemia-two independent risk factors for vascular disease. To date, there are no published reports evaluating the impact of these potentially paradoxical action of MTX. OBJECTIVE: The purpose of this study was to evaluate the effect of MTX therapy on the incidence of vascular disease in patients with psoriasis and RA. METHODS: We conducted a retrospective cohort study in which we analyzed computerized records of 7,615 outpatients diagnosed with psoriasis and 6,707 with RA at the Veterans Integrated Service Network 8. RESULTS: Patients prescribed MTX therapy had a significantly reduced risk of vascular disease compared to those who were not prescribed MTX (psoriasis: RR = 0.73, 95% CI = 0.55-0.98; RA: 0.83, 0.71-0.96). This reduction was most evident for patients prescribed a low cumulative dose of MTX (psoriasis: RR = 0.50, 95% CI = 0.31-0.79; RA = 0.65, 0.52-0.80). Concomitant use of folic acid (FA) with MTX also reduced the incidence of vascular disease in patients prescribed MTX (psoriasis: RR = 0.56, 95% CI = 0.39-0.80; RA: 0.77, 0.38-1.56). CONCLUSIONS: MTX therapy reduced the incidence of vascular disease in veterans with psoriasis or RA. Low to moderate cumulative dose appears more beneficial than the higher dose. We hypothesize that this effect is caused by its anti-inflammatory properties. In addition, a combination of MTX and FA led to a further reduction in the incidence of vascular disease.

        "Abstract":"OBJECTIVE: To determine associations of methotrexate (MTX) efficacy and toxicity with single-nucleotide polymorphisms (SNPs) in genes coding for folate pathway enzymes in patients with early rheumatoid arthritis (RA). METHODS: Patients (n=205) with active RA received MTX at an initial dosage of 7.5 mg\/week, which was increased to 15 mg\/week and combined with folic acid (1 mg\/day) after 4 weeks. If the Disease Activity Score in 44 joints (DAS44) was >2.4 at 3 months, MTX was increased to 25 mg\/week. MTX efficacy was evaluated at 3 and 6 months and compared for genotypes in 3 analyses: patients with and without good response (DAS44<or=2.4), patients with and without good improvement (DeltaDAS44>1.2), and patients with and without moderate improvement (DeltaDAS44>0.6). The association between MTX-related adverse drug events (ADEs) and genotype was evaluated by comparing genotypes between patients with and without ADEs, specifically pneumonitis, gastrointestinal ADEs, skin and mucosal ADEs, and elevated liver enzyme levels. The following SNPs were analyzed: methylenetetrahydrofolate reductase (MTHFR) 677C>T, MTHFR 1298A>C, dihydrofolate reductase (DHFR) -473G>A, DHFR 35289G>A, and reduced folate carrier 80G>A. In case of significant differences, odds ratios (ORs) were calculated. RESULTS: At 6 months, MTHFR 1298AA was associated with good improvement relative to 1298C (OR 2.3, 95% confidence interval [95% CI] 1.18-4.41), which increased with increased copies of the MTHFR 677CC haplotype. In contrast, MTHFR 1298C allele carriers developed more ADEs (OR 2.5, 95% CI 1.32-4.72). CONCLUSION: Patients with MTHFR 1298AA and MTHFR 677CC showed greater clinical improvement with MTX, whereas only the MTHFR 1298C allele was associated with toxicity. In the future, MTHFR genotypes may help determine which patients will benefit most from MTX treatment.",

        "Published":"2012 Sep",
        "Abstract":"OBJECTIVE: To describe the use of MTX in early arthritis (EA) in daily clinical practice and to evaluate its 6-month symptomatic efficacy and 12-month structural efficacy. METHODS: Patients included in the French observational ESPOIR cohort were assessed. Evaluation of the symptomatic and structural efficacy was performed by generalized linear regression after adjustment on propensity score (PS) in the group of patients receiving at least 3 months of MTX vs the ones receiving any other treatment except LEF, SSZ or TNF inhibitors. RESULTS: Within the first 6 months of follow-up of 777 EA patients, 59% received a DMARD, which was MTX in 68% (N = 313) of patients. The mean dose of MTX was 12.7 +\/- 3.8 mg\/week. Only 53.7% of the patients received folic acid supplementation. MTX was initiated in patients with more active and severe disease. At 6 months, in unadjusted analysis, patients starting MTX had a significantly higher DAS-28 (3.58 vs 3.23; P = 0.001) and a significantly higher HAQ (0.60 vs. 0.48; P = 0.01) compared with controls. After adjustment by PS, there were no significant differences. Adjustment for the PS also revealed a statistically significant decrease in the radiological progression at 12 months in the MTX group [total Sharp-van der Heijde score (SHS), 1.05 +\/- 0.29 vs 2.02 +\/- 0.29, P = 0.025]. CONCLUSION: This study confirms the symptomatic and structural efficacy of MTX in EA in daily practice despite the non-optimal use of MTX, including low doses and infrequent concomitant folic acid supplementation.",

        "Published":"2017 06 10",
        "Abstract":"BACKGROUND: Dietary intake of vitamin D and omega-3 fatty acids (FA) may be associated with superior response to antirheumatic treatments. In addition, dietary folate intake may be associated with worse response to methotrexate (MTX). The aim of this study was to investigate the association between dietary vitamin D, omega-3 FA, folate and treatment results of disease-modifying antirheumatic drugs (DMARDs) in patients with rheumatoid arthritis (RA). METHODS: This prospective study was based on data from the Epidemiological Investigation of Rheumatoid Arthritis (EIRA) study, and included 727 patients with early RA from 10 hospitals in Sweden. Data on dietary vitamin D, omega-3 FA and folate intake based on food frequency questionnaires were linked with data on European League Against Rheumatism (EULAR) response after 3 months of DMARD treatment. Associations between vitamin D, omega-3 FA, folate and EULAR response were analysed with logistic regression adjusted for potential confounders. RESULTS: The majority of patients (89.9%) were initially treated with MTX monotherapy and more than half (56.9%) with glucocorticoids. Vitamin D and omega-3 FA were associated with good EULAR response (OR 1.80 (95% CI 1.14 to 2.83) and OR 1.60 (95% CI 1.02 to 2.53), respectively). Folate was not significantly associated with EULAR response (OR 1.20 (95% CI 0.75 to 1.91)). Similar results were seen in a subgroup of patients who were initially treated with MTX monotherapy at baseline. CONCLUSIONS: Higher intake of dietary vitamin D and omega-3 FA during the year preceding DMARD initiation may be associated with better treatment results in patients with early RA. Dietary folate intake was not associated with worse or better response to treatment, especially to MTX. Our results suggest that some nutrients may be associated with enhanced treatment results of DMARDs.

METHODS: All patients with RA who had started MTX after January 1, 1993, were selected from a regional hospital based registration system. Data on demographic and clinical features were retrieved through chart review. By means of life table analysis and Cox regression analysis, MTX survival and the relation between demographic variables, clinical features, and MTX survival were studied. RESULTS: A total of 1072 MTX treatment episodes in 1022 patients were analyzed. The cumulative MTX survival probability after 5 years was 64%, and after 9 years was 50%. Univariate analysis showed a significant relation between MTX survival probability and folic acid supplementation, attending rheumatologist, concurrent prednisolone use, concurrent sulfasalazine use, and the number of previous disease modifying drugs. In the multivariate analysis folic acid supplementation, attending rheumatologist, and concurrent prednisolone use remained significantly related to MTX survival.

        "Published":"2009 Mar",
        "Abstract":"BACKGROUND: Methotrexate is a folic acid antagonist widely used for the treatment of inflammatory disorders for more than 50 years. Methotrexate is a standard systemic therapy for severe psoriasis and rheumatoid arthritis. Folic acid supplementation has been advocated to limit the toxicity of methotrexate on blood cells, gastrointestinal tract and liver. However, there is still controversy regarding the usefulness of folic acid supplementation. OBJECTIVES: We sought to assess the evidence for the efficacy of folic acid supplementation in patients treated with methotrexate for inflammatory diseases. We also investigated whether folic acid supplementation may decrease the efficacy of methotrexate. METHODS: Cochrane and MEDLINE databases were systematically searched. Randomized controlled trials in patients treated with methotrexate for rheumatoid arthritis or psoriasis with or without arthritis were included. Study selection, assessment of methodological quality, data extraction and analysis were carried out by two independent researchers. We selected double-blind randomized placebo-controlled trials. Analysis was performed for each subgroup of side-effects: gastrointestinal, mucocutaneous, haematological and hepatic. RESULTS: Six randomized controlled trials met the inclusion criteria, with a total sample of 648 patients. There were 257 patients in the placebo group, 198 patients treated with folic acid, and 193 patients treated with folinic acid. The statistical analysis showed a significant reduction of 35.8% of hepatic side-effects induced by methotrexate for patients with supplementation with folic or folinic acid (95% confidence interval -0.467 to -0.248). There was no statistical difference for mucocutaneous and gastrointestinal side-effects although there was a trend in favour of supplementation. The effect of supplementation on haematological side-effects could not be assessed accurately due to a low incidence of these events in the population studied. We were unable to analyse the effect of supplementation on the effectiveness of methotrexate, as markers of activity used in each study were not comparable. CONCLUSIONS: Supplementation with folic acid is an effective measure to reduce hepatic adverse effects associated with methotrexate treatment. There is no difference between folinic acid and folic acid, but the lower cost of the latter promotes its use. [References: 23]",

        "Published":"2004 Oct",
        "Abstract":"OBJECTIVE: To determine if folinic acid supplementation during methotrexate (MTX) therapy for rheumatoid arthritis (RA) reduces both urinary 5-aminoimidazole-4-carboxamide (AICA) and urinary adenosine excretion more than does folic acid supplementation. AICA and adenosine are markers for MTX interference with purine metabolism. METHODS: Forty patients with RA who received MTX for 6 weeks were randomized to receive either daily folic acid or folinic acid supplements during an additional week of MTX therapy. Colorimetric and radioimmunocompetition assays were used to measure 24-hour urinary AICA and adenosine excretion levels, respectively. RESULTS: At the end of 6 weeks, 24-hour urinary levels of AICA, but not adenosine, were elevated as compared with baseline levels (i.e., prior to MTX therapy). Folinic acid, but not folic acid, supplementation normalized urinary AICA levels during MTX therapy. Relatively high urinary levels of AICA were correlated with reduced disease activity. No similar correlations were seen with urinary adenosine levels. CONCLUSION: The blockade of purine nucleotide biosynthesis by MTX at the AICA ribonucleotide transformylase-catalyzed step may be related to the efficacy of MTX, and this blockade is effectively relieved by folinic acid, but not by folic acid, supplementation.

        "Abstract":"AIM: To improve treatment for rheumatoid arthritis (RA), rheumatologists have embraced patient-reported outcomes; however, limited data are available on patient perceptions of treatment. Our objective was to assess the use and perceptions of methotrexate (MTX) by patients with RA (primary objective) and their rheumatologists, patient-reported adverse events (AEs) related to MTX, and patient-reported use of alcohol, folic acid and biologic agents. METHOD: Each rheumatologist completed a rheumatologist questionnaire and then asked patients with RA to complete a patient questionnaire. RESULTS: Questionnaires were completed by 46\/50 rheumatologists and 1313\/1313 patients. Patients (72% female, 38% > 10 years RA) took oral MTX regularly (72% never miss a dose) and at therapeutic doses. Most patients (79%) were currently taking MTX, but 36% of patients were on low doses (<= 10 mg\/week) and 8% intentionally and regularly did not take MTX. Most patients had a positive perception of MTX; 82% of patients considered MTX to be important; 60% preferred to continue taking MTX. Although AEs (generally mild and gastrointestinal) occurred regularly (38%) and in some patients continuously (13%), 41% of patients did not experience an AE. Patients abstained from alcohol (46%) and took folic acid (91%, but with variable dosage regimens and doses). There were 29% of patients taking biologic agent therapy; only 70% of these patients were also taking MTX. CONCLUSION: MTX was well used, well tolerated and well perceived. However, to ensure that MTX therapy is as effective as possible, rheumatologists should discuss MTX use with their patients and consider alternative strategies for some patients.

METHODS: We searched the Cochrane Library, MEDLINE, EMBASE, and US National Institutes of Health clinical trials registry from inception to March 2012. We selected all double-blind, randomized, placebo-controlled clinical trials in which adult patients with rheumatoid arthritis (RA) were treated with MTX (dose <= 25 mg\/week) concurrently with folate supplementation. We included only trials using low-dose folic or folinic acid (a starting dose of <= 7 mg weekly) because the high dose is no longer recommended or used. Data were extracted from the trials, and the trials were independently assessed for risk of bias using a predetermined set of criteria. RESULTS: Six trials with 624 patients were eligible for inclusion. Most studies had low or unclear risk of bias for key domains. The quality of the evidence was rated as \"moderate\" for each outcome as assessed by the Grading of Recommendations Assessment, Development, and Evaluation (GRADE) working group, with the exception of hematologic side effects, which were rated as \"low.\" There was no significant heterogeneity between trials, including where folic acid and folinic acid studies were pooled. For patients supplemented with any form of exogenous folate (either folic or folinic acid) while receiving MTX therapy for RA, a 26% relative (9% absolute) risk reduction was seen for the incidence of gastrointestinal side effects such as nausea, vomiting, or abdominal pain (RR 0.74, 95% CI 0.59 to 0.92; p = 0.008). Folic and folinic acid also appear to be protective against abnormal serum transaminase elevation caused by MTX, with a 76.9% relative (16% absolute) risk reduction (RR 0.23, 95% CI 0.15 to 0.34; p < 0.00001), as well as reducing patient withdrawal from MTX for any reason [60.8% relative (15.2% absolute) risk reduction, RR 0.39, 95% CI 0.28 to 0.53; p < 0.00001]. CONCLUSION: The results support a protective effect of supplementation with either folic or folinic acid for patients with RA during treatment with MTX. There was a clinically important significant reduction shown in the incidence of GI side effects and hepatic dysfunction (as measured by elevated serum transaminase levels), as well as a clinically important significant reduction in discontinuation of MTX treatment for any reason.",

However, higher doses of folic acid is used in some cases. We examined the influence of high-dose folic acid on methotrexate efficacies and safety in Japanese RA patients. Methods 502 RA patients of four hospitals prescribed methotrexate and folic acid were included. These patients were divided into two subgroups according to the threshold of folic acid dose by 5 mg\/week. Basic patient characteristics, methotrexate doses, and the efficacies or adverse effects of methotrexate were retrospectively compared between the two patient subgroups. Results The frequency of folic acid use at doses higher than 5 mg\/week was significantly different between the four hospitals (P<0.001). The prevalence of methotrexate adverse effects was not significantly different between the patients taking folic acid less and more than 5 mg\/week. However, in the lower dose methotrexate subgroup (8 mg\/week), the prevalence of patients exhibiting abnormal serum ALT concentrations in the patients using higher (>5 mg\/week) dose of folic acid was significantly higher than that in the lower (5 mg\/week) folic acid-treated subgroup (P=0.029). Folic acid dose between patients taking methotrexate less and more than 8 mg\/week was not significantly different.

        "Abstract":"Folate metabolism is the target of two major drug groups: folate antagonists (e.g., methotrexate) and thymidylate synthase inhibitors (for example, 5-fluorouracil). These agents are widely used in cancer chemotherapy, as treatment for rheumatoid arthritis, and for other conditions. The administration of these drugs in cancer chemotherapy can induce a state of acute folate depletion with sometimes life-threatening toxic sequelae. Recent studies suggest that polymorphisms in folate-metabolizing enzymes may modify the therapeutic effectiveness and toxicity of drugs targeting folate metabolism. This review briefly summarizes major drugs targeting the folate pathway and describes common polymorphisms in folate-metabolizing enzymes and transport proteins. Pharmacogenetic studies investigating the relevance of these polymorphisms with respect to patients' response to antifolate chemotherapeutic agents are discussed. Investigating genetic variability in folate metabolism in the framework of pharmacogenetics is a promising field. Findings to date illustrate the potential for targeting therapy based on patients' genotypes with improved outcomes and reduced toxicity. [References: 112]",

TS5'UTR and SHMT1 polymorphisms were associated with higher plasma levels of MTX. CONCLUSION: Polymorphisms in folate-MTX pathway genes contribute to MTX response and affect MTX concentrations in Indian RA patients. A toxicogenetic index could identify patients who develop adverse events to MTX.",

        "Published":"2005 Aug",
        "Abstract":"OBJECTIVE: To ascertain the extent of methotrexate (MTX)-related pancytopenia at the Norfolk and Norwich University Hospital (NNUH) between 1999 and 2004. METHODS: Patients were identified by a department database search, review of pharmacy records and personal communication. Pancytopenia was defined as white blood cell count (WBC) <3.5 x 10(9)\/l, haemoglobin (Hb) <11 g\/dl and platelet count <130 x 10(9)\/l. Severe pancytopenia was defined as WBC <2.0 x 10(9)\/l, Hb <10 g\/dl and platelet count <50 x 10(9)\/l. RESULTS: Twenty-five patients had MTX-induced pancytopenia. Eleven patients were taking folic acid and one folinic acid. The median dose of MTX was 12.5 mg weekly (interquartile range 5.625 mg) and median duration of treatment 36 months (interquartile range 40.5 months). The severity of pancytopenia correlated with the dose (P = 0.04). The numbers of patients with potential risk factors were: renal insufficiency, 8; pre-existing folate deficiency, 7; age >75 yr, 15; hypoalbuminaemia, 18; pre-existing infection with hip prosthesis, 1; possible drug interactions, 18; dosing errors, 1; and polypharmacy, 15. Pancytopenia was detected by routine blood monitoring in nine patients. There were seven deaths (28% mortality), five from sepsis and two from acute myeloid leukaemia. CONCLUSION: This is the largest reported individual case series of MTX-induced pancytopenia. With the increasing long-term use of MTX, it is important that patients be monitored for haematological side-effects as pancytopenia can be a late manifestation. Pharmacogenetics may hold the answer to predicting who is at risk of this potentially fatal complication of MTX.",

        "Abstract":"The use of immunosuppressive drugs in rheumatology is fairly recent, starting just after the Second World War with the introduction of the first alkylating agents in oncohematology. When it became clear that some rheumatic diseases, particularly rheumatoid arthritis and systemic lupus erythematosus, showed an immune-mediated pathogenesis, including proliferation of immunocompetent cells, an application was soon found for immunosuppressive drugs in their treatment. This review outlines the historical milestones that led to the current use of drugs belonging to the major groups of immunosuppressants, i.e. alkylating agents (cyclophosphamide), folic acid (methotrexate) and purine (azathioprine) antagonists. We will also talk about the history of cyclosporin A, the first \"selective\" immunosuppressive agent, and that of some immunoactive drugs used more recently in rheumatology, such as mycophenolate mofetil, dapson and thalidomide, is briefly described.",

METHODS: Retrospectively, for a period of 7 years (2007-2014), we studied 205 RA patients, at King Abdulaziz University Hospital (KAUH), Jeddah, Saudi Arabia. All patients used DMARDs. Pattern of use for all 6 DMARDs was almost the same among Saudis and non-Saudis with no significant difference (p>0.05) for each DMARD; MTX was the most commonly used DMARD (71-76%). RESULTS: There was no association between anti-MCV positivity and different DMARDs use. Methotrexate was used 76 times as combination, scoring the highest in this respect. There was a significant correlation (p<0.05) between Plaquenil with Methotrexate and with Sulfasalazine; Leflunomide with anti-TNF and with Prednisolone; age with Methotrexate and with Plaquenil; anti-MCV positivity with Prednisolone. Saudi\/non-Saudi status showed no correlation with all factors or drugs. There was no significant association between DMARDs and comorbidity. CONCLUSION: Similar to worldwide results, MTX was the most commonly used DMARD; with the addition of anti-TNF to increase the effect, and folic acid to minimize the side effects. In this cohort, the pattern of use for all DMARDs was similar among Saudis and non-Saudis; treatment depended neither on anti-MCV positivity nor on the presence of comorbid conditions. A study of the association of DMARDs with disease activity is recommended.",

        "Published":"2013",
        "Abstract":"Inflammation contributes to all phases of the atherothrombotic process, patients with elevated inflammatory biomarkers such as high-sensitivity C-reactive protein (hsCRP) have increased cardiovascular risk, and recent work directly implicates the interleukin-1 (IL-1) and interleukin-6 (IL-6) pathways in atherogenesis. Yet, it remains unknown whether targeted inhibition of inflammation will reduce cardiovascular event rates. To address directly this fundamental hypothesis, our research group has initiated two large-scale, randomized, placebo-controlled trials using targeted anti-inflammatory agents for the secondary prevention of myocardial infarction. The first trial, the Cardiovascular Inflammation Reduction Trial (CIRT), has been funded by the NHLBI and will evaluate whether low-dose methotrexate (target dose, 20 mg\/wk) as compared to placebo will reduce major vascular events among a group of post-myocardial infarction patients with either diabetes or metabolic syndrome, groups known to have high risk on the basis of a persistent pro-inflammatory response. CIRT is based, in part, on observational evidence of reduced vascular event rates among those treated with methotrexate in the setting of rheumatoid arthritis or psoriatic arthritis and on the ability of methotrexate to reduce TNF, IL-6, and CRP levels. The second trial, the Canakinumab Anti-Inflammatory Thrombosis Outcomes Study (CANTOS), will evaluate whether interleukin-1beta (IL-1beta) inhibition as compared to placebo can reduce rates of recurrent myocardial infarction, stroke, and cardiovascular death among stable coronary artery disease patients who remain at high vascular risk due to persistent elevations of hsCRP (_2 mg\/L) despite contemporary secondary prevention strategies. Canakinumab is a human monoclonal antibody that selectively neutralizes IL-1beta, a pro-inflammatory cytokine that plays multiple roles in the atherothrombotic process and that undergoes activation by the NLRP3 inflammasome, a process promoted by cholesterol crystals that in turn leads directly to increased production of IL-1 and IL-6. Together, CIRT and CANTOS will enroll more than 25,000 patients worldwide and provide a fundamental test of the inflammatory hypothesis of atherothrombosis.",

DESIGN: Randomized, double-blind, placebo-controlled study. PATIENTS: 79 persons between 19 and 78 years of age who fulfilled the American Rheumatism Association's criteria for rheumatoid arthritis. INTERVENTION: Participants were randomly assigned to visually identical placebo or to 5 mg or 27.5 mg of folic acid each week. MEASUREMENTS: Duration, intensity, and clinical severity of toxic events; efficacy (indices of joint tenderness and swelling and grip strength); plasma and erythrocyte folate levels; and other laboratory variables. RESULTS: Folic acid supplementation at either dose did not affect the efficacy of methotrexate therapy as judged by joint indices and patient and physician assessments of disease. Patients given folic acid supplements had lower toxicity scores than did participants given placebo (P < or = 0.001). Low blood folate levels and increased mean corpuscular volumes were associated with substantial methotrexate toxicity, whereas daily dietary intakes of more than 900 nmol (400 micrograms) of folic acid were associated with little methotrexate toxicity.

        "Abstract":"A variety of disease-modifying antirheumatic drugs (DMARDs) are available to control the clinical activity of rheumatoid arthritis (RA). Methotrexate (MTX), an analogue of folic acid and of aminopterin, is the most commonly used DMARD and is now prescribed worldwide to at least 500,000 patients with RA. The mechanism by which MTX used at a low dose modulates inflammation in RA is still unknown. Monitoring of the therapy in terms of MTX concentration in patients with RA seems not to have a significant influence on the effectiveness of the treatment. Two meta-analyses showed that MTX has one of the best efficacy\/toxicity ratios. It should be the first DMARD used in the majority of patients with RA at this time. However, a significant number of patients treated only with MTX fail to achieve optimal disease control, so there are many combinations of DMARD regimes. It is hoped that more aggressive use of conventional DMARDs and biological agents will result in less disability and a higher proportion of patients achieving remission. The therapy of RA is a dynamic process and requires maintaining a delicate balance between benefits and risks. Even with the newer biological agents, MTX continues to serve as a reference point and there is still a role for MTX in the treatment of RA patients. [References: 124]",

        "Abstract":"This study investigated whether methotrexate, by interrupting the methyl transfer function of folate, can induce genomic DNA hypomethylation in patients with inflammatory arthritis. Consecutive subjects with inflammatory arthritis (rheumatoid or psoriatic), who were taking methotrexate (n = 7) or other medications (n = 6), and control subjects, either healthy or with osteoarthritis and taking nonsteroidal anti-inflammatory agents only (n = 9) were recruited. The methylation status of genomic DNA from peripheral blood mononuclear cells was determined. Plasma levels of folate, B12, and pyridoxal-5'-phosphate (PLP), all of which are involved in biologic methylation, were also examined. The extent of genomic DNA methylation was lowest in subjects with inflammatory arthritis who were not taking methotrexate, highest in subjects with inflammatory arthritis who were taking methotrexate, and intermediate in control subjects (p < 0.05). Plasma levels of folate and B12 were similar among the three groups. The mean plasma PLP level in subjects with inflammatory arthritis was 33% lower than that in control subjects (p = 0.04). No significant correlation between genomic DNA methylation and folate, B12, and PLP levels was observed. These data do not support the hypothesis that methotrexate induces genomic DNA hypomethylation. However, these data indicate that inflammatory arthritis is associated with genomic DNA hypomethylation that is reversed with methotrexate. Future studies using a larger number of subjects are warranted to confirm these findings.",

        "Published":"2013 Nov",
        "Abstract":"OBJECTIVE: The folate antagonist methotrexate (MTX) is an anchor drug in the treatment of rheumatoid arthritis (RA), but its mechanism of action with regard to the impact on folate metabolism remains elusive. The aim of the present study was to investigate the cellular pharmacologic impact of MTX on peripheral blood cells, by comparing MTX-treated RA patients to MTX-naive RA patients and healthy controls. METHODS: Gene expression microarray data were used to investigate the expression of 17 folate pathway genes by peripheral blood cells from a cohort of 25 RA patients treated with MTX, 10 MTX-naive RA patients starting treatment with MTX, and 15 healthy controls (test cohort). Multiplex real-time polymerase chain reaction was used to validate the results in an independent cohort, consisting of 151 RA patients treated with MTX, 28 MTX-naive RA patients starting treatment with MTX, and 24 healthy controls (validation cohort). RESULTS: Multiple folate metabolism-related genes were consistently and significantly altered between the 3 groups in both cohorts. Concurrent with evidence of an immune-activation gene signature in MTX-naive RA patients, significant up-regulation of the folate-metabolizing enzymes gamma-glutamyl hydrolase and dihydrofolate reductase, as well as the MTX\/folate efflux transporters ABCC2 and ABCC5, was observed in the MTX-naive RA group compared to healthy controls. Strikingly, MTX treatment of RA patients normalized these differential gene expression levels to the levels observed in healthy controls. CONCLUSION: These results suggest that under inflammatory conditions, basal folate metabolism in the peripheral blood cells of RA patients is markedly up-regulated, and treatment with MTX restores folate metabolism to normal levels. Identification of this novel gene signature provides insight into the mechanism of action of MTX, thus paving the way for development of novel folate metabolism-targeted therapies.

        "Abstract":"OBJECTIVE: To develop a clinical pharmacogenetic model to predict the efficacy of methotrexate (MTX) in rheumatoid arthritis (RA). METHODS: Two hundred five patients with newly diagnosed RA and active disease were treated with MTX (initiated at a dosage of 7.5 mg\/week and increased to 15 mg\/week after 4 weeks) and folic acid (1 mg\/day). If the Disease Activity Score (DAS) was >2.4 at 3 months, the dosage of MTX was increased up to 25 mg\/week. Twenty-four baseline variables possibly influencing disease state and drug response were selected. In addition, 17 polymorphisms in 13 genes related to the MTX mechanism of action, purine and pyrimidine synthesis, were determined. Factors were compared between responders (defined as patients with a DAS < or = 2.4 at 6 months) and nonresponders. In case of differences, a stepwise selection procedure identified the predictors for response. A clinical score was designed by simplifying regression coefficients of the independent variables. Cutoff levels were chosen based on the clinical score, and positive and negative response rates were calculated. An evaluation of the model was performed in a second group of patients. RESULTS: The model for MTX efficacy consisted of sex, rheumatoid factor and smoking status, the DAS, and 4 polymorphisms in the AMPD1, ATIC, ITPA, and MTHFD1 genes. This prediction model was transformed into a scoring system ranging from 0 to 11.5. Scores of < or = 3.5 had a true positive response rate of 95%. Scores of > or = 6 had a true negative response rate of 86%. Sixty percent of the patients were categorized as either responders or nonresponders, whereas 32% of the patients were categorized using a nongenetic model. Evaluation of the model in 38 additional patients with RA supported the results. CONCLUSION: This study established a model for predicting the efficacy of MTX in patients with RA. This pharmacogenetic model may lead to better-tailored initial treatment decisions in patients with RA.",

RESULTS: Among 214 patients enrolled at 4 study sites, a total of 67 patients (31%) presented with a side effect (gastrointestinal event, headache, lethargy, alopecia, cough, or dyspnea). Risk genotypes associated with side effects in the central nervous system were MTHFR 677TT (OR 3.3, P < 0.01) and SHMT1 1420CC (OR 2.4, P < 0.05). ATIC 347GG was associated with gastrointestinal side effects (OR 3.0, P < 0.01), while TSER*2\/*2 (OR 5.4, P < 0.01) and SHMT1 1420CC (OR 3.2, P < 0.01) were associated with alopecia. The toxicogenetic index ranged from 0 to 3 (median 1). An index of 3 was associated with an approximately 7-fold higher likelihood of having a side effect compared with an index of 0 (P < 0.01). CONCLUSION: These data suggest that a composite index of the cumulative risk genotypes in folate-dependent enzymes may be an effective means of profiling RA patients who develop side effects to MTX.",

        "Published":"2000 Sep",
        "Abstract":"OBJECTIVE: To evaluate the effects of repeated doses of folic acid on the pharmacokinetics of methotrexate (MTX) in patients with rheumatoid arthritis. METHODS: We studied 20 patients (ages 30-78 years) who received MTX intramuscularly (10 mm\/week). MTX was administered alone or after treatment with folic acid (5 mg tablet once daily) for 13 days. Plasma samples were collected 2 and 8 h after dose intake. MTX concentrations in plasma and ultrafiltrate samples were measured by fluorescence polarization immunoassay. A Bayesian approach was used to determine individual MTX pharmacokinetic variables to minimize the number of samples collected. RESULTS: Folic acid supplementation led to reduced plasma MTX levels 2 and 8 h after MTX administration and reduced area under the plasma MTX concentration versus time curve (AUC) (about 20%; p < 0.02). Total clearance of MTX and Vd were higher when patients were also receiving folic acid than when they were taking MTX alone (p < 0.02). The plasma protein binding of MTX remains unchanged. CONCLUSION: The lower plasma MTX concentrations in patients taking folic acid supplements could be interpreted as increased cellular uptake of MTX; the folic acid supplements would promote the sequestering of MTX intracellularly. The decrease of MTX concentrations leads to reduced AUC; it is also possible that there are reduced AUC combined with increased intracellular folate levels. These results reopen the question of whether folic acid should be used immediately in all patients when MTX is begun.",

        "Abstract":"INTRODUCTION: I n order to assess the value of using the methotrexate information booklet, we conducted a single blind prospective controlled trial of the patients attending two rheumatology services. METHODS: The active-arm (n=40) used the MTX information booklet for the patients' education and the control-arm (n=38) did not. Patients' interviews were conducted over a 6-month period using an MTX-questionnaire. RESULTS: The entire active-arm patients (100%) were taking folic-acid and 32 (80%) knew the reason why they were taking folic-acid vs. [30 (79%) and 10 (26%) in the control-arm]. In the active-arm 35 (88%) knew the reason for their monthly blood tests vs. 18 (47%) in the control-arm. The entire active-arm was aware of the need for contraception use and MTX-side effects vs. 23 (60%) and 15 (40%) in the control-arm respectively. CONCLUSIONS: The use of the MTX information booklet in our cohort improved their understanding of the treatment.",

        "Published":"2011 Sep",
        "Abstract":"OBJECTIVE: To investigate the uptake of a poly(amidoamine) dendrimer (generation 5 [G5]) nanoparticle covalently conjugated to polyvalent folic acid (FA) as the targeting ligand into macrophages, and to investigate the activity of an FA- and methotrexate (MTX)-conjugated dendrimer (G5-FA-MTX) as a therapeutic for the inflammatory disease of arthritis. METHODS: In vitro studies were performed in macrophage cell lines and in isolated mouse macrophages to check the cellular uptake of fluorescence-tagged G5-FA nanoparticles, using flow cytometry and confocal microscopy. In vivo studies were conducted in a rat model of collagen-induced arthritis to evaluate the therapeutic potential of G5-FA-MTX. RESULTS: Folate-targeted dendrimer bound and internalized in a receptor-specific manner into both folate receptor beta-expressing macrophage cell lines and primary mouse macrophages. The conjugate G5-FA-MTX acted as a potent antiinflammatory agent and reduced arthritis-induced parameters of inflammation such as ankle swelling, paw volume, cartilage damage, bone resorption, and body weight decrease. CONCLUSION: The use of folate-targeted nanoparticles to specifically target MTX into macrophages may provide an effective clinical approach for antiinflammatory therapy in rheumatoid arthritis.

        "Published":"2003 Jul 01",
        "Abstract":"BACKGROUND: Oral methotrexate and folic acid are partly absorbed by a common intestinal transporter. AIM: To determine the relative bioavailability of oral low-dose methotrexate administered with and without concomitant folic acid vs. subcutaneous administration in patients with stable Crohn's disease. METHODS: Ten patients were randomized to receive their regular maintenance dose of methotrexate (15-25 mg) for three consecutive weeks: orally, orally with 5 mg folic acid or subcutaneously. Blood samples were drawn at specified intervals during 24 h, and methotrexate levels were determined by fluorescence immunoassay. Areas under the curve extrapolated to infinity (AUC infinity ) were compared between the three routes. RESULTS: The geometric mean AUC infinity values (95% confidence intervals) were 360 nmol x h\/L (301-430 nmol x h\/L), 261 nmol x h\/L (214-318 nmol x h\/L) and 281 nmol x h\/L (209-377 nmol x h\/L) per milligram of methotrexate administered for subcutaneous, oral and oral with folic acid administration, respectively (P < 0.05 and P < 0.01 for oral with folic acid and oral vs. subcutaneous administration, respectively). The geometric mean relative bioavailabilities (95% confidence intervals) were 0.73 (0.62-0.86) and 0.77 (0.60-0.99) for oral and oral with folic acid administration, respectively (difference not significant). CONCLUSIONS: In patients with stable Crohn's disease, the oral bioavailability of methotrexate is highly variable and averages 73% of that of subcutaneous administration. Concomitant folic acid has no significant effect on the bioavailability. Dose adjustments based on individual pharmacokinetic assessment should be considered when switching patients from parenteral to oral therapy.",

        "Abstract":"Various medications are used for the treatment of rheumatoid arthritis (RA). Food-drug interactions may occur with concomitant ingestion of particular food. For example, methotrexate (MTX), the anchor drug in the therapeutic strategy against RA, is an antifolate agent. Excessive presence or absence of dietary folic acid may regulate MTX metabolism, possibly leading to unexpected adverse reactions. In this review, we focus on MTX, isoniazide and calcineurin inhibitors, and the implications of potential food-drug reactions in rheumatology, suggesting the important role of nutritional evaluations in RA patients.

        "Published":"2003 May",
        "Abstract":"OBJECTIVE: To study factors associated with toxicity, final dose, and efficacy of methotrexate (MTX) in patients with rheumatoid arthritis (RA). METHODS: Data were used from a randomised clinical 48 week trial on 411 patients with RA all treated with MTX, comparing folates and placebo. Logistic regression was used to study the relation between baseline variables and various dependent factors, including hepatotoxicity (alanine aminotransferase >\/=3 x upper limit of normal), MTX withdrawal, final MTX dose >\/=15 mg\/week, and MTX efficacy. RESULTS: Addition of folates to MTX treatment was strongly related to the lack of hepatotoxicity. Next to this, high body mass index was related to the occurrence of hepatotoxicity. Prior gastrointestinal (GI) events and younger age were related to the adverse event, diarrhoea. Hepatotoxicity and GI adverse events were the main reason for MTX withdrawal, which in turn was associated with the absence of folate supplementation, body mass index, prior GI events, and female sex. Renal function (creatinine clearance >\/=50 ml\/min) was not associated with toxicity. Reaching a final dose of MTX of >\/=15 mg\/week was related to folate supplementation and the absence of prior GI events. Efficacy of MTX treatment was associated with low disease activity at baseline, male sex, use of non-steroidal anti-inflammatory drugs (NSAIDs), and lower creatinine clearance. CONCLUSIONS: MTX toxicity, final dose, and efficacy are influenced by folate supplementation. Baseline characteristics predicting the outcome of MTX treatment are mainly prior GI events, body mass index, sex, use of NSAIDs, and creatinine clearance.",

        "Published":"2001 Feb",
        "Abstract":"Rheumatoid arthritis (RA) is a systemic inflammatory disease. Along with synovial joint inflammation, extra-articular involvement is a common feature of RA. Periarticular and generalized osteoporosis are seen both as an extra-articular feature of the disease itself and due to various medications like glucocorticoids and methotrexate (MTX). In this study, we investigated the effects of oral alendronate in RA patients treated with MTX and prednisolone by comparing the effects of \"alendronate+calcium\" and \"only calcium\" on bone mineral density (BMD). Fifty RA patients classified according to American Rheumatism Association (ARA) criteria were included in the study. The control group consisted of 20 postmenopausal osteoporotic patients. The RA patients were divided randomly into two groups. All patients were started on MTX 7.5 mg\/week, 2.5-mg daily folic acid, and 7.5-mg daily prednisolone. The first group, consisting of 25 female RA patients, was also given 10-mg daily alendronate and 1000-mg daily calcium. The second group also consisted of 25 female patients and was given only 1000-mg calcium per day. The postmenopausal control group was given daily 10-mg alendronate and 1000-mg calcium. Bone mineral densities were measured by dual-energy x-ray absorptiometry (DEXA) and again at the end of the sixth month. At the end of the study, RA patients given only calcium had reduced mean BMD, and patients treated with alendronate and calcium showed increased mean BMD almost in all regions. This increase was significant in the L2 and L1-4 total regions. In postmenopausal osteoporotic patients, we saw statistically significant increases in BMD in all regions. The increase in BMD values in RA patients treated with alendronate was smaller than in those of the control group of postmenopausal osteoporosis patients. In conclusion, RA itself has a risk factor for osteoporosis in addition to the risks of the medications like corticosteroids and MTX. In the prevention and treatment of RA-associated osteoporosis, alendronate and calcium therapy is effective and well tolerated.",
