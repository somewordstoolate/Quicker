        "Published": "2005 Jan",
        "Abstract": "OBJECTIVE: To evaluate different methods of presentation and analysis of radiographic data in a rheumatoid arthritis (RA) randomized controlled trial. METHODS: A double-blind randomized controlled trial including 682 patients with active RA who were treated with methotrexate, etanercept, or a combination of the 2 drugs was used for this study. Probability plots of the change from baseline to year 1 were produced to visualize progression, and were compared with usual descriptive statistics. The primary analysis of the trial (based on annualized actual mean change from baseline in total Sharp score at 1 year, using linear imputation) was challenged using various ways of handling missing information with alternative imputation methods, and by various statistical analyses including analysis of covariance (ANCOVA) and mixed model analysis on both raw and log-transformed data. RESULTS: Probability plots provided detailed insight into the differentiated treatment effects between the 3 arms of this study. As adjuncts to formal hypothesis testing, these plots were more useful for presenting data than were summary descriptive statistics or use of preset cutoff points to define lack of progression. Additional analyses presented here support the results obtained with the per-protocol analysis that showed an advantage of the combination treatment compared with the monotherapy arms and for etanercept versus methotrexate alone. Various ways of handling missing information confirmed the robustness of the results. In addition, both ANCOVA and mixed model analyses on raw and on log-transformed data produced similar results. CONCLUSION: We suggest a panel of alternative analysis methods and alternative ways of handling missing information to verify that the radiographic results reported in an randomized controlled trial are not influenced by technical factors, such as interpolation, handling of missing data, and choice of statistical tests.",

        "Published": "2015 Jul",
        "Abstract": "BACKGROUND: Recent research suggests that genetic variants in the tumor necrosis factor receptor 2 (TNFRSF1B) gene may have an impact on susceptibility to rheumatoid arthritis (RA) and drug response. The present population-based case-control study was carried out to evaluate whether 5 tagging single-nucleotide polymorphisms (SNPs) within the TNFRSF1B gene are associated with the risk of RA and response to antitumor necrosis factor (TNF) drugs. METHODS: The study population included 1412 RA patients and 1225 healthy controls. A subset of 596 anti-TNF-naive RA patients was selected to assess the association of TNFRSF1B SNPs and drug response according to the EULAR response criteria. RESULTS: We found that carriers of the TNFRSF1Brs3397C allele had a significantly increased risk of developing RA (P=0.0006). Importantly, this association remained significant after correction for multiple testing. We also confirmed the lack of association of the TNFRSF1Brs1061622 SNP with the risk of RA in the single-SNP analysis (P=0.89), but also through well-powered meta-analyses (PDOM=0.67 and PREC=0.37, respectively). In addition, our study showed that carriers of the TNFRSF1Brs3397C\/C, TNFRSF1Brs1061622G\/G, and TNFRSF1Brs1061631A\/A genotypes had an increased risk of having a worse response to anti-TNF drugs at the level of P less than 0.05 (P=0.014, 0.0085 and 0.028, respectively). We also observed that, according to a log-additive model, carriers of the TNFRSF1Brs3397C or TNFRSF1Brs1061622G alleles showed an increased risk of having worse response to anti-TNF medications (P=0.018 and 0.0059). However, the association of the TNFRSF1Brs1061622 SNP only reached marginal significance after correction for multiple testing according to a log-additive model (P=0.0059) and it was not confirmed through a meta-analysis (PDOM=0.12). CONCLUSION: Our results suggest that the TNFRSF1Brs3397 variant may play a role in modulating the risk of RA, but does not provide strong evidence of an impact of TNFRSF1B variants in determining response to anti-TNF drugs.",

        "Published": "2006 Apr",
        "Abstract": "OBJECTIVE: This study examined the effect of abatacept, a costimulation modulator, on the health-related quality of life (HRQOL) of patients with rheumatoid arthritis (RA). METHODS: Three hundred thirty-nine patients with RA on a background of methotrexate (MTX), who participated in a multicenter, double-blind, placebo-controlled trial, were randomized to abatacept 2 mg\/kg, abatacept 10 mg\/kg, or placebo. HRQOL was assessed at pretreatment, and at 3, 6, and 12 months posttreatment using the SF-36 Health Survey (SF-36). Changes in SF-36 scores from baseline to 12 months were compared across treatment and placebo groups to examine HRQOL benefits of abatacept. A link between American College of Rheumatology improvement and changes in SF-36 scores was established to demonstrate the association between HRQOL outcomes and clinical response. RESULTS: After 12 months of treatment, patients randomized to abatacept 10 mg\/kg showed significantly better HRQOL outcomes overall versus patients randomized to placebo (MANOVA F = 4.71, p < 0.001) or to abatacept 2 mg\/kg (MANOVA F = 1.97, p = 0.05). Differences in SF-36 change scores between abatacept 10 mg\/kg and placebo groups reached statistical significance on all 8 domain scales, the 2 summary measures, and the SF-36 utility index (SF-6D). Differences in SF-36 change scores between abatacept 10 mg\/kg and abatacept 2 mg\/kg reached statistical significance on 5 of the 8 domain scales, the physical summary measure, and the SF-6D. Improvement in HRQOL was highly related to clinical response. CONCLUSION Abatacept 10 mg\/kg plus MTX demonstrated a stronger HRQOL response than placebo plus MTX. The abatacept 2 mg\/kg arm showed a very weak and transient response.",

        "Published": "2013 Sep 01",
        "Abstract": "OBJECTIVES: Evaluation of long-term safety of rituximab in rheumatoid arthritis (RA). METHODS: Pooled observed case analysis of data from patients with moderate-to-severe, active RA treated with rituximab in a global clinical trial programme. RESULTS: As of September 2010, 3194 patients had received up to 17 rituximab courses over 9.5 years (11 962 patient-years). Of these, 627 had >5 years' follow-up (4418 patient-years). A pooled placebo population (n=818) (placebo+methotrexate (MTX)) was also analysed. Serious adverse event and infection rates generally remained stable over time and multiple courses. The overall serious infection event (SIE) rate was 3.94\/100 patient-years (3.26\/100 patient-years in patients observed for >5 years) and was comparable with placebo+MTX (3.79\/100 patient-years). Serious opportunistic infections were rare. Overall, 22.4% (n=717) of rituximab-treated patients developed low immunoglobulin (Ig)M and 3.5% (n=112) low IgG levels for >=4 months after >=1 course. SIE rates were similar before and during\/after development of low Ig levels; however, in patients with low IgG, rates were higher than in patients who never developed low IgG. Rates of myocardial infarction and stroke were consistent with rates in the general RA population. No increased risk of malignancy over time was observed. CONCLUSIONS: This analysis demonstrates that rituximab remains generally well tolerated over time and multiple courses, with a safety profile consistent with published data and clinical trial experience. Overall, the findings indicate that there was no evidence of an increased safety risk or increased reporting rates of any types of adverse events with prolonged exposure to rituximab during the 9.5 years of observation.",

        "Published": "2016 Sep 09",
        "Abstract": "It is still unknown whether there is an association between the use of certolizumab pegol (CZP) in rheumatic patients and the onset of cardiac arrhythmias. We describe the cases of two patients with rheumatoid arthritis (RA) treated with CZP as the first-line biological drug and methotrexate (MTX), who developed an arrhythmic event. The first was a 60-year-old, hypertensive male smoker, the second a 66-year-old dyslipidemic female non-smoker. Both were diagnosed as having RA in 2010, and started treatment with MTX plus CZP. The first patient developed undatable atrial fibrillation, which was resistant to pharmacological treatment and electrical cardioversion. The second patient developed an atrial flutter, which was treated with a betablocker. In both cases, we set a cautious interval between two consecutive administrations of CZP and, in the first case, also reduced the dose of MTX without any worsening of RA activity. Although many studies have shown that tumor necrosis factor (TNF)-alpha plays a pathogenetic role in inducing an arrhythmogenic substrate that is apparently rescued by anti-TNF drugs, there is still a lack of conclusive data. We suggest caution in any patient developing a cardiac event (including rhythm disorders) during treatment with a conventional or biological disease-modifying anti-rheumatic drug.",

        "Published": "2001 Oct",
        "Abstract": "The observation that anti-tumor necrosis factor (anti-TNF) therapies dramatically reduce joint pain and inflammation and retard radiographic progression in rheumatoid arthritis (RA) has created a considerable amount of enthusiasm among rheumatologists and has set new treatment standards for patients with inflammatory joint disease. A central question that has emerged is whether these agents are effective in treating the seronegative spondyloarthropathies (SpA). A related question is whether second-line agents such as methotrexate (MTX) can improve axial inflammation and functional measures if administered early in disease. The SpA are a cluster of inflammatory arthridites encompassing ankylosing spondylitis (AS), psoriatic arthritis (PsA), Reiter's syndrome\/reactive arthritis (ReA), and the arthritis associated with inflammatory bowel disease. These disorders share similar clinical and immunogenetic features including axial arthritis and enthesopathy, a general predilection for males and patients positive for the MHC class I alleles, the absence of rheumatoid factor, and association with infections of the intestinal and genitourinary tracts. Reclassification of SpA based on axial or peripheral involvement may be more relevant from a pathophysiologic and therapeutic perspective than the current stratification, given the strong association between axial disease and the HLAB27 allele and the relative resistance of axial disease to conventional anti-inflammatory therapy.

        "Published": "2009 Aug 18",
        "Abstract": "BACKGROUND: Extracts of the medicinal plant Tripterygium wilfordii Hook F (TwHF) have been used in China for centuries to treat a spectrum of inflammatory diseases. OBJECTIVE: To compare the benefits and side effects of TwHF extract with those of sulfasalazine for the treatment of active rheumatoid arthritis. DESIGN: Randomized, controlled trial. A computer-generated code with random, permuted blocks was used to assign treatment. SETTING: 2 U.S. academic centers (National Institutes of Health, Bethesda, Maryland, and University of Texas, Dallas, Texas) and 9 rheumatology subspecialty clinics (in Dallas and Austin, Texas; Tampa and Fort Lauderdale, Florida; Arlington, Virginia; Duncanville, Pennsylvania; Wheaton and Greenbelt, Maryland; and Lansing, Michigan). PATIENTS: 121 patients with active rheumatoid arthritis and 6 or more painful and swollen joints. INTERVENTION: TwHF extract, 60 mg 3 times daily, or sulfasalazine, 1 g twice daily. Patients could continue stable doses of oral prednisone or nonsteroidal anti-inflammatory drugs but had to stop taking disease-modifying antirheumatic drugs at least 28 days before randomization. MEASUREMENTS: The primary outcome was the rate of achievement of 20% improvement in the American College of Rheumatology criteria (ACR 20) at 24 weeks. Secondary end points were safety; radiographic scores of joint damage; and serum levels of interleukin-6, cholesterol, cortisol, and adrenocorticotropic hormone. RESULTS: Outcome data were available for only 62 patients at 24 weeks. In a mixed-model analysis that imputed data for patients who dropped out, 65.0% (95% CI, 51.6% to 76.9%) of the TwHF group and 32.8% (CI, 21.3% to 46.0%) of the sulfasalazine group met the ACR 20 response criteria (P=0.001). Patients receiving TwHF also had significantly higher response rates for ACR 50 and ACR 70 in mixed-model analyses. Analyses of only completers showed similar significant differences between the treatment groups. Significant improvement was demonstrated in all individual components of the ACR response, including the Health Assessment Questionnaire disability score. Interleukin-6 levels rapidly and significantly decreased in the TwHF group. Although not statistically significant, radiographic progression was lower in the TwHF group. The frequency of adverse events was similar in both groups. LIMITATIONS: Only 62% and 41% of patients continued receiving TwHF extract and sulfasalazine, respectively, during the 24 weeks of the study. Long-term outcome data were not collected on participants who discontinued treatment. CONCLUSION: In patients who continued treatment for 24 weeks and could also use stable oral prednisone and nonsteroidal anti-inflammatory drugs, attainment of the ACR 20 response criteria was significantly greater with TwHF extract than with sulfasalazine.",

        "Title": "Assessment of global DNA methylation in peripheral blood cell subpopulations of early rheumatoid arthritis before and after methotrexate",
        "Published": "2015 Aug 29",
        "Abstract": "INTRODUCTION: DNA methylation is an epigenetic mechanism regulating gene expression that has been insufficiently studied in the blood of rheumatoid arthritis (RA) patients, as only T cells and total peripheral blood mononuclear cells (PBMCs) from patients with established RA have been studied and with conflicting results. METHOD: Five major blood cell subpopulations: T, B and NK cells, monocytes, and polymorphonuclear leukocytes, were isolated from 19 early RA patients and 17 healthy controls. Patient samples were taken before and 1 month after the start of treatment with methotrexate (MTX). Analysis included DNA methylation with high-performance liquid chromatography-electrospray ionization-tandem mass spectrometry-selected reaction monitoring (HPLC-ESI-MS\/MS-SRM) and expression levels of seven methylation-specific enzymes by quantitative polymerase chain reaction (qPCR). RESULTS: Disease-modifying anti-rheumatic drug (DMARD)-naive early RA patients showed global DNA hypomethylation in T cells and monocytes, together with a lower expression of DNA methyltrasnferase 1 (DNMT1), the maintenance DNA methyltransferase, which was also decreased in B cells. Furthermore, significantly increased expression of ten-eleven translocation1 (TET1), TET2 and TET3, enzymes involved in demethylation, was found in monocytes and of TET2 in T cells. There was also modest decreased expression of DNMT3A in B cells and of growth arrest and DNA-damage-inducible protein 45A (GADD45A) in T and B cells. Treatment with MTX reverted hypomethylation in T cells and monocytes, which were no longer different from controls, and increased global methylation in B cells. In addition, DNMT1 and DNMT3A showed a trend to reversion of their decreased expression. CONCLUSIONS: Our results confirm global DNA hypomethylation in patients with RA with specificity for some blood cell subpopulations and their reversal with methotrexate treatment. These changes are accompanied by parallel changes in the levels of enzymes involved in methylation, suggesting the possibility of regulation at this level.",

        "Published": "2018 10 15",
        "Abstract": "BACKGROUND: We previously identified, in newly diagnosed rheumatoid arthritis (RA) patients, networks of co-expressed genes and proteomic biomarkers associated with achieving sustained drug-free remission (sDFR) after treatment with tocilizumab- or methotrexate-based strategies. The aim of this study was to identify, within the same patients, metabolic pathways important for achieving sDFR and to subsequently study the complex interactions between different components of the biological system and how these interactions might affect the therapeutic response in early RA. METHODS: Serum samples were analyzed of 60 patients who participated in the U-Act-Early trial (ClinicalTrials.gov number NCT01034137) and initiated treatment with methotrexate, tocilizumab, or the combination and who were thereafter able to achieve sDFR (n = 37); as controls, patients were selected who never achieved a drug-free status (n = 23). Metabolomic measurements were performed using mass spectrometry on oxidative stress, amine, and oxylipin platforms covering various compounds. Partial least square discriminant analyses (PLSDA) were performed to identify, per strategy arm, relevant metabolites of which the biological pathways were studied. In addition, integrative analyses were performed correlating the previously identified transcripts and proteins with the relevant metabolites. RESULTS: In the tocilizumab plus methotrexate, tocilizumab, and methotrexate strategy, respectively, 19, 13, and 12 relevant metabolites were found, which were subsequently used for pathway analyses. The most significant pathway in the tocilizumab plus methotrexate strategy was \"histidine metabolism\" (p < 0.001); in the tocilizumab strategy it was \"arachidonic acid metabolism\" (p = 0.018); and in the methotrexate strategy it was \"arginine and proline metabolism\" (p = 0.022). These pathways have treatment-specific drug interactions with metabolites affecting either the signaling of interleukin-6, which is inhibited by tocilizumab, or affecting protein synthesis from amino acids, which is inhibited by methotrexate. CONCLUSION: In early RA patients treated-to-target with a tocilizumab- or methotrexate-based strategy, several metabolites were found to be associated with achieving sDFR. In line with our previous observations, by analyzing relevant transcripts and proteins within the same patients, the metabolic profiles were found to be different between the strategy arms. Our metabolic analysis further supports the hypothesis that achieving sDFR is not only dependent on predisposing biomarkers, but also on the specific treatment that has been initiated.

        "Published": "2017 10",
        "Abstract": "OBJECTIVE: In disease-modifying antirheumatic drug-naive patients with early rheumatoid arthritis (RA) who had achieved sustained low disease activity (a Disease Activity Score in 28 joints using the erythrocyte sedimentation rate of <=3.2 at both week 40 and week 52) after 1 year of treatment with certolizumab pegol (CZP) at a standard dose (200 mg every 2 weeks plus optimized methotrexate [MTX]), we evaluated whether continuation of CZP treatment at a standard dose or at a reduced frequency (200 mg every 4 weeks plus MTX) was superior to stopping CZP (placebo plus MTX) in maintaining low disease activity for 1 additional year. METHODS: A total of 293 patients from period 1 of our study were re-randomized 2:3:2 in period 2 to CZP at a standard dose (n = 84), CZP at a reduced frequency (n = 127), or placebo plus MTX (CZP stopped) (n = 82). The primary end point was the percentage of patients who maintained low disease activity throughout weeks 52-104 without flares. We used a hierarchical testing scheme, comparing CZP at a standard dose with CZP stopped. If P < 0.05 was achieved, then CZP at a reduced frequency was compared with CZP stopped (nonresponder imputation). RESULTS: The 293 patients from period 1 represented 36% fewer patients than projected, yielding a smaller number of patients eligible for period 2. Higher proportions of patients treated with the standard and reduced frequency regimens maintained low disease activity than those who had stopped CZP (48.8% and 53.2%, respectively, versus 39.2% [P = 0.112 and P = 0.041, respectively; nominal P value, first hierarchical test not significant]). Similar trends were observed for radiographic nonprogression (change from baseline of <=0.5 in modified Sharp\/van der Heijde score; 79.2% and 77.9% of patients, respectively, versus 70.3%) and normative physical function (Health Assessment Questionnaire disability index score of <=0.5; 71.4% and 70.6% of patients, respectively, versus 57.0%). Safety profiles were similar between all groups, with no new safety signals identified for continuing CZP to week 104. No deaths were reported. CONCLUSION: The study failed to meet its primary end point. However, there were no clinically meaningful differences between the standard and reduced frequency doses of CZP plus MTX; both controlled RA more effectively than stopping CZP.

        "Title": "Cell cycle regulation therapy combined with cytokine blockade enhances antiarthritic effects without increasing immune suppression",
        "Published": "2016 Jan",
        "Abstract": "OBJECTIVE: Biological disease-modifying antirheumatic drugs (DMARDs) that inhibit aberrant immune reactions in rheumatoid arthritis (RA) cannot induce complete remission in all patients. Combination therapies using two biological DMARDs have failed to exert additive effects and increased serious infections. We have found that cell cycle inhibition of synovial fibroblasts with cyclin-dependent kinase (CDK) inhibitors ameliorated the disease in animal models of RA without attenuating acquired immunity. The objective of this study was to determine whether a clinically well-tolerated selective CDK 4\/6 inhibitor (CDKI), palbociclib, is effective and whether combination with cytokine blockers acts additively without enhancing immune suppression. METHODS: The effects of CDKI on haematopoiesis and physical and behavioural findings in mice were evaluated. Mice with collagen-induced arthritis (CIA) were treated with CDKI, etanercept or anti-interleukin (IL)-6 receptor antibody (MR16-1) alone or with a combination of CDKI with etanercept or MR16-1. Their clinical, histological and radiographic scores, serum anti-(type II collagen (CII)) antibody levels and proliferative responses of lymph node cells to CII were determined. RESULTS: Although CDKI induced marginal myelosuppression, it was well tolerated and ameliorated CIA dose-dependently. The combinations of low-dose CDKI and either tumour necrosis factor-alpha or IL-6 blocker enhanced the antiarthritic effects additively. The addition of CDKI to either cytokine blocker did not affect the levels of anti-CII antibodies and proliferative responses of lymphocytes to CII. CONCLUSIONS: A clinically well-tolerated CDK4\/6 inhibitor exerted antiarthritic effects in this mouse model. By combining therapeutic agents targeting immune reaction and synovial proliferation, we have demonstrated for the first time that two molecular targeting treatments act additively and may not increase immune suppression.

METHODS: The present study was conducted using data from the BeSt study (Behandelstrategieen voor Reumatoide Artritis [treatment strategies for rheumatoid arthritis]), a randomized trial comparing 4 targeted (toward achievement of a Disease Activity Score [DAS] of < or =2.4) treatment strategies: sequential monotherapy (group 1), step-up combination therapy (group 2), initial combination therapy with methotrexate, sulfasalazine, and prednisone (group 3), and initial combination therapy with methotrexate and infliximab (group 4), in 508 patients with early RA. Multivariate logistic regression analysis was used to predict progressive disease (increase of Sharp\/van der Heijde score over 2 years beyond the smallest detectable change [4.6]) according to the presence or absence of the shared epitope (SE), DERAA, RF, and ACPA, with correction for other baseline characteristics. RESULTS: Progressive disease could not be predicted by presence of the SE: the odds ratio in groups 1, 2, 3, and 4, respectively, was 1.4, 2.6, 1.9, and 3.0. DERAA carriership did not protect against progressive disease (odds ratio 0.4, 1.4, 0.9, and 0.9 in groups 1, 2, 3, and 4, respectively). RF positivity and ACPA positivity predicted progressive disease in group 1 (odds ratio 4.7 [95% confidence interval 1.5-14.5] for RF and 12.6 [95% confidence interval 3.0-51.9] for ACPA), but not in groups 2-4 (for RF, odds ratio [95% confidence interval] 1.5 [0.5-4.9], 1.0 [0.3-3.3], and 1.4 [0.4-4.8] in group 2, group 3, and group 4, respectively; for ACPA, odds ratio [95% confidence interval] 3.4 [0.8-14.2], 1.7 [0.5-5.4], and 1.8 [0.5-6.8] in group 2, group 3, and group 4). CONCLUSION: In patients with early RA treated with the goal of tight control of the DAS, no significant association between HLA-DRB1 status and radiographic progression was found. RF and ACPA were predictive of progressive disease only in patients treated with sequential monotherapy. These observations suggest that effective treatment can prevent radiographic progression, even in patients with risk factors for severe damage.",

        "Abstract": "This study was performed to evaluate the effects of the TNF-alpha inhibitor etanercept on oxidation stress markers representing DNA damage, lipid peroxidation, and protein glycosylation. Twenty-two rheumatoid arthritis (RA) patients underwent etanercept treatment. The levels of serum total, urinary total, and urinary free pentosidine, which is an advanced glycation end-product (AGE), of urinary N(epsilon)-hexanoyl lysine (N(epsilon)-HEL), and of 8-hydroxy-deoxy guanosine (8-OHdG) were measured at baseline and at 3 and 6 months after the initial treatment with etanercept. Serum total and urinary total pentosidine levels were reduced at 6 months after the initial treatment with etanercept, and urinary free pentosidine levels were reduced at 3 and 6 months. Urinary N(epsilon)-HEL levels were also reduced at 3 and 6 months, and urinary 8-OHdG levels were reduced at 6 months. Serum total and urinary total pentosidine levels in RA patients correlated with the number of swelling joints and tender joints, and urinary total pentosidine levels correlated with the Disease Activity Score using 28 joints (DAS28). This study demonstrated that etanercept acts as a regulator against pentosidine formation, oxidative DNA damage, and lipid peroxidation in RA patients.",

        "Abstract": "OBJECTIVES: Rituximab (RTX) is a therapeutic option for patients with SLE or RA. We conducted a prospective, longitudinal, observational study to compare rates of RTX-related adverse events (AEs) in these two patient groups. METHODS: RTX was used in 23 patients with SLE that was refractory to conventional therapy and in 31 patients with RA that had been unsuccessfully treated with TNF-alpha inhibitors. Infusion-related and infectious AE rates were calculated for each group. RESULTS: Seven (22.5%) RA patients experienced an infusion-related reaction. These AEs involved 7\/91 (7.7%) infusions administered in the RA group. None of the 102 infusions administered to SLE patients was associated with infusion-related AEs (P = 0.038 vs RA group). The mean daily glucocorticoid dose administered during the week preceding RTX treatment in the SLE group was higher than that for the RA group [0.25 (0.2) vs 0.18 (0.14) mg\/kg, P = not significant] and significantly higher than that received by the subgroup of the seven RA patients who experienced infusion-related AEs [0.10 (0.02) mg\/kg; P = 0.0017]. Infectious AE rates were also lower (but not significantly so) in the SLE group (8.7 vs 12.9% in RA). CONCLUSIONS: Repeated cycles of RTX in combination with different immunosuppressants is a safe therapeutic option for SLE and RA patients. The lower incidence of infusion-related AEs in the SLE patients might reflect the higher dosage glucocorticoid therapy they received during the week before RTX infusion.",

        "Published": "1996 Mar",
        "Abstract": "Although factors that appear to predict long-term outcomes of rheumatoid arthritis have been identified, there is no consensus about the treatment early in the disease. To determine how French office- and hospital-based rheumatologists treat early rheumatoid arthritis, we created three clinical vignettes corresponding to different levels of severity of early rheumatoid arthritis (less than six months' disease duration). Cases 1 and 2 were relatively young patients (35 and 50 years), and Case 1 had numerous poor prognosis factors. Case 3 was 80 years of age. Rheumatologists were asked to indicate which medications they would use at presentation and after one year of a favorable or unfavorable course. The study was conducted by questionnaire (response rate, 58%). Of the 185 rheumatologists who completed the questionnaire, 81% were male and 19% female; mean age was 42 +\/- 8 years. In Cases 1 and 2, nonsteroidal antiinflammatory drugs were given by 99% of respondents; second-line drugs were prescribed at presentation by 93% of respondents in Case 1 and 86% in Case 2, and methotrexate was more likely to be used in the presence of poor prognosis factors (23% in case 1 and 7% in Case 2). In the event of an unfavorable course after one year, a larger proportion of rheumatologists prescribed glucocorticoid therapy (65% in Case 1 and 20% in Case 2), and there was a shift from \"conventional\" to \"modern\" second-line drugs, with more widespread use of methotrexate (65% in case 1 and 18% in case 2). In the 80-year-old patient, glucocorticoid therapy was used more often than nonsteroidal antiinflammatory drugs and second-line drugs (gold salts, hydroxychloroquine, sulfasalazine) were prescribed by 40% of rheumatologists at presentation and by 67% after one year of an unfavorable course; in the latter situation, methotrexate was selected in 24% of cases. In contrast to conventional recommendations, many French office- or hospital-based rheumatologists use second-line drugs very early and base their choice of medications on the estimated risk of severe disease and on the age of the patient.",

        "Published": "2016 Jan",
        "Abstract": "UNLABELLED: Tumour necrosis factor (TNF)-blocker tapering has been proposed for patients with rheumatoid arthritis (RA) in remission. OBJECTIVE: The trial aims to compare the effect of progressive spacing of TNF-blocker injections (S-arm) to their maintenance (M-arm) for established patients with RA in remission. METHODS: The study was an 18-month equivalence trial which included patients receiving etanercept or adalimumab at stable dose for >=1 year, patients in remission on 28-joint Disease Activity Score (DAS28) for >=6 months and patients with stable joint damage. Patients were randomised into two arms: maintenance or injections spacing by 50% every 3 months up to complete stop. Spacing was reversed to the previous interval in case of relapse, and eventually reattempted after remission was reachieved. The primary outcome was the standardised difference of DAS28 slopes, based on a linear mixed-effects model (equivalence interval set at +\/-30%). RESULTS: 64 and 73 patients were included in the S-arm and M-arm, respectively, which was less than planned. In the S-arm, TNF blockers were stopped for 39.1%, only tapered for 35.9% and maintained full dose for 20.3%. The equivalence was not demonstrated with a standardised difference of 19% (95% CI -5% to 46%). Relapse was more common in the S-arm (76.6% vs 46.5%, p=0.0004). However, there was no difference in structural damage progression. CONCLUSIONS: Tapering was not equivalent to maintenance strategy, resulting in more relapses without impacting structural damage progression. Further studies are needed to identify patients who could benefit from such a strategy associated with substantial cost savings.

        "Published": "2018",
        "Abstract": "OBJECTIVE: Randomised controlled trials (RCTs) have shown tocilizumab (TCZ) administered intravenously or subcutaneously with conventional synthetic disease-modifying antirheumatic drugs (csDMARDs) to be superior to csDMARDs alone for improving rheumatoid arthritis (RA) disease activity. This study evaluated the effect of TCZ-intravenous and TCZ-subcutaneous on patient-reported outcomes (PROs) in three RCT populations. METHODS: OPTION (NCT00106548), BREVACTA (NCT01232569) and SUMMACTA (NCT01194414) were independent RCTs evaluating the efficacy and safety of TCZ-intravenous and\/or TCZ-subcutaneous with csDMARDs in patients with RA. PROs included patient global assessment, pain, Health Assessment Questionnaire-Disability Index, Functional Assessment of Chronic Illness Therapy-Fatigue and Short Form-36. Study outcomes included the proportions of patients reporting changes from baseline in PRO scores >= minimum clinically important differences (MCID) and scores >= age and gender-matched normative values. RESULTS: In OPTION, more patients who received TCZ-intravenous reported improvements in PROs >=MCID (50%-82% vs 31%-57%) and scores >= normative values (16%-44% vs 5%-28%) at week 16 compared with placebo. Similarly, a greater proportion of patients in BREVACTA who received TCZ-subcutaneous reported improvements >= MCID (54%-73% vs 42%-55%) and scores >= normative values (8%-34% vs 4%-25%) at week 12 compared with placebo. In SUMMACTA, 61%-84% of patients who received TCZ-subcutaneous and 64%-84% of those who received TCZ-intravenous reported improvements >= MCID and 14%-41% and 15%-24%, respectively, scores >= normative values at week 24. CONCLUSIONS: TCZ-intravenous or TCZ-subcutaneous with csDMARDs resulted in more patients reporting clinically meaningful improvements and PRO scores >= normative values compared with placebo. These improvements were similar with TCZ-intravenous and TCZ-subcutaneous.",

        "Published": "2013 Oct",
        "Abstract": "We determined the characteristic features of synovial tissues of rheumatoid arthritis (RA) patients treated by TNF inhibitors in order to delineate their mechanism of action. Synovial tissues were obtained during the joint surgical operations from 12 RA patients who had been treated with TNF inhibitors in addition to disease modifying antirheumatic drugs (DMARDs) for at least 5 months (5-25 months) (RA-TNFinh), and from 12 RA patients who had been treated with DMARDs alone (RA-DMARD), and were evaluated under light microscopy. There were no significant differences in disease duration, serum CRP levels, DAS28, Steinbrocker's stages on X-ray and treatment regimen except for TNF inhibitors between RA-TNFinh and RA-DMARD. The most prominent changes in the synovium from RA-TNFinh were discoid fibrosis in the subliming layers of the synovium with degeneration and detachment of synoviocytes and marked decrease in vasculatures. There was no significant difference in these synovial features between RA patients with infliximab and those with etanercept. Interestingly, appearance of osteoclasts was observed in RA-TNFinh (3 out of 12 patients) and in RA-DMARD (1 out of 12 patients). These results indicate that not only infliximab, but etanercept might have direct actions on synovial cells in the deep lining layers of the synovium, leading to the discoid fibrosis thereof. Moreover, the data confirm that the deep lining or sublining layers of the synovium are the most important portions that steer the disease process of RA synovitis.",

        "Published": "2008 Apr",
        "Abstract": "OBJECTIVES: To study treatment response rates of RA patients undergoing second- and third-line anti-TNF therapy and to identify baseline predictors of response to second-line treatment. METHODS: RA patients monitored in a prospective, observational study, having switched anti-TNF therapy once (first-time switchers, n = 337) or twice (second-time switchers, n = 36)--i.e. following failures with one antibody- and one receptor-type agent--between March 1999 and December 2006, were studied. Treatment responses at 3 months were assessed by the ACR and European League Against Rheumatism (EULAR) response criteria. Predictive potentials for response to second-line treatment of demographics, baseline disease activity measures, disease and treatment characteristics were analysed using logistic regression. RESULTS: ACR20 response was met by 51% of first-time and 35% of second-time switchers. Corresponding ACR50 rates were 27 and 18%; EULAR overall rates (EULAR good or moderate response) 71 and 58%; EULAR good rates 25 and 9% and 28-joint disease activity score (DAS28) remission rates 16 and 6%. Identified baseline predictors of response to second-line treatment were lower age and HAQ scores, elevated DAS28 values and having ceased the former anti-TNF treatment due to adverse events rather than inefficacy. No variable was predictive for all examined response criteria. CONCLUSIONS: Response rates of first-time anti-TNF switchers are somewhat below those of anti-TNF naive RA patients, while the markedly inferior response rates of second-time switchers suggest other therapeutic options to be considered in this situation. Identified baseline predictors of response may be useful indicators to second-line anti-TNF therapy, but vary depending on the response criteria set studied.",

        "Published": "2016 Jul",
        "Abstract": "The aim of this study is to assess the efficacy of withdrawing biologics from patients with rheumatoid arthritis in sustained remission or low disease activity. This is a systematic review of clinical trials that randomized withdrawal or continuation of biologics. We searched MEDLINE, Embase, and other databases. Three authors independently selected and extracted the data from the studies. The GRADE approach was employed to assess the quality of the evidence. We calculated meta-analyses of random effects model and estimated the heterogeneity by I (2). The number needed to treat (NNT) was calculated for significant outcomes. We included six trials (N = 1927 patients), most were industry-sponsored. Compared to withdrawing, continuing biologics increased the probability of low disease activity (relative risk [RR] = 0.66, 95 % CI 0.51-0.84, I (2) = 91 %, NNT = 4, low quality), remission (0.57, 0.44-0.74, I (2) = 82 %, NNT = 3, low quality), and radiographic progression (RR = 0.91, 95 % CI 0.85-0.98, I (2) = 13 %, NNT = 12, moderate quality). No significant difference was detected in the incidence of serious adverse events, serious infection, malignancy, and scores of improvement of tender and swollen joints between these strategies (low quality). A worse profile of outcomes was experienced by those patients when compared to the ones that continued biologics, but almost half of patients maintained low disease activity after withdrawal. As the quality of evidence was low, the conclusions may change as new results become available. The potential harms and benefits of this decision must be discussed with patients.",

SEARCH STRATEGY: We searched the Cochrane Musculoskeletal Group's trials register, the Cochrane Controlled Trials Register, Medline and Embase up to and including July 1997. We also carried out a handsearch of the reference lists of the trials retrieved from the electronic search. SELECTION CRITERIA: All randomized controlled trials (RCTs) and controlled clinical trials (CCTs) comparing antimalarials against placebo in patients with RA DATA COLLECTION AND ANALYSIS: Data abstraction was carried out independently by two reviewers. The same two reviewers using Jadad's scale (Jadad 1995) assessed the methodological quality of the RCTs and CCTs. Rheumatoid arthritis outcome measures were extracted from the publications for the 6-month endpoint. The pooled analysis was performed using standardized mean differences for joint counts, pain and global assessments. Weighted mean differences were used for erythrocyte sedimentation rate (ESR). Toxicity was evaluated with pooled odds ratios for withdrawals. A chi-square test was used to assess heterogeneity among trials. Fixed effects models were used throughout. MAIN RESULTS: We found four trials, with 300 patients randomized to hydrochloroquine and 292 to placebo. Only trials evaluating hydroxychloroquine could be pooled in the analysis. A statistically significant benefit was observed when hydroxychloroquine was compared to placebo. The standardized mean differences for the various outcome measures ranged from -0.33 to -0. 52, and were statistically significant. Statistically significant differences were also observed for ESR. Overall withdrawals and withdrawals due to lack of efficacy were significantly more frequent in the placebo group. No differences were observed in withdrawals due to toxicity. REVIEWER'S CONCLUSIONS: Hydroxychloroquine appears to be efficacious for the treatment of RA. Its overall effect appears to be moderate, but its low toxicity profile should be considered when treating patients with RA. [References: 4]",

        "Published": "2016 12 03",
        "Abstract": "BACKGROUND: To prevent debilitating and irreversible joint damage, rheumatoid arthritis (RA) is often treated with tumor necrosis factor inhibitor (TNFi), but many patients do not respond to this costly therapy. Few predictors for response are known, and it has been proposed that genetic factors which influence the development of RA may also influence disease severity and response to therapy. Several previous studies have attempted to confirm this but results remain inconclusive. We expand on previous studies by including more RA risk alleles, and maximize power by combining them into a genetic risk score. METHOD: We linked genotyped RA patients from the Epidemiological Investigation of Rheumatoid Arthritis study to the Swedish Rheumatology Quality Register, identifying patients who started a TNFi as their first biological disease-modifying anti-rheumatic drug, with a return visit within 2-8 months after treatment start (N = 867). We calculated risk scores from 76 established RA risk SNPs, and four HLA-DRB1 amino acid positions, and tested whether risk scores or individual genetic risk factors could predict the European League Against Rheumatism (EULAR) response. RESULTS: We found no association between any of the risk scores or HLA-DRB1 haplotypes and EULAR response, neither overall nor stratified by anti-citrullinated protein\/peptide antibody (ACPA) status. When evaluating each of the 76 SNPs, we found that the number of SNPs presenting significant associations was not higher than expected by chance (5\/76 SNPs had p < 0.05 in ACPA-positive RA, 4\/76 in ACPA-negative RA). CONCLUSION: Overall, known RA risk SNPs do not predict response to TNFi, either individually or when combined into a risk score. This does not support the hypothesis that genes influencing RA onset would also influence its prognosis and treatment response.",

        "Published": "2017 Nov",
        "Abstract": "PURPOSE: To investigate choroidal thickness in patients using hydroxychloroquine (HCQ) and compare choroidal thickness between eyes with and without HCQ retinopathy. DESIGN: Retrospective case series. METHODS: Setting: Institutional. PATIENTS: We included 124 patients with systemic lupus erythematosus or rheumatoid arthritis who were treated with HCQ. The patients were divided into an HCQ retinopathy group and a control group, according to the presence or absence of HCQ retinopathy. OBSERVATION: Total choroidal thickness and choriocapillaris-equivalent thickness were measured manually by 2 independent investigators using swept-source optical coherence tomography (SS-OCT; DRI-OCT, Topcon Inc, Tokyo, Japan). These measurements were made at the fovea and at nasal and temporal locations 0.5, 1.5, and 3 mm from the fovea. Medium-to-large vessel layer thickness was calculated accordingly. The thicknesses were compared between the HCQ retinopathy and control groups. We performed correlation analyses between choroidal thicknesses and details regarding HCQ use. MAIN OUTCOME MEASURES: Total choroidal thickness and choriocapillaris-equivalent thickness. RESULTS: Choroidal thicknesses were significantly decreased (P < .05) in the HCQ retinopathy group compared to the control group, except at the temporal choroid 1.5 mm from the fovea. Choriocapillaris-equivalent thicknesses were significantly different in all choroidal locations between the groups. In contrast, the medium-to-large vessel layer thickness was only significantly different at a few locations. The cumulative dose\/body weight was significantly correlated with subfoveal choroidal and choriocapillaris-equivalent thicknesses (both P = .001). The association between presence of HCQ retinopathy and choroidal thicknesses was also statistically significant after adjusting for age, diagnosis for HCQ use, refractive errors, and duration of HCQ use (P = .001 and P = .003 for subfoveal choroidal and choriocapillaris-equivalent thickness, respectively). CONCLUSIONS: These results all suggest that HCQ retinopathy is associated with choroidal thinning, especially in the choriocapillaris. Our results may suggest choroidal involvement of HCQ toxicity.

        "Abstract": "Rheumatoid arthritis (RA) is a multisystem inflammatory disease characterized by destructive synovitis and systemic extraarticular involvement. One of the most common pulmonary manifestations of RA is rheumatoid nodule. Spontaneous pneumothorax also very rare pulmonary finding and could be associated with pulmonary nodules. Antirheumatic drugs, methotrexate, leflunomide (LEF), infliximab and etanercept, were known as risk factors for developing rheumatoid nodule. However, there was no case report of rheumatoid nodule-associated pneumothorax with the use of LEF. We report, first, herein a case of 46-year-old woman with RA who suffered recurrent spontaneous pneumothorax associated with multiple bilateral subpleural cavitary nodules during treatment with LEF. We reviewed the cases of LEF-related pulmonary nodules developed in patients with RA. Thus, we suggested that pneumothorax can be a rare respiratory fatal complication in patients with RA with pulmonary nodules and LEF can be a rare cause of these manifestations.",

        "Published": "2014 Jul 28",
        "Abstract": "BACKGROUND: KIR genes coding for natural killer cell immunoglobulin-like receptors, KIR, influence the effector and regulatory function of NK cells as well as some subpopulations of T lymphocytes (e.g. CD4+CD28-KIR+) depending on presence of ligands (particularly HLA-C molecules). KIR-KIR ligand interaction may lead to the development of autoimmune disorders, including rheumatoid arthritis (RA). However, their role in the response of RA patients to methotrexate therapy is not known. METHODS: KIR genes and KIR-ligand (HLA-C C1\/C2 allomorphs) genotyping was performed using the PCR-SSP method in 312 RA patients (179 classified as good responders and 133 as poor responders using DAS28 criteria). Thus, we evaluated the association of KIR genes and HLA-C allomorphs with the response to methotrexate (MTX) treatment. RESULTS: We observed that patients possessing the full-length KIR2DS4 (KIR2DS4f) gene had a lower chance of responding in comparison to KIR2DS4f-negative cases. This phenomenon was observed both in erosive disease (ED) and rheumatoid factor (RF) positive and in ED- and RF-negative patients. Interestingly, the observed effect of the KIR2DS4f gene was strongest in individuals possessing medium values (20-33 mm\/h) of the erythrocyte sedimentation rate (ESR). Patients with high ESR values had low probability and, in contrast, patients with low ESR had a high probability of MTX response, and the presence of KIR2DS4f did not affect their outcome. Additionally, we show that the KIR2DS4f effect did not depend on the presence of either C1 or C2 allomorphs. CONCLUSION: Our results suggest that the response of RA patients with medium ESR values to MTX treatment may be dependent on the full-length KIR2DS4 gene.",

        "Abstract": "OBJECTIVE: To examine the effect of anti-tumor necrosis factor-alpha (anti-TNF) therapy in patients with reactive AA amyloidosis associated with rheumatoid arthritis (RA). METHODS: Fourteen patients with reactive AA amyloidosis associated with RA were prospectively evaluated. Four patients were treated with infliximab and 10 with etanercept. The mean period of anti-TNF therapy was 20.1 +\/- 13.8 months. Laboratory findings and renal function were examined before and after initiation of anti-TNF therapy. In 9 patients the area of amyloid deposits in serial gastroduodenal mucosal biopsy specimens was examined and image analysis was performed. RESULTS: C-reactive protein and serum amyloid A protein levels were significantly reduced after initiation of anti-TNF therapy. Twenty-four hour creatinine clearance improved in 4 patients, did not change in 5, and deteriorated in 3. Twenty-four hour urinary protein excretion was significantly decreased in 3 patients, not exacerbated in 6, and increased in 3 after initiation of anti-TNF therapy. The biopsy specimens from the 9 patients who underwent serial gastroduodenal biopsies showed significant decreases in the area of amyloid deposits, from 8.8% +\/- 6.4% to 1.6% +\/- 0.6% (p = 0.003) after initiation of anti-TNF therapy. Four patients showed a sustained decrease in the areas of amyloid deposits in their third biopsy specimens, and amyloid deposits were not detectable in 2. CONCLUSION: Our results indicate a striking effect of anti-TNF therapy for rapid removal and sustained disappearance of amyloid deposits in gastric mucosal tissue with amelioration of renal functions in patients with reactive amyloidosis due to RA.",

        "Published": "2018 Dec",
        "Abstract": "INTRODUCTION: Methotrexate is a cytotoxic agent used in leukemia, and several other cancer types and at lower doses in auto-inflammatory diseases such as rheumatoid arthritis, ankylosing spondylitis and psoriasis. Macrolide antibiotics are effective against gram-positive and Gram-negative bacteria. They have anti-inflammatory activities as well. Clarithromycin is a macrolide with anti-inflammatory activity through blockage of the p38 MAPK signal cascade, which is involved in methotrexate-induced pulmonary toxicity. AIM: In this study, the efficacy of clarithromycin in protecting against pulmonary fibrosis was investigated in the rat model for methotrexate-induced pulmonary fibrosis. MATERIAL AND METHODS: A total of 30 female rats were divided into three groups. Group I was administered intraperitoneal and intragastric saline; group II was administered oral 3 mg\/kg methotrexate; and group III was administered oral 3 mg\/kg methotrexate + intraperitoneal 200 mg\/kg clarithromycin for 28 days. Histopathological analyses of the lung tissues were performed under light microscopy. RESULTS: Normal histopathological changes were observed in the control group. Pulmonary fibrosis was significantly higher in the methotrexate group than in the other groups (p < 0.005). CONCLUSIONS: Clarithromycin was shown to be effective in protecting against methotrexate-induced pulmonary fibrosis; further studies should be performed to determine the dosage and safety.",

        "Published": "2014 Mar",
        "Abstract": "OBJECTIVES: To evaluate the efficacy and safety of adalimumab+methotrexate (MTX) in Japanese patients with early rheumatoid arthritis (RA) who had not previously received MTX or biologics. METHODS: This randomised, double-blind, placebo-controlled, multicentre study evaluated adalimumab 40 mg every other week+MTX 6-8 mg every week versus MTX 6-8 mg every week alone for 26 weeks in patients with RA (<=2-year duration). The primary endpoint was inhibition of radiographic progression (change (DELTA) from baseline in modified total Sharp score (mTSS)) at week 26. RESULTS: A total of 171 patients received adalimumab+MTX (mean dose, 6.2+\/-0.8 mg\/week) and 163 patients received MTX alone (mean dose, 6.6+\/-0.6 mg\/week, p<0.001). The mean RA duration was 0.3 years and 315 (94.3%) had high disease activity (DAS28>5.1). Adalimumab+MTX significantly inhibited radiographic progression at week 26 versus MTX alone (DELTAmTSS, 1.5+\/-6.1 vs 2.4+\/-3.2, respectively; p<0.001). Significantly more patients in the adalimumab+MTX group (62.0%) did not show radiographic progression (DELTAmTSS<=0.5) versus the MTX alone group (35.4%; p<0.001). Patients treated with adalimumab+MTX were significantly more likely to achieve American College of Rheumatology responses and achieve clinical remission, using various definitions, at 26 weeks versus MTX alone. Combination therapy was well tolerated, and no new safety signals were observed. CONCLUSIONS: Adalimumab in combination with low-dose MTX was well tolerated and efficacious in suppressing radiographic progression and improving clinical outcomes in Japanese patients with early RA and high disease activity.",

        "Published": "2017 Mar",
        "Abstract": "BACKGROUND: Methotrexate (MTX) is widely used and considered a first-line disease modifying antirheumatic drug (DMARD) for the treatment of rheumatoid arthritis (RA). However, 10% to 30% of patients discontinue therapy within a year of starting the treatment, usually because of undesirable side effects. Many of the relevant genes have been investigated to estimate the association between gene polymorphisms and MTX toxicity in RA patients, although inconsistent results have been reported. METHODS: We searched EMBASE and PubMed in February 2016 for polymorphisms and pharmacogenomics study of the toxicity of MTX monotherapy in RA patients. The meta-analysis was stratified by whether genetic variants associated with MTX toxicity. RESULTS: A total of 42 publications that included 28 genes with 88 gene SNPs associated with the transporters, enzymes, and metabolites of MTX or the progression of RA were included in the SR, and 31 studies were included in 7 meta-analyses. The meta-analysis showed a significant association between the toxicity of MTX and the RFC-1 80G > A (rs1051266) polymorphism in the European RA patients. CONCLUSION: RFC-1 80G > A (rs1051266) polymorphism was associated with MTX toxicity, and larger and more stringent study designs may provide more accurate results for the effect of these SNPs on the MTX toxicity.",

        "Published": "2016 04",
        "Abstract": "INTRODUCTION: Biologic therapies are used to treat several inflammatory diseases, including rheumatoid arthritis (RA), psoriasis (PsO), psoriatic arthritis (PsA), and ankylosing spondylitis (AS). Data from a commercial claims database were used to evaluate utilization and cost of biologic treatment for these conditions. METHODS: Data were obtained from the Optum Research Database. Patients were aged 18-63 years with diagnosis of moderate to severe RA, PsO, PsA, and\/or AS and first (index) claim for biologics abatacept, adalimumab, certolizumab pegol, etanercept, golimumab, infliximab, rituximab, tocilizumab, or ustekinumab or non-biologic tofacitinib between March 1, 2011 and February 28, 2013. One-year treatment costs were based on observed paid amounts and used to impute dosing. Treatment patterns (persistence, switching, discontinuing, restarting) were evaluated. RESULTS: Data from 20,159 patients were analyzed for index medications abatacept (n = 583), adalimumab (n = 6521), certolizumab pegol (n = 415), etanercept (n = 9116), golimumab (n = 231), infliximab (n = 1906), rituximab (n = 295), tocilizumab (n = 165), ustekinumab (n = 922), and tofacitinib (n = 5). For patients with RA only, costs were lowest for tofacitinib ($18,769), rituximab ($19,569), or abatacept ($21,877), and ranged from $23,682 to $30,269 for all other medications. For patients with PsO only, costs were lowest for adalimumab ($29,186), etanercept ($31,212), and infliximab ($32,409) compared with ustekinumab ($53,746). For patients with PsA only, costs were lowest for etanercept ($26,916), followed by golimumab ($27,987), adalimumab ($28,749), and infliximab ($31,974). Costs were lowest with etanercept for RA plus PsA ($25,477) and for PsO plus PsA ($29,376), and with golimumab for AS only ($24,225). Across indications, annual costs were $29,521, $27,488, and $28,672 for adalimumab, etanercept, and infliximab, respectively; persistence was greatest with infliximab (range 66-79%) compared with 11-59% for all other biologics. CONCLUSION: One-year treatment costs varied considerably between medications and indications. Some newly approved agents had lower costs but further research is needed to confirm these estimates as more patients are treated.

        "Abstract": "The aim of this work was to study the effect of anti-TNF treatment on CD4+ Th1, Th17 and regulatory T cells (Tregs), together with CD8+ T cells and NK cells from rheumatoid arthritis (RA) patients. For this purpose, 18 RA patients received adalimumab during 16weeks and their peripheral blood lymphocytes were assessed by flow cytometry at the beginning and at the end of the study. We found that the proportion of Th17 cells was directly correlated with Th1 cells, but inversely correlated with IFN-gamma-producing NK cells. A decrease was observed in Th1, Th17 cells and IFN-gamma-producing CD8+ T cells by anti-TNF therapy. Conversely, the proportion of Tregs increased, as did the percentage of IFN-gamma-producing NK cells. We postulate that a rise in IFN-gamma production due to recovery of NK cells' function, together with expanded Tregs, contribute to decrease the Th17 response in anti-TNF-treated RA patients.

        "Abstract": "BACKGROUND: The aim of the Dose Reduction or Discontinuation of Etanercept in Methotrexate-Treated Rheumatoid Arthritis Patients Who Have Achieved a Stable Low Disease Activity-State study was to investigate the effect of etanercept (ETN) dose maintenance, reduction or withdrawal on patients with rheumatoid arthritis (RA) who had already achieved stable low disease activity (LDA) on ETN 50 mg+methotrexate (MTX). METHODS: Patients with RA (n=91) and stable LDA with ETN 50 mg once weekly (QW)+MTX were included. After 8 weeks with unchanged treatment, 73 patients were randomised in a double-blind design to ETN 50 mg QW+MTX (ETN50), ETN 25 mg QW+MTX (ETN25) or placebo QW+MTX (PBO) for 48 weeks. Patients who flared were declared failures and treated with open-label ETN50 until week 48. The primary outcome was the proportion of patients on ETN50 versus PBO who were non-failures after 48 weeks. RESULTS: The proportion of non-failure patients was significantly lower with ETN50 (52%; p=0.007) and ETN25 (44%; p=0.044) versus PBO (13%). Median time to failure was significantly shorter with PBO (6 weeks) compared with ETN50 (48 weeks; p=0.001) and ETN25 (36 weeks; p<0.001). The majority of patients who flared regained LDA with open-label ETN50 quickly. Adverse events were consistent with the known side effect profiles of these medications. CONCLUSIONS: In patients with established RA who have achieved stable LDA on ETN50+MTX, continuing both is superior to PBO+MTX. Reduced dose ETN was also more effective than PBO in maintaining a favourable response, suggesting that a maintenance strategy with reduced dose ETN may be possible in a number of patients with established RA.

        "Published": "2016 Feb 03",
        "Abstract": "BACKGROUND: In this study, we assessed whether clinical and ultrasonography (US)-based remission could be used to select patients with rheumatoid arthritis (RA) eligible to taper and discontinue anti-TNF-alpha therapy after achievement of remission, looking at disease relapse. METHODS: Forty-two patients with RA in sustained remission who were receiving anti-TNF-alpha treatment (Disease Activity Score <1.6 at three visits 3 months apart) underwent US evaluation of synovial hypertrophy (SH) and power Doppler (PD) signal presence. Five SH+\/PD- patients with RA underwent US-guided knee synovial tissue biopsy to assess histological features of residual synovitis (CD68, CD3 and CD20 immunostaining) after sustained clinical remission was achieved. All patients were enrolled to taper first then discontinue anti-TNF-alpha. They were followed every 3 months afterwards, and the relapse rate was recorded. RESULTS: Selected SH+\/PD- patients showed low-grade synovitis as demonstrated by the presence of CD68+ cells in the lining layer and few infiltrating CD3+ and CD20+ cells at the time sustained clinical remission was achieved. After anti-TNF-alpha tapering, 13 patients (30.9 %) relapsed and 29 (69.1 %) SH+\/PD- patients maintained disease remission after 3 months and discontinued anti-TNF-alpha treatment. Among them, 26 patients (89.7 %) maintained disease remission status after 6 months of follow-up. All patients who relapsed were retreated with the previous biologic, following the last effective therapeutic regimen, again reaching a good European League Against Rheumatism response within 3 months. CONCLUSIONS: US evaluation using PD signalling allows the identification of patients with RA in clinical and histological remission after tapering and discontinuing biologics.",

        "Abstract": "This study was conducted to investigate disease-modifying antirheumatic drug (DMARD) utilization in Korean elderly patients with rheumatoid arthritis (RA). We used data from January 1, 2005 to June 30, 2006 from the Health Insurance Review and Assessment Service claims database. The study subjects were defined as patients aged 65 yr or older with at least two claims with a diagnosis of RA. DMARD use was compared by the patients' age-group, gender, medical service, and geographic divisions. The patterns of DMARD use in mono- and combination therapy were calculated. RA medication use was calculated by the number of defined daily doses (DDD)\/1,000 patients\/day. A total of 166,388 patients were identified during the study period. DMARD use in RA patients was 12.0%. The proportion of DMARD use was higher in the younger elderly, females, and patients treated in big cities. Hydroxychloroquine was the most commonly used DMARD in monotherapy, and most of the combination therapies prescribed it with methotrexate. DMARD use in elderly RA patients was noticeably low, although drug prescriptions showed an increasing trend during the study period, clinicians may need to pay more attention to elderly RA patients.",

        "Published": "2017 Jul",
        "Abstract": "The biological DMARD (bDMARD) abatacept (Orencia R), a recombinant fusion protein, selectively modulates a co-stimulatory signal necessary for T-cell activation. In the EU, abatacept is approved for use in patients with highly active and progressive rheumatoid arthritis (RA) not previously treated with methotrexate. Abatacept is also approved for the treatment of moderate to severe active RA in patients with an inadequate response to previous therapy with at least one conventional DMARD (cDMARD), including methotrexate or a TNF inhibitor. In phase III trials, beneficial effects on RA signs and symptoms, disease activity, structural damage progression and physical function were seen with intravenous (IV) or subcutaneous (SC) abatacept regimens, including abatacept plus methotrexate in methotrexate-naive patients with early RA and poor prognostic factors, and abatacept plus methotrexate or other cDMARDs in patients with inadequate response to methotrexate or TNF inhibitors. Benefits were generally maintained during longer-term follow-up. Absolute drug-free remission rates following withdrawal of all RA treatments were significantly higher with abatacept plus methotrexate than with methotrexate alone. Both IV and SC abatacept were generally well tolerated, with low rates of immunogenicity. Current evidence therefore suggests that abatacept is a useful treatment option for patients with RA.",

        "Abstract": "AIM: To examine the efficacy of abatacept in patients with rheumatoid arthritis (RA) using magnetic resonance imaging (MRI) of bilateral hands. METHOD: This prospective study included 35 RA patients. MRI of bilateral hands was performed at baseline and after 12 months of treatment with intravenous abatacept. MRI images were scored for synovitis, osteitis, erosion and joint space narrowing (JSN) according to the RA MRI Scoring System (RAMRIS). The primary endpoint was the change in RAMRIS score from baseline. Repair of erosion was defined as a negative change in the erosion score that was greater than the smallest detectable changes (SDCs). RESULTS: Thirty-one patients completed the study. Median synovitis and osteitis scores showed statistically significant reductions at Month 12 when compared to baseline (synovitis score, -5.5 [P < 0.0001]; osteitis score, -0.5 [P = 0.03]). However, median erosion and JSN scores did not significantly change. At Month 12, 83% of patients showed no progression of erosion scores and repair of erosion was observed in 11% of patients. All patients with repair of erosion achieved functional remission (Health Assessment Questionnaire-Disability Index <= 0.5). The Simplified Disease Activity Index response rate at Month 1 was identified as an independent factor predicting changes in the erosion scores at Month 12. CONCLUSION: Abatacept treatment reduced synovitis and osteitis scores and did not worsen erosion and JSN scores at Month 12. Over 10% of patients experienced repair of erosion.

        "Published": "2014 Dec",
        "Abstract": "OBJECTIVE: This phase III, 52-week study compared fostamatinib with placebo (for 24 weeks) in patients with active rheumatoid arthritis (RA) and an inadequate response to methotrexate (MTX) therapy. METHODS: Patients taking MTX were randomized (1:1:1) to receive fostamatinib 100 mg twice daily for 52 weeks (group A), fostamatinib 100 mg twice daily for 4 weeks and then 150 mg once daily (group B), or placebo for 24 weeks and then fostamatinib 100 mg twice daily (group C). At week 24, the co-primary end points were change from baseline in the American College of Rheumatology 20% (ACR20) improvement response rates and change in the modified total Sharp\/van der Heijde score of radiographic damage (SHS). RESULTS: In this study, 918 patients were randomized and received >=1 dose of study drug (fostamatinib or placebo); the demographic and baseline clinical characteristics were well balanced. Following treatment with both fostamatinib regimens, a statistically significant difference in the ACR20 improvement response was achieved at week 24 as compared with that in patients receiving placebo (49.0% [group A] and 44.4%, [group B] versus 34.2%; P < 0.001 and P = 0.006, respectively), but there was no statistically significant difference in the SHS between either fostamatinib group and placebo (P = 0.25 and P = 0.17, respectively). The most common adverse events in patients in groups A, B, and C were hypertension (15.8%, 15.1%, and 3.9%, respectively) and diarrhea (13.9%, 15.1%, and 3.9%, respectively). Elevated blood pressure (>=140\/90 mm Hg) occurred at >=1 visit in 44.2%, 41.6%, and 19.3% of patients in each respective group. CONCLUSION: With the use of either fostamatinib regimen in patients with RA, statistically significant, but not clinically significant, improvements in the ACR20 improvement response over placebo were achieved at 24 weeks, whereas a significant difference in the SHS was not seen. The overall level of response to treatment with fostamatinib was lower than had been observed in the phase II program, but similar adverse events were reported.

        "Published": "2014 Jan 25",
        "Abstract": "BACKGROUND: Biological agents offer good control of rheumatoid arthritis, but the long-term benefits of achieving low disease activity with a biological agent plus methotrexate or methotrexate alone are unclear. The OPTIMA trial assessed different treatment adjustment strategies in patients with early rheumatoid arthritis attaining (or not) stable low disease activity with adalimumab plus methotrexate or methotrexate monotherapy. METHODS: This trial was done at 161 sites worldwide. Patients with early (<1 year duration) rheumatoid arthritis naive to methotrexate were randomly allocated (by interactive voice response system, in a 1:1 ratio, block size four) to adalimumab (40 mg every other week) plus methotrexate (initiated at 7.5 mg\/week, increased by 2.5 mg every 1-2 weeks to a maximum weekly dose of 20 mg by week 8) or placebo plus methotrexate for 26 weeks (period 1). Patients in the adalimumab plus methotrexate group who completed period 1 and achieved the stable low disease activity target (28-joint disease activity score with C-reactive protein [DAS28]<3.2 at weeks 22 and 26) were randomised to adalimumab-continuation or adalimumab-withdrawal for an additional 52 weeks (period 2). Patients achieving the target with initial methotrexate continued methotrexate-monotherapy. Inadequate responders were offered adalimumab plus methotrexate. All patients and investigators were masked to treatment allocation in period 1. During period 2, treatment reallocation of patients who achieved the target was masked to patients and investigators; patients who did not achieve the target remained masked to original randomisation, but were aware of the subsequent assignment. The primary endpoint was a composite measure of DAS28 of less than 3.2 at week 78 and radiographic non-progression from baseline to week 78, compared between adalimumab-continuation and methotrexate-monotherapy. Adverse events were monitored throughout period 2. This trial is registered with ClinicalTrials.gov, number NCT00420927. FINDINGS: The study was done between Dec 28, 2006, and Aug 3, 2010. 1636 patients were assessed and 1032 were randomised in period 1 (515 to adalimumab plus methotrexate; 517 to placebo plus methotrexate). 466 patients in the adalimumab plus methotrexate group completed period 1; 207 achieved the stable low disease activity target, of whom 105 were rerandomised to adalimumab-continuation. 460 patients in the placebo plus methotrexate group completed period 1; 112 achieved the stable low disease activity target and continued methotrexate-monotherapy. 73 of 105 (70%) patients in the adalimumab-continuation group and 61 of 112 (54%) patients in the methotrexate-monotherapy group achieved the primary endpoint at week 78 (mean difference 15% [95% CI 2-28%], p=0.0225). Patients achieving the stable low disease activity target on adalimumab plus methotrexate who withdrew adalimumab mostly maintained their good responses. Overall, 706 of 926 patients in period 2 had an adverse event, of which 82 were deemed serious; however, distribution of adverse events did not differ between groups. INTERPRETATION: Treatment to a stable low disease activity target resulted in improved clinical, functional, and structural outcomes, with both adalimumab-continuation and methotrexate-monotherapy. However, a higher proportion of patients treated with initial adalimumab plus methotrexate achieved the low disease activity target compared with those initially treated with methotrexate alone. Outcomes were much the same whether adalimumab was continued or withdrawn in patients who initially responded to adalimumab plus methotrexate. FUNDING: AbbVie. Copyright © 2014 Elsevier Ltd.

        "Published": "2015 Jun 16",
        "Abstract": "Rheumatoid arthritis (RA) is the most common joint-related autoimmune disease and one of the most severe. Despite intensive investigation, the RA inflammatory process remains largely unknown and finding effective and long lasting therapies that specifically target RA is a challenging task. This study proposes a different approach for RA therapy, taking advantage of the new emerging field of nanomedicine to develop a targeted theranostic system for intravenous administration, using solid lipid nanoparticles (SLN), a biocompatible and biodegradable colloidal delivery system, surface-functionalized with an anti-CD64 antibody that specifically targets macrophages in RA. Methotrexate (MTX) and superparamagnetic iron oxide nanoparticles (SPIONs) were co-encapsulated inside the SLNs to be used as therapeutic and imaging agents, respectively. All the formulations presented sizes under 250 nm and zeta potential values lower than -16 mV, suitable characteristics for intravenous administration. Transmission electron microscopy (TEM) photographs indicated that the SPIONs were encapsulated inside the SLN matrix and MTX association efficiency values were higher than 98%. In vitro studies, using THP-1 cells, demonstrated that all formulations presented low cytotoxicity at concentrations lower than 500 mug\/mL. It was proven that the proposed NPs were not cytotoxic, that both a therapeutic and imaging agent could be co-encapsulated and that the SLN could be functionalized for a potential future application such as anti-body specific targeting. The proposed formulations are, therefore, promising candidates for future theranostic applications.",

        "Published": "2010 Jan 20",
        "Abstract": "BACKGROUND: Golimumab is a humanized inhibitor of Tumor necrosis factor-alpha, recently approved by the Food and Drug Administration (FDA) for the treatment of Rheumatoid arthritis (RA). OBJECTIVES: The objective of this systematic review was to compare the efficacy and safety of golimumab (alone or in combination with DMARDs or biologics) to placebo (alone or in combination with DMARDs or biologics) in randomized or quasi-randomized clinical trials in adults with RA. SEARCH STRATEGY: An expert librarian searched six databases for any clinical trials of golimumab in RA, including the Cochrane Central Register of Controlled Trials (CENTRAL), OVID MEDLINE, CINAHL, EMBASE, Science Citation Index (Web of Science) and Current Controlled Trials databases. SELECTION CRITERIA: Studies were included if they used golimumab in adults with RA, were randomized or quasi-randomized and provided clinical outcomes. DATA COLLECTION AND ANALYSIS: Two review authors (JS, SN) independently reviewed all titles and abstracts, selected appropriate studies for full review and reviewed the full-text articles for the final selection of included studies. For each study, they independently abstracted study characteristics, safety and efficacy data and performed risk of bias assessment. Disagreements were resolved by consensus. For continuous measures, we calculated mean differences or standardized mean differences and for categorical measures, relative risks. 95% confidence intervals were calculated. MAIN RESULTS: Four RCTs with 1,231 patients treated with golimumab and 483 patients treated with placebo were included. Of these, 436 were treated with the FDA-approved dose of golimumab 50 mg every four weeks. Compared to patients treated with placebo+methotrexate, patients treated with the FDA-approved dose of golimumab+methotrexate were 2.6 times more likely to reach ACR50 (95% confidence interval (CI) 1.3 to 4.9; P=0.005 and NNT= 5, 95% confidence interval 2 to 20), no more likely to have any adverse event (relative risk 1.1, 95% Cl 0.9 to 1.2; P=0.44), and 0.5 times as likely to have overall withdrawals (95% Cl 0.3 to 0.8; P=0.005). Golimumab-treated patients were significantly more likely to achieve remission, low disease activity and improvement in functional ability compared to placebo (all statistically significant). No significant differences were noted between golimumab and placebo regarding serious adverse events, infections, serious infections, lung infections, tuberculosis, cancer, withdrawals due to adverse events and inefficacy and deaths. No radiographic data were reported. AUTHORS' CONCLUSIONS: With an overall high grade of evidence, at the FDA-approved dose, golimumab is significantly more efficacious than placebo in treatment of patients with active RA , when used in combination with methotrexate. The short-term safety profile, based on short-term RCTs, is reasonable with no differences in total adverse events, serious infections, cancer, tuberculosis or deaths. Long-term surveillance studies are needed for safety assessment. [References: 50]",

        "Abstract": "OBJECTIVE: To determine whether a functional single-nucleotide polymorphism in the B-cell activating factor (BAFF) gene correlates with the response to treatment with rituximab (RTX) in RA. METHODS: SMART is a randomized open trial (NCT01126541) assessing two strategies of re-treatment in patients responding to 1-g infusion of RTX with MTX on days 1 and 15 after failure, intolerance or contraindication to TNF blockers. Among the 224 patients included, 115 provided informed consent, could be genotyped and were included in an ancillary study of SMART assessing European League Against Rheumatism (EULAR) response rate after the first course of RTX according to BAFF-871C>T polymorphism. Baseline clinical factors (patients and disease characteristics) and biologic factors (ESR, CRP, RF, anti-citrullinated peptide antibodies, serum immunoglobulins) were collected. Univariate analyses were performed to assess whether BAFF-871C>T polymorphism was associated with EULAR response at week 24. Results with P < 0.15 obtained in univariate analyses were then included in multivariate analysis adjusted on DAS28 level. RESULTS: Ninety-three patients (81%) were responders, of whom 31 (27%) were good responders. CC genotype was significantly associated with a higher response rate [92% of responders vs 64% for TT genotype, odds ratio (OR) = 6.9; 95% CI 1.6, 29.6; P = 0.03]. These results were also confirmed in RF-positive patients (96% vs 58%, P = 0.006). In multivariate analysis, C allele carriage was independently associated with response to RTX (OR = 4.1; 95% CI 1.3, 12.7; P = 0.017). CONCLUSION: The BAFF-871C>T polymorphism seems to influence the response to RTX in RA patients after failure or intolerance to TNF blockers.",

        "Published": "1996 Jun",
        "Abstract": "Antimalarial drugs are effective disease modifying agents in RA with a low incidence of serious toxic effects. Recently, combinations of second-line agents have been used in RA in attempts to treat patients with no response to a number of single agents, or suboptimal response to a single agent. Combinations of drugs have been selected for maximum efficacy and minimum toxicity, but clinical trials are difficult to design and interpret. In particular, ensuring adequate power to detect small differences in response poses a major problem. Antimalarials are an attractive choice for combination therapy due to their efficacy, mechanisms of action and toxicity profile. In this review, the evidence for the use of antimalarials in combination in RA is examined. No advantage has been shown in combining antimalarials with gold, penicillamine or sulphasalazine compared with monotherapeutic regimens. There is some evidence to suggest a beneficial combination of antimalarials with methotrexate, but this is as yet inconclusive. Open non-randomised uncontrolled studies have shown that antimalarials combined with cytotoxic agents are effective but highly toxic. The authors conclude that there is little good evidence to support the introduction of combination second-line drug therapy for RA into widespread therapeutic use. [References: 53]",

        "Abstract": "The American College of Rheumatology (ACR) 20% preliminary definition of improvement in rheumatoid arthritis (RA) (ACR20) is widely used in clinical trials to assess response to treatment. The objectives of this analysis were to develop an exposure-response model of ACR20 in subjects receiving treatment with certolizumab pegol and to predict clinical outcomes following various treatment schedules. At each visit, subjects were classified as being ACR20 responders or ACR20 nonresponders or as having dropped out. A Markov mixed-effects model was developed to investigate the effects of the drug on the transitions between the three defined states. Increasing certolizumab pegol exposure predicted an increasing probability of becoming a responder and remaining a responder, as well as a reduced probability of dropping out of treatment.

Blocking TNF with monoclonal antibodies has also been beneficial in Crohn's disease. We attempted to determine the efficacy and safety of etanercept for induction of clinical, endoscopic, and histological improvement in patients with moderate to severe Crohn's disease despite standard treatment. METHODS: Ten patients with active Crohn's disease were treated with etanercept (25 mg s.c.) twice per week for 12 wk. Background therapy was kept stable during the trial. Crohn's disease activity index (CDAI), Inflammatory Bowel Disease Questionnaire, and C-reactive protein levels were measured at weeks 0, 2, 4, 8, and 12. Colonoscopies were performed before and after therapy in responders; endoscopic biopsies were scored for inflammation. RESULTS: At week 2 after the start, a clinical response (deltaCDAI > or = 70) was observed in 6\/10 patients (median = 305 [294-418] to 166 [107-392]), with reduction in serum C-reactive protein levels (median = 17.2 [6.8-67.2] to 9.1 [0.9-17.2] mg\/dl). Colonoscopies showed a reduction in inflammatory lesions in the four patients who attained remission (CDAI < 150), whereas the inflammatory score of the biopsies did not decrease significantly. No moderate or severe adverse events were observed. CONCLUSIONS: Etanercept may be effective in Crohn's disease refractory to standard therapy.",

Overall the ideal protocol was followed in 65% of cases: this ranged from 93% for methotrexate to 26% for sodium aurothiromalate. Most of the monitoring was done in general practice (e.g. 67% of all blood tests) and, with some exceptions, general practitioners (GPs) were willing to perform this task. However, many GPs reported logistic differences with specimen transfer and expressed the need for more information and support. Poor communication between hospital, patient and GP was also found to be a cause of protocol failure.",

        "Published": "2016 08",
        "Abstract": "OBJECTIVE: Tumor necrosis factor inhibitor (TNFi) biologic agents are an effective treatment for rheumatoid arthritis (RA). It is unclear whether patients whose disease is in remission or who have stable low disease activity need to continue use of TNFi or can stop this treatment. This study was undertaken to assess whether patients with established RA who are in remission or have stable low disease activity can effectively and safely stop their TNFi therapy. METHODS: The study was designed as a pragmatic multicenter, open-label randomized controlled trial. Inclusion criteria were a diagnosis of RA according to the American College of Rheumatology 1987 classification criteria, as well as use of a TNFi for at least 1 year along with a stable dose of disease-modifying antirheumatic drugs and a Disease Activity Score in 28 joints (DAS28) of <3.2 over the 6 months preceding trial inclusion. Patients were randomized in a 2:1 ratio to either stop or continue treatment with their current TNFi. Flare was defined as a DAS28 of >=3.2 during the 12-month follow-up period and an increase in score of >=0.6 compared to the baseline DAS28. RESULTS: In total, 531 patients were allocated to the stop group and 286 to the TNFi continuation group. At 12 months, more patients had experienced a flare in the stop group (272 [51.2%] of 531) than in the continuation group (52 [18.2%] of 286; P < 0.001). The hazard ratio for occurrence of a flare after stopping TNFi was 3.50 (95% confidence interval [95% CI] 2.60-4.72). The mean DAS28 in the stop group was significantly higher during the follow-up period compared to that in the continuation group (P < 0.001). Of the 195 patients who restarted TNFi treatment after experiencing a flare and within 26 weeks after stopping, 165 (84.6%) had regained a DAS28 of <3.2 by 6 months later, and the median time to a regained DAS28 of <3.2 was 12 weeks (95% Cl 10.7-13.3). There were more hospitalizations in the stop group than in the continuation group (6.4% versus 2.4%). CONCLUSION: Stopping TNFi treatment results in substantially more flares than does continuation of TNFi in patients with established RA in remission or with stable low disease activity.

        "Published": "2005 Feb",
        "Abstract": "OBJECTIVE: Cardiovascular morbidity and mortality appear to be enhanced in rheumatoid arthritis (RA), which might be due to an increased prevalence of cardiovascular risk factors such as dyslipidemia. It was recently shown that effective disease modifying antirheumatic drug treatment had a favorable influence on the lipid profile in patients with active RA. As infliximab markedly reduces disease activity in RA, we investigated the effects of infliximab on the lipid profile. METHODS: Infliximab was administered at baseline and at 2 and 6 weeks in patients with active RA. Total cholesterol and HDL-cholesterol concentrations were measured and their ratio, the atherogenic index (an important cardiovascular risk factor indicator), was assessed. RESULTS: Sixty-nine patients were enrolled. The Disease Activity Index score (DAS-28) was 5.9 (SD +\/- 1.4) at baseline and decreased to 4.6 (+\/- 1.4) after 2 weeks and further to 4.1 (+\/- 1.5) after 6 weeks. Total cholesterol level was 5.2 mmol\/l at baseline and increased to 5.7 mmol\/l (p < 0.001) at 2 weeks, and was 5.6 mmol\/l (p < 0.001 vs baseline) at Week 6. For HDL-cholesterol these values were 1.5, 1.6 (p < 0.001), and 1.6 mmol\/l (p < 0.001 vs baseline), respectively. Changes in disease activity were significantly inversely associated with changes in total cholesterol and HDL-cholesterol levels. The atherogenic index, however, remained constant. Corticosteroid use at baseline was associated with significantly higher total cholesterol and HDL-cholesterol levels and a lower (more favorable) atherogenic index at baseline. CONCLUSION: Infliximab treatment was associated with a significant increase of both total cholesterol and HDL-cholesterol levels, which correlated with decreasing disease activity. However, this was not accompanied by a favorable effect on the atherogenic index. The favorable effect of infliximab on cardiovascular comorbidity might not be mediated by effects on lipid metabolism, but longterm investigations are needed to confirm this.",

        "Published": "2008 May",
        "Abstract": "PURPOSE OF REVIEW: This study reviews therapeutic approaches of direct and indirect B-cell targeting in autoimmune diseases and their impact on protective immunity. RECENT FINDINGS: Beyond recent clinical experiences with rituximab as B-cell-depleting agent, other biologicals targeting CD20, such as ocrelizumab, ofatumumab, hA20, and TRU-015 mainly deplete B cells and are under clinical investigation in different entities. Moreover, anti-CD22 targeting as another approach that has been studied in clinical trials showed a modest depletion, but inhibition of B-cell activation. More indirect innovative B-cell-affecting therapies comprise blockade of cytokines, such as B-cell-activating factor (BAFF\/BLyS), APRIL, and their receptors as well as blockade of costimulation. Although decreases of immunoglobulin levels were seen, so far no major increases in infections were reported. SUMMARY: The value of certain B-cell-depletion therapies as well as other therapies modulating B-cell functions needs to be further delineated, especially in the therapeutic regimen of rheumatoid arthritis, specific collagen vascular diseases and vasculitis. Long-term observations of protective immunity are also needed to further evaluate the rate of infections. [References: 55]",

        "Published": "2013 Mar 16",
        "Abstract": "BACKGROUND: Clinical remission and low disease activity are essential treatment targets in patients with rheumatoid arthritis. Although moderately active rheumatoid arthritis is common, treatment effects in moderate disease have not been well studied. Additionally, optimum use of biologics needs further investigation, including the use of induction, maintenance, and withdrawal treatment strategies. The aim of the PRESERVE trial was to assess whether low disease activity would be sustained with reduced doses or withdrawal of etanercept in patients with moderately active disease. METHODS: In a randomised controlled trial, patients aged between 18 and 70 years with moderately active rheumatoid arthritis (disease activity score in 28 joints [DAS28] >3.2 and <=5.1) despite treatment with methotrexate were enrolled at 80 centres in Europe, Latin America, Asia, and Australia between March 6, 2008, and Sept 9, 2009. To be eligible, patients had to have been receiving 15-25 mg of methotrexate every week for at least 8 weeks. In an open-label period of 36 weeks, all patients were given 50 mg etanercept plus methotrexate every week. To be eligible for a subsequent double-blind period of 52 weeks, participants had to have achieved sustained low disease activity. These patients were randomly assigned (1:1:1) by an interactive voice-response system to one of three treatment groups: 50 mg etanercept plus methotrexate, 25 mg etanercept plus methotrexate, or placebo plus methotrexate. Patients were stratified in blocks of three by DAS28 response (low disease activity or remission) at week 36. Patients, investigators, data analysts, and study staff were all masked to treatment allocation. The primary endpoint was the proportion of patients with low disease activity at week 88 in the groups given 50 mg etanercept or placebo in the double-blind period. A conditional primary endpoint was the proportion of patients receiving 25 mg etanercept who achieved low disease activity. Modified intention-to-treat populations were used for analyses. This trial is registered with ClinicalTrials.gov, number NCT00565409. FINDINGS: 604 (72.4%) of 834 enrolled patients were eligible for the double-blind period, of whom 202 were assigned to 50 mg etanercept plus methotrexate, 202 to 25 mg etanercept plus methotrexate, and 200 to placebo plus methotrexate. At week 88, 166 (82.6%) of 201 patients who had received at least one dose of 50 mg etanercept and one or more DAS28 evaluations had low disease activity, compared with 84 (42.6%) of 197 who had received placebo (mean difference 40.8%, 95% CI 32.5-49.1%; p<0.0001). Additionally, 159 (79.1%) of 201 patients given 25 mg etanercept had low disease activity at week 88 (mean difference from placebo 35.9%, 27.0-44.8%; p<0.0001). INTERPRETATION: Conventional or reduced doses of etanercept with methotrexate in patients with moderately active rheumatoid arthritis more effectively maintain low disease activity than does methotrexate alone after withdrawal of etanercept.

Although cytogenetic abnormalities typical of damage by cytotoxic agents were not documented, our case may be the first report of acute myeloid leukemia in RA with MTX. We estimate that 6 similar cases should have been observed in France by chance alone. The absence of other reports suggests either that MTX possesses a paradoxical protective effect or that it is not considered a risk factor for malignancy by rheumatologists. Since the number of patients with RA taking MTX can be estimated with reasonable accuracy, the reporting of all suspected cases could help to assess the safety of the drug in rheumatology.",

        "Abstract": "BACKGROUND: We assessed the effects of reduction and withdrawal of treatment in patients with rheumatoid arthritis who had a remission while receiving etanercept-plus-methotrexate therapy. METHODS: Patients with early active disease who had not previously received methotrexate or biologic therapy received 50 mg of etanercept plus methotrexate weekly for 52 weeks (open-label phase). We then randomly assigned patients who had qualifying responses at weeks 39 and 52 to receive 25 mg of etanercept plus methotrexate (combination-therapy group), methotrexate alone, or placebo for 39 weeks (double-blind phase). Patients who had qualifying responses at week 39 of the double-blind phase had all treatment withdrawn at that time and were followed to week 65 (treatment-withdrawal phase). The primary end point was the proportion of patients with sustained remission in the double-blind phase. RESULTS: Of 306 patients enrolled, 193 underwent randomization in the double-blind phase; 131 qualified for the treatment-withdrawal phase. More patients in the combination-therapy group than in the methotrexate-alone group or the placebo group met the criterion for the primary end point (40 of 63 [63%] vs. 26 of 65 [40%] and 15 of 65 [23%], respectively; P=0.009 for combination therapy vs. methotrexate alone; P<0.001 for combination therapy vs. placebo). At 65 weeks, 28 patients (44%) who had received combination therapy, 19 (29%) who had received methotrexate alone, and 15 (23%) who had received placebo were in remission (P=0.10 for combination therapy vs. methotrexate alone; P=0.02 for combination therapy vs. placebo; P=0.55 for methotrexate alone vs. placebo). No significant between-group differences were observed in radiographic progression of disease. Serious adverse events were reported in 3 patients (5%) in the combination-therapy group, 2 (3%) in the methotrexate-alone group, and 2 (3%) in the placebo group. CONCLUSIONS: In patients with early rheumatoid arthritis who had a remission while receiving full-dose etanercept-plus-methotrexate therapy, continuing combination therapy at a reduced dose resulted in better disease control than switching to methotrexate alone or placebo, but no significant difference was observed in radiographic progression.

        "Published": "2016 May",
        "Abstract": "OBJECTIVE: To study the effect of age on the risk-benefit balance of abatacept in RA. METHODS: Data from the French orencia and RA registry, including a 2-year follow-up, were used to compare the effectiveness and safety of abatacept according to age. RESULTS: Among the 1017 patients, 103 were very elderly (75 years), 215 elderly (65-74), 406 intermediate aged (50-64) and 293 very young (<50). At baseline, elderly and very elderly patients had longer disease duration, higher CRP levels and higher disease activity. These age groups showed a lower incidence of previous anti-TNF therapy and less common concomitant use of DMARDs, but a similar use of corticosteroid therapy. After adjusting for disease duration, RF\/ACPA positivity, use of DMARDs or corticosteroids and previous anti-TNF treatment, the EULAR response (good or moderate) and the remission rate were not significantly different between the four age groups. At 6 months, the very elderly had a significantly lower likelihood of a good response than the very young (odds ratio = 0.15, 95% CI: 0.03, 0.68). The decrease in DAS28-ESR over the 24-month follow-up period did not differ by age. Increasing age was associated with a higher rate of discontinuation for adverse events, especially severe infections (per 100 patient-years: 1.73 in very young, 4.65 in intermediates, 5.90 in elderly, 10.38 in very elderly; P < 0.001). CONCLUSION: The effectiveness of abatacept is not affected by age, but the increased rate of side effects, especially infections, in the elderly must be taken into account.

        "Published": "2005 Jan",
        "Abstract": "OBJECTIVE: Treatment of rheumatoid arthritis (RA) with tumor necrosis factor (TNF) antagonists is highly effective, but their mechanisms of action are not completely clear. Since anti-TNF therapy induces a decrease in synovial cellularity, this study focused on the modulation of RA synovial apoptosis following treatment with either soluble TNF receptor (etanercept) or TNF chimeric monoclonal antibody (infliximab). METHODS: Apoptosis (TUNEL and active caspase 3 staining) and cell surface markers were evaluated by immunohistochemistry in synovial biopsy samples obtained before and after 8 weeks of treatment with etanercept (12 patients) or infliximab (9 patients). We also determined by flow cytometry the in vitro effect of etanercept and infliximab on apoptosis of RA mononuclear cells derived from the synovial fluid (SF) and peripheral blood (PB). RESULTS: Eight weeks of treatment with etanercept and with infliximab significantly increased synovial apoptosis. This change was accompanied by a significant decrease in the synovial monocyte\/macrophage population. The decrease in lymphocyte numbers did not reach statistical significance. In vitro, 24 hours of incubation with either etanercept or infliximab induced apoptosis of the SF monocyte\/macrophage population. PB monocyte\/macrophages were less susceptible to anti-TNF-mediated apoptosis. No changes in the rate of apoptosis were observed in the lymphocyte population derived from either SF or PB. CONCLUSION: In RA patients, both etanercept and infliximab are able to induce cell type-specific apoptosis in the monocyte\/macrophage population. This suggests a potential pathway that would account for the diminished synovial inflammation and the decreased numbers of synovial macrophages evident after TNF blockade.",

        "Published": "2016 08",
        "Abstract": "BACKGROUND: Cardiovascular disease is important in rheumatoid arthritis (RA). Tissue factor (TF) is expressed upon platelet activation and initiates coagulation. Anti-tumour necrosis factor-alpha (TNFalpha) agents seem to decrease RA-associated cardiovascular events. We investigated whether (1) TNFalpha activates human platelets and (2) TNFalpha pharmacological blockade modulates the platelet-leucocyte reciprocal activation in RA. DESIGN: The expression of platelet TNFalpha receptors has been assessed by flow cytometry and immunogold electron microscopy. Platelet and leucocyte activation has been assessed also in the presence of antibodies against the TNFalpha receptors 1 and 2 and of infliximab. TF expression, binding to fibrinogen and phosphatidylserine exposure, has been assessed by flow cytometry, TF activity by coagulation time and by endogenous thrombin generation. Markers of platelet and leucocyte activation have been assessed in 161 subjects: 42 patients with RA, 12 with osteoarthritis, 37 age-matched and sex-matched patients with chronic stable angina and 70 age-matched and sex-matched healthy subjects. RESULTS: TNFalpha elicited the platelet activation and the expression of TF, which in turn prompted thrombin generation and clot formation. Inhibition of the TNFalpha-induced activation restricted platelet ability to activate leucocytes and to induce leucocyte TF. TNFalpha inhibition did not influence platelet activation induced by collagen, ADP or thrombin receptor activating peptide-6. Platelets of patients with RA were more activated than those of controls. Activation was reduced in patients treated with TNFalpha inhibitors. CONCLUSIONS: TNFalpha-dependent pathways control platelet activation and TF expression in RA. Further studies will verify whether the protective effect of TNFalpha inhibitors on cardiovascular events involves their ability to modulate platelet function.

        "Abstract": "OBJECTIVES: Methotrexate (MTX) has been used in several autoimmune diseases. Apart from its use in rheumatoid arthritis, MTX has been assessed in small studies in patients with vasculitis, uveitis, and inflammatory bowel disease. The aim of this study was to evaluate the efficacy of MTX in a particular group of patients with systemic lupus erythematosus (SLE). PATIENTS: In an open prospective study 22 patients fulfilling the ACR criteria for SLE were included. Patients had one or more of the following manifestations; active non-destructive polyarthritis, dermatitis, vasculitis of the skin, pleuritis. All patients had been treated with corticosteroids for at least six months without achieving remission. Sixteen patients were taking antimalarial drugs in addition to corticosteroids, which were stopped at the beginning of the trial. Patients with renal and central nervous involvement were excluded from the study. All patients received MTX orally at a dose of 15 mg\/week over six months. Corticosteroids were continued. As additional medication only indomethacin up to 100 mg\/day was permitted if used before the start of the study. The outcome was evaluated using the SLE disease activity index (SLEDAI). RESULTS: Disease activity was evaluated after six months of MTX treatment. All patients completed the study period. The SLEDAI decreased significantly from mean (SD) 12.2 (3.99) to 4 (3.75) (p = 0.001). The prednisolone dose was reduced from a mean (SD) of 17.4 (12.8) at the beginning to 8.8 (5.36) mg\/day at the end point of the study (p = 0.01). MTX was well tolerated. Four patients complained of general malaise. Two patients had transient increases in liver enzymes. In no case did MTX have to be stopped. CONCLUSIONS: In an open prospective study methotrexate was used in SLE patients with particular clinical characteristics. MTX was shown to be effective in reducing disease activity and sparing the dose of corticosteroids. Further controlled studies are necessary.",

        "Published": "2016 Sep",
        "Abstract": "Infliximab is a promising drug with good outcomes demonstrated for diseases such as inflammatory bowel disease (IBD), rheumatoid arthritis (RA) and spondyloarthropathy (SpA). However, treatment with this drug may increase the risk of tuberculosis infection. The aim of the present study was to investigate infliximab-associated tuberculosis infection. Literature searches in PubMed, MEDLINE and EMBASE databases were performed. Randomized controlled trials with >95% of the patients >18 years-old were included. Meta-analysis was performed to investigate the incidence of tuberculosis infection after infliximab infusion. A total of 24 RCTs were included in the present meta-analysis. In total, 21 (0.51%) tuberculosis infections were detected among 4,111 patients administered infliximab therapy, compared with 0 (0%) among 2,229 patients assigned to the placebo group. Pooled odds ratio (OR) of developing tuberculosis infection was significantly higher with infliximab therapy than with placebo [2.86; 95% confidence interval (CI), 1.09-7.52]. The OR of tuberculosis infection was 3.93 (95% CI, 0.91-16.91) in RA, 2.46 (95% CI, 0.38-15.92) in SpA and 1.66 (95% CI, 0.26-10.57) in IBD. Rates of tuberculosis infection with infliximab therapy in RA, SpA and IBD were 0.70, 0.22 and 0.52%, respectively. Compared with placebo, infliximab therapy may increase the risk of developing tuberculosis. However, the ORs for the risk of infliximab-associated tuberculosis were not demonstrated to be significant in IBD, RA and SpA; therefore, these findings should be interpreted with caution. The risk of developing tuberculosis demonstrates the importance of the prevention and management of tuberculosis infection with infliximab therapy.",

        "Abstract": "OBJECTIVE: To examine whether the G-to-A polymorphism at position -308 in the promoter of the tumour necrosis factor-alpha (TNFalpha) gene influences the therapeutic response to TNFalpha-blockers in patients with rheumatoid arthritis (RA), psoriatic arthritis (PsA) and ankylosing spondylitis (AS). METHODS: A total of 54 patients with RA, 10 with PsA and 22 with AS were genotyped by polymerase chain reaction for the -308 TNFalpha promoter polymorphism. They were treated with infliximab (n = 63), adalimumab (n = 10) or etanercept (n = 13). Clinical response was assessed after 24 weeks by the Disease Activity Score in 28 joints (DAS28) for RA and PsA, and the Bath Ankylosing Spondylitis Activity Index (BASDAI) for AS patients. RESULTS: All patients with the A\/A genotype (n = 3, all RA) and two patients with the A\/G genotype (AS) failed to respond to anti-TNF treatment. Irrespective of the underlying disease, moderate response (n = 44) was predominantly associated with the A\/G genotype (A\/G 18\/22, G\/G 4\/22), whereas good response (n = 59) was exclusively seen in patients with the G\/G genotype. The average improvement in the DAS28 score was 0.83 in the A\/A, 1.50 in the A\/G and 2.64 in the G\/G group of RA and PsA patients (P < 0.0001). The BASDAI score in AS improved on average by 1.21 in the A\/G and by 3.30 in the G\/G group (P < 0.005). CONCLUSIONS: The data suggest that humans with a TNFalpha -308 G\/G genotype are better responders to anti-TNFalpha treatment than those with A\/A or A\/G genotypes independent of the treated rheumatic disease (RA, PsA or AS).",

        "Abstract": "BACKGROUND: Psoriasis is a chronic, autoimmune, T-cell mediated, inflammatory disease. An improved understanding of the pathogenesis of the autoimmune response has led to the development of targeted biologic therapies. Briakinumab is a human monocolonal antibody that blocks the activity of the cytokines IL-12 and IL-23. Immune dysregulation has been implicated in multiple inflammatory disorders and briakinumab has been investigated for the treatment of psoriasis, rheumatoid arthritis, inflammatory bowel disease, and multiple sclerosis. OBJECTIVES: This review focuses on briakinumab and its use in chronic plaque-type psoriasis. METHODS: A literature review was performed, searching Medline and the clinicaltrials.gov database for all articles with the keywords ABT-874, IL-12\/IL-23 and psoriasis. CONCLUSIONS: Although limited by small sample sizes, length of follow-up, and a lack of direct comparisons with other psoriasis treatments, initial data regarding the safety and efficacy of briakinumab for the treatment of psoriasis is promising. Ongoing Phase III trials may provide additional information regarding the relative efficacy and safety of briakinumab. [References: 32]",

        "Published": "2017 08 11",
        "Abstract": "BACKGROUND: Currently, although several categories of biological disease-modifying antirheumatic drugs (bDMARDs) are available, there are few data informing selection of initial treatment for individual patients with rheumatoid arthritis (RA). Therefore, tumor necrosis factor inhibitor (TNF-i) and tocilizumab (TCZ) are treated as equivalent treatments in the recent disease management recommendations. We focused on two anticytokine therapies, TCZ and TNF-i, and aimed to develop a scoring system that predicts a better treatment for each RA patient before starting an IL-6 or a TNF-i. METHODS: The expression of IL-6 and TNF-alpha mRNA in peripheral blood from 45 newly diagnosed RA patients was measured by DNA microarrays to evaluate cytokine activation. Next, laboratory indices immediately before commencing treatment and disease activity score improvement ratio after 6 months in 98 patients treated with TCZ or TNF-i were retrospectively analyzed. Some indices correlated with TCZ efficacy were selected and their cutoff values were defined by receiver operating characteristic (ROC) analysis to develop a scoring system to discriminate between individuals more likely to respond to TCZ or TNF-i. The validity of the scoring system was verified in these 98 patients and an additional 228 patients. RESULTS: There was significant inverse correlation between the expression of IL-6 and TNF-alpha mRNA in newly diagnosed RA patients. The analysis of 98 patients revealed significant correlation between TCZ efficacy and platelet counts, hemoglobin, aspartate aminotransferase, and alanine aminotransferase; in contrast, there was no similar correlation in the TNF-i group. The cutoff values were defined by ROC analysis to develop a scoring system (1 point\/item, maximum of 4 points). A good TCZ response was predicted if the score was >=2; in contrast, TNF-i seemed to be preferable if the score was <=1. Similar results were obtained in a validation study of an additional 228 patients. If the case scored >=3, the good responder rates of TCZ\/TNF-i were 75.0%\/37.9% (p < 0.01) and the non-responder rates were 3.1%\/27.6% (p < 0.01), respectively. CONCLUSIONS: The score is easily calculated from common laboratory results. It appears useful for identifying a better treatment at the time of selecting either an IL-6 or a TNF inhibitor.",

        "Abstract": "To describe disease activity and disability during the first year of follow-up, from rheumatoid arthritis (RA) patients who discontinue tofacitinib after they end participation in a clinical trial. From 2008 to 2016, 36 patients were enrolled in the \"Long term follow-up study with tofacitinib (and methotrexate) for RA treatment\". At the end of the study, tofacitinib was discontinued and patients were proposed to enter an observational study; 35 agree and had scheduled evaluations at baseline, at 15 and 30 days of follow-up, at month 2 and 3, and thereafter every 3 months. Disease activity was evaluated as per DAS28-ESR and disability as per HAQ. During follow-up, treatment was treat-to-target oriented, only conventional DMARDs were indicated. Descriptive statistics and nonparametric test were used. The study was approved by IRB. Patients were primarily females (N = 34), had median (Q25-75) age of 52 years (45-58), and had received tofacitinib for a median of 7.9 years (6.3-8.3). The proportion of patients with remission and low disease activity decreased from day 30 of follow-up and recovered after 270 days, meanwhile patients with high disease activity increased from 0% at baseline to 6.3% at 1 year. At study entry, 20 patients had remission\/low disease activity; during follow-up, 85% deteriorated after (median) 30 days; among them, 23.5% recovered their baseline status after a median of 172.5 days. The HAQ showed a similar behavior, but 66.7% recovered. A substantial proportion of RA patients deteriorated outcomes early after tofacitinib cessation; some patients recovered baseline status with traditional DMARDS.",

        "Abstract": "Tumour necrosis factor (TNF)-alpha plays an important role in the pathogenesis of psoriasis. Infliximab is an anti-TNF-alpha chimeric monoclonal antibody, which is licensed for the treatment of rheumatoid arthritis and Crohn's disease. Some reports have shown the efficacy of infliximab, either in monotherapy or in combination with methotrexate, for the treatment of psoriatic arthropathy and psoriasis. The efficacy and tolerability of infliximab monotherapy was evaluated in 29 patients with moderate to severe psoriasis, unresponsive to conventional treatments. Fourteen patients suffered from concomitant arthropathy. Patients received intravenous infliximab, 5mg\/kg, at weeks 0, 2, and 6. After this 3-dose-induction regimen, patients were followed-up at monthly intervals and retreated with a single-dose infusion in case of relapse of signs and symptoms. Clinical assessment was performed using the psoriasis area and severity index (PASI) to monitor psoriasis activity; pruritus and joint pain were assessed on a scale of 0 to 3. A marked improvement of skin lesions and subjective symptoms was noted in the majority of patients; an excellent reduction of PASI score (> or =75%) was observed in 13.8% of cases at week 2, 71.4% at week 6 and 78.6% at week 10. During the follow-up period, some patients maintained satisfactory clinical results without requiring any additional infusions. In general, skin lesions showed a trend towards a more prolonged and sustained improvement as compared with subjective symptoms. Treatment was well tolerated and no serious adverse events occurred.",

        "Published": "2016 Dec",
        "Abstract": "PURPOSE: Tofacitinib is an oral Janus kinase inhibitor for the treatment of rheumatoid arthritis (RA). This analysis compared the efficacy and safety of tofacitinib with biologic disease-modifying antirheumatic drugs in patients with RA and a prior inadequate response (IR) to tumor necrosis factor inhibitors (TNFi). METHODS: A systematic literature review identified 5 randomized placebo-controlled trials that evaluated tofacitinib or biologic disease-modifying antirheumatic drugs (bDMARDs) against placebo in patient populations with RA with a prior IR to TNFi. The definition of TNFi-IR varied across studies, and included patients with an IR or who had failed treatment with TNFi for any reason. A network meta-analysis was conducted comparing study data with regard to American College of Rheumatology response rates and Health Assessment Questionnaire-Disability Index improvement at weeks 12 and 24, rates of treatment withdrawal due to all causes; adverse events (AEs) and lack of efficacy; and rates of AEs, serious AEs, and serious infections. FINDINGS: The 5 trials included a total of 2136 patients. Tofacitinib 5 mg twice daily combined with methotrexate was found to have relative risk estimates of American College of Rheumatology responses and change from baseline in Health Assessment Questionnaire-Disability Index score comparable with abatacept, golimumab, rituximab, and tocilizumab combined with conventional synthetic disease-modifying antirheumatic drugs. Withdrawal rates from trials due to all causes and AEs were comparable between treatments, and tofacitinib had a lower rate of withdrawals due to lack of efficacy. Rates of AEs and HAQ-DI were comparable between tofacitinib, other active treatments, and placebo. No serious infections were reported with tofacitinib during the placebo-controlled period (up to week 12) in this study population; rates of serious infection with other active treatments were generally low and similar to placebo. IMPLICATIONS: During a 24-week period, tofacitinib had efficacy and rates of AEs comparable with currently available bDMARDs in the treatment of patients with RA who had a prior IR to TNFi.

Rituximab is a biologic agent that depletes peripheral B cells--an action thought to reduce rheumatoid arthritis activity--and induces prolonged clinical improvement. Two 1000-mg infusions administered 2 weeks apart can result in a response that lasts for months. Most patients will require retreatment, but the effect of repeated dosing on patient outcomes has not yet been determined. Combination therapy with methotrexate is recommended as this appears to achieve the best outcomes. Rituximab also has been shown to be safe, although the lack of long-term efficacy and safety data limit its use. More studies are needed, but this agent has been demonstrated to be safe and effective in patients who fail to achieve adequate clinical response to methotrexate and tumor necrosis factor-alpha inhibitors.

        "Published": "2006 Jan",
        "Abstract": "BACKGROUND: Treatment with infliximab induces a rapid therapeutic response in most patients with active rheumatoid arthritis. Factors predicting good response are not well known. OBJECTIVE: To study the predictive value of baseline level of soluble interleukin 2 receptor (sIL2R), a marker of lymphocyte activation, on the treatment response. METHODS: 24 patients with active rheumatoid arthritis received intravenous infusions of infliximab at study entry, at two weeks, at six weeks, and at eight week intervals thereafter. Outcome was evaluated at six weeks and 22 weeks. Clinical assessment and standard laboratory tests were made and the DAS28 disease activity score was calculated. Serum sIL2R level at entry was measured by automated immunoassay analyser (Immulite). The mean change in DAS28 score from entry to six weeks and 22 weeks was calculated and related to sIL2R level using baseline adjusted robust regression analysis. RESULTS: Baseline level of serum sIL2R (mean (SD), 621 (325) U\/ml) did not correlate with baseline DAS28 score (r = 0.24 (95% confidence interval, -0.18 to 0.58)). At six weeks DAS28 scores improved, with a mean change of -2.53 (-3.08 to -1.98) (p<0.001). This change was predicted by low baseline sIL2R level (regression coefficient per 100 U\/ml: 0.205 (0.003 to 0.407) (p = 0.047)). At 22 weeks the DAS28 scores improved, with a mean change of -2.26 (-2.75 to -1.77) (p<0.001). The change was not predicted by baseline sIL2R level. CONCLUSIONS: Low baseline sIL2R level may predict a rapid clinical response in patients with refractory rheumatoid arthritis treated with infliximab.",

The most frequent adverse drug reactions were leucopenia, trombocytopenia, skin reactions and gastrointestinal disorders as vomiting, melaena, epigastrial pain, etc. The primary risk connected with long therapy of low doses MTX is hepatotoxicity that diagnose and treatment are painful and expensive. As a result of the appearance of ADR in 5 patients the therapy with MTX was not changed, in two cases MTX is stopped timely or the dosage is changed and in the rest 11 patients MTX was excluded from the therapeutic scheme.",

        "Published": "2009",
        "Abstract": "INTRODUCTION: Co-stimulatory signal B7(CD80\/CD86):CD28 is needed in order to activate T cells in immune response. Cytotoxic T lymphocyte-associated antigen-4-immunoglobulin (CTLA4-Ig) binding to the B7 molecules on antigen-presenting cells downregulates this activation and represents a recent biological treatment in rheumatoid arthritis (RA). Objectives of the study were to investigate the presence of the B7.2 (CD86) molecule and its masking by CTLA4-Ig on cultures of both RA synovial macrophages (RA SM), and of macrophages differentiated from THP-1 cells (M). In addition, the anti-inflammatory effects of CTLA4-Ig on co-cultures of RA SM and M with activated T cells were tested. METHODS: All macrophages were co-cultured for 24 hours with activated T cells, without or with CTLA4-Ig (10, 100, 500 microg\/ml for 1 hour, 3 hours and overnight, respectively). Immunofluorescence (IF) staining for B7.2, and an analysis of inflammatory cytokine expression (interleukin (IL) -6, tumor necrosis factor (TNF) alpha, IL-1beta, transforming growth factor (TGF) beta) by immunocytochemistry (ICC), western blot (WB) and reverse transcriptase-polymerase chain reaction (RT-PCR) were performed. RESULTS: Macrophages showed intense B7.2 expression. CTLA4-Ig\/B7.2 masking was evident for all macrophages, even after only 1 hour of cell culture (range from 10 to 100 microg\/ml). ICC of co-cultures showed a dose-dependent decrease in inflammatory cytokines (P < 0.001 for IL-6, TNFalpha, IL-1beta and TGFbeta). Data were confirmed by WB and RT-PCR analysis. CONCLUSIONS: Optimal concentrations of CTLA4-Ig for the CTLA4-Ig\/B7.2 masking on activated macrophages were identified and were found to induce significant downregulation in the cell production of IL-6, TNFalpha, IL1-beta and TGFbeta. In conclusion, macrophages would appear to be a sensitive target for CTLA4-Ig treatment in RA.",

        "Abstract": "We sought to investigate whether clinical improvement after immunosuppressive treatment reflects changes in acute phase response (APR) in rheumatoid arthritis (RA). Fifty-eight patients (pts) were treated with methotrexate (MTX), nineteen with intravenous cyclophosphamide (CTX), and fifteen with cyclosporin A (CSA). C-reactive protein (CRP), alpha-1-acid glycoprotein (AGP), alpha-1 antichymotrypsin (ACT), and alpha-1 antitrypsin (AT) serum levels were measured by nephelometry or rocket immunoelectrophoresis. Clinical improvement was observed in 67% MTX pts, 53% CTX pts, and 47% CSA pts. Baseline serum levels of CRP, AGP, ACT, and AT were significantly higher as compared to healthy controls. After MTX and CTX therapy CRP level significantly decreased. The decrease in serum level of ACT and AT in CTX treated patients was also observed. All analyzed acute phase proteins remained substantially elevated after CSA therapy despite a clear reduction in disease activity. We established a correlation between changes in disease activity and all acute phase proteins (APP) in MTX and CTX pts. From our study we can conclude that clinical improvement after immunosuppressive treatment correlated with quantitative changes in all APR markers in MTX and CTX treated pts, and none in CSA pts. Although measurement of APP remains the best marker for monitoring RA pts, not always they properly reflect changes in disease activity.",

        "Published": "1998 Apr",
        "Abstract": "Methotrexate is the most widely used second-line treatment in rheumatoid arthritis because of its excellent efficacy and safety profile. However, since 1991, about 100 cases of lymphoproliferative disorders have been reported in rheumatoid arthritis patients under methotrexate therapy. Four characteristics similar to those in lymphomas associated with immunodeficiency were identified during a review of the 48 cases for which detailed information is available. (1) Most cases were non-Hodgkin's B-cell lymphomas of the large cell or diffuse mixed type. (2) Extranodal involvement (55% of cases) was unusually common. (3) Evidence of Epstein-Barr infection was found in 46% of tested patients. (4) Of the 14 patients treated by methotrexate withdrawal alone, eight achieved a full remission, with follow-ups ranging from one to five years. These characteristics suggest a role for two factors: (1) the abnormalities in cell-mediated immunity seen in rheumatoid arthritis may promote latent Epstein-Barr virus infection, which may in turn lead to proliferation of malignant lymphoid cells; (2) the immunomodulatory effects of methotrexate may promote the development not only of opportunistic infections but also of Epstein-Barr virus-related lymphoproliferative disorders. There is no firm evidence to date that methotrexate has a direct oncogenic effect and no excess in malignant diseases has been reported with this drug. In conclusion, the rate of occurrence of lymphoproliferative disorders induced by low-dose methotrexate therapy remains controversial, although the characteristics of the malignancies and the possibility of a complete remission after methotrexate withdrawal militate against a chance association. Epidemiologic and other studies are needed to clarify this issue. [References: 82]",

        "Abstract": "Rheumatoid arthritis (RA) is an inflammatory autoimmune disease that can present different extrarticular manifestations involving heart, lungs and kidneys. In recent years there has been a growing awareness of the central role played by the lungs in the onset and progression of RA. In particular interstitial lung disease (ILD) is a common pulmonary manifestation that may be related to the inflammatory process itself, infectious complications and to the treatments used. Management of patients with ILD\/RA is still a challenge for clinicians, both synthetic [mainly methotrexate (MTX), leflunomide] and biologic immunosuppressors [mainly anti-tumor necrosis factor (TNF)alpha] have in fact been related to the onset or worsening of lung diseases with conflicting data. Here we report the case of a 61-year-old male patient with severely active early RA, previously treated with MTX, who developed subacute ILD, along with a review of ILD\/RA topic. Tocilizumab (humanized monoclonal antibody against the interleukin-6 receptor) was introduced on the basis of its effectiveness in RA without concomitant MTX and the ability to overcome the profibrotic effects of interleukin (IL)-6. After 3 months of treatment the clinical condition of the patient strongly improved until it reached low disease activity. He no longer complained of cough and dyspnea and bilateral basal crackles were no more present. Considering its distinctive features, tocilizumab, in such a challenging clinical condition, appears to be a safe and effective therapy, thus it enables RA remission without deteriorating ILD, at 1-year follow up, as confirmed by ultrasonography of the affected joints and chest high-resolution computed tomography (HRCT).",

        "Title": "Rituximab therapy in rheumatoid arthritis in daily practice",
        "Published": "2008 Jan",
        "Abstract": "OBJECTIVE: Rituximab has been shown to be effective in refractory rheumatoid arthritis (RA) in randomized controlled trials, allowing approval by health agencies. Our aim was to assess in routine care the effects of rituximab in patients with RA who had experienced an inadequate response to anti-tumor necrosis factor-alpha (TNF-alpha) agents or had a contraindication to these drugs. METHODS: An observational retrospective study was conducted. Rituximab (1000 mg intravenous infusion on Days 1 and 15) was administered with concomitant methotrexate therapy. Responses defined according to the European League Against Rheumatism (EULAR criteria) were assessed at Week 24. RESULTS: Fifty patients were included: 30 had inadequate response to anti-TNF-alpha and 20 had contraindication to anti-TNF-a drugs. EULAR response was observed in 82%, good response in 36% (including remission in 12%), moderate response in 46%, and no response in 18%. One infusion-related reaction and 2 pulmonary infections occurred. Eleven of the 50 patients (22%) experienced flare and received retreatment with rituximab at 6 months. Thirty additional patients had flare after 6 months and the median delay for retreatment among the 41 responders was 9 (range 6 24) months. No difference regarding efficacy or tolerance of rituximab was observed according to previous inadequate response or contraindication to anti-TNF. CONCLUSION: A single cycle of rituximab, in combination with continued methotrexate, provided significant improvement in disease activity at Week 24, with good tolerance, in patients with severe and active RA despite anti-TNF-alpha agents and\/or with contraindication to these drugs, in this daily practice study.",

        "Published": "2011 Jun",
        "Abstract": "OBJECTIVE: To conduct a meta-analysis of the rates of serious infection and malignancy in patients with early rheumatoid arthritis (RA) who have started anti-tumor necrosis factor (anti-TNF) therapy and had not received treatment with disease-modifying antirheumatic drugs (DMARDs) or methotrexate (MTX). METHODS: A systematic literature search was conducted through the summer of 2009. All studies included were randomized, double-blind, placebo-controlled trials involving patients with early RA who were started on anti-TNF therapy without prior DMARD\/MTX use. Six trials met the inclusion criteria for the meta-analysis, comprising a total of 2,183 patients receiving biologic therapy and 1,236 patients receiving MTX. The data extracted were from published trials. RESULTS: A pooled odds ratio (OR) (determined using Mantel-Haenszel methods, with a continuity correction designed for sparse data) was calculated for serious infections (requiring hospitalization) and malignancies, comparing anti-TNF therapy to MTX control. The pooled OR for serious infections was 1.28 (95% confidence interval [95% CI] 0.82-2.00) and that for malignancies was 1.08 (95% CI 0.50-2.32). There was no significant difference in either the rate of serious infections or the rate of malignancies between the anti-TNF therapy group and the control group. CONCLUSION: Whereas other meta-analyses have shown an increased risk of serious infection and malignancy in patients receiving anti-TNF therapy, the results of the present meta-analysis show that there is not an increased risk when the patients have early disease and have not previously been treated with DMARDs and\/or MTX.

        "Published": "2014 Jan",
        "Abstract": "BACKGROUND: PATIENTS with rheumatoid arthritis (RA) are at increased risk of developing comorbid conditions. OBJECTIVES: To evaluate the prevalence of comorbidities and compare their management in RA patients from different countries worldwide. METHODS: STUDY DESIGN: international, cross-sectional. PATIENTS: consecutive RA patients. DATA COLLECTED: demographics, disease characteristics (activity, severity, treatment), comorbidities (cardiovascular, infections, cancer, gastrointestinal, pulmonary, osteoporosis and psychiatric disorders). RESULTS: Of 4586 patients recruited in 17 participating countries, 3920 were analysed (age, 56+\/-13 years; disease duration, 10+\/-9 years (mean+\/-SD); female gender, 82%; DAS28 (Disease Activity Score using 28 joints)-erythrocyte sedimentation rate, 3.7+\/-1.6 (mean+\/-SD); Health Assessment Questionnaire, 1.0+\/-0.7 (mean+\/-SD); past or current methotrexate use, 89%; past or current use of biological agents, 39%. The most frequently associated diseases (past or current) were: depression, 15%; asthma, 6.6%; cardiovascular events (myocardial infarction, stroke), 6%; solid malignancies (excluding basal cell carcinoma), 4.5%; chronic obstructive pulmonary disease, 3.5%. High intercountry variability was observed for both the prevalence of comorbidities and the proportion of subjects complying with recommendations for preventing and managing comorbidities. The systematic evaluation of comorbidities in this study detected abnormalities in vital signs, such as elevated blood pressure in 11.2%, and identified conditions that manifest as laboratory test abnormalities, such as hyperglycaemia in 3.3% and hyperlipidaemia in 8.3%. CONCLUSIONS: Among RA patients, there is a high prevalence of comorbidities and their risk factors. In this multinational sample, variability among countries was wide, not only in prevalence but also in compliance with recommendations for preventing and managing these comorbidities. Systematic measurement of vital signs and laboratory testing detects otherwise unrecognised comorbid conditions.",

        "Abstract": "OBJECTIVE: To evaluate the efficacy and safety of orally administered once-daily peficitinib in combination with limited conventional synthetic disease-modifying antirheumatic drugs (csDMARDs) in patients with moderate-to-severe rheumatoid arthritis (RA). METHODS: In this randomized, double-blind, phase IIb trial, patients with RA (n = 289) were treated with peficitinib 25 mg, 50 mg, 100 mg, or 150 mg or matching placebo once daily for 12 weeks. The primary end point was the percentage of patients who met the American College of Rheumatology 20% improvement criteria (achieved an ACR20 response) at week 12. RESULTS: ACR20 response rates at week 12 were 22.0%, 36.8%, 48.3% (P < 0.05), 56.3% (P < 0.01), and 29.4% in the peficitinib 25 mg, 50 mg, 100 mg, 150 mg, and placebo groups, respectively. Patients in the peficitinib 100 mg and 150 mg groups achieved a rapid and statistically significant ACR20 response compared with those in the placebo group (P < 0.05), reaching statistical significance by week 2. Overall, the incidence of adverse events (AEs) was similar between patients receiving peficitinib and those receiving placebo. The most common AEs were upper respiratory tract infection (5% [n = 15]), nausea (4% [n = 12]), and urinary tract infection (4% [n = 10]). There was 1 case of herpes zoster in the placebo group, and 1 serious infection (limb abscess) in the peficitinib 25 mg group. There were no incidences of grade 2 or higher neutropenia or lymphopenia. CONCLUSION: In patients with moderate-to-severe RA, orally administered once-daily peficitinib in combination with limited csDMARDs resulted in a dose-dependent ACR20 response rate over 12 weeks with satisfactory tolerability.

        "Abstract": "OBJECTIVE: To assess the efficacy of low-dose oral methotrexate (MTX) therapy for children with severe iritis. METHODS: MTX in a weekly dose of 7.25 to 12.5 mg\/m2 was administered orally to four patients (two with juvenile rheumatoid arthritis [JRA] and two with sarcoidosis) with severe iritis not adequately controlled by topical and systemic corticosteroid therapy. The treatment was initiated with half of the total dose and increased every 2 weeks until the final dose was reached. Iritis was graded from 0 to +4 according to the density of cells in the anterior chamber of the eye. RESULTS: There were three girls and one boy with a mean age of 10.5 years. Two patients were African American and two were Caucasian. The mean age at onset of iritis was 6 years. The mean duration of MTX therapy was 28.8 months. Significant improvement was noted in two of the four patients in ocular inflammation, demonstrated by reduction of cell density from +4 to +1. Two patients had a mild improvement of the iritis. However, corticosteroids were significantly reduced in all patients. One patient was completely off steroids within 30 months of MTX therapy. In the remaining three cases, the steroid dose was successfully tapered from 0.82 mg\/kg\/d to 0.15 mg\/kg\/d (mean doses) within a mean duration of 20 months. No side effects were observed with MTX therapy. CONCLUSION: Low-dose MTX therapy was effective and safe, and displayed steroid-sparing properties in four children with severe iritis.",

        "Published": "2014 Sep",
        "Abstract": "BACKGROUND: Graft-versus-host disease (GVHD) is a rare, serious, fatal disease that occurs after orthotopic liver transplantation (OLT). CASE REPORT: We treated a 60-year-old man who underwent OLT owing to familial amyloidosis. The patient developed fever on postoperative day 16. The fever was persistent and did not respond to antibiotic therapy. Cultures and radiologic studies were done and excluded infection as a potential cause. On postoperative day 26, a skin rash appeared on his chest, accompanied by diarrhea and persistent fever. The rash spread all over the trunk, neck, and arms, but spared the palms of his hands and soles of his feet. In the meantime, his blood cell count revealed pancytopenia. Skin biopsy was done and showed interface lymphocytic infiltrate that are largely centered on the dermal-epidermal junction, is consistent with GVHD (this pattern of rash distribution is unique and different from the rash of GVHD after hematopoietic stem cell transplant, which is confined to palms of the hands and soles of the feet; Fig 1). The diagnosis was confirmed by colonoscopy and multiple forceps biopsies, which revealed extensive crypt loss. After hematology consultation, the patient was treated by withdrawal of all immunosuppressive therapy coupled with abatacept infusion. Abatacept is a chimeric protein that inhibits T-lymphocytes and is approved by the US Food and Drug Administration for the treatment of rheumatoid arthritis. Interestingly, after second dose of abatacept the patient showed marked clinical and laboratory improvement. The patient was discharged after 47 days in a stable condition. CONCLUSION: Because of the lack of a consensus for treatment of these patients, we report our experience with a male patient who had post-OLT GVHD and showed a marked improvement in response to abatacept.

        "Abstract": "In this transglobal, randomized, double-blind, placebo-controlled, treat-to-target study, the maintenance of efficacy was compared between biologic-and biologic-free-disease-modifying antirheumatic drug (DMARD) combination regimens after low disease activity (LDA) was achieved with biologic DMARD induction therapy. Patients with moderate-to-severe rheumatoid arthritis despite methotrexate therapy received open-label etanercept 50 mg subcutaneously once weekly plus methotrexate with or without other conventional synthetic (cs) DMARDs for 24 weeks. Patients achieving LDA [disease activity score in 28 joints based on erythrocyte sedimentation rate (DAS28-ESR) <3.2] at week 24 were randomized to receive etanercept-methotrexate combination therapy or placebo-methotrexate combination therapy, with or without other csDMARDs, for 28 weeks. In the open-label period, 72% of patients achieved DAS28-ESR LDA at week 24. Patients enrolled in the double-blind period had long-standing rheumatoid arthritis and high disease activity at baseline (mean duration, 8.1 years; DAS28-ESR, 6.4). In the etanercept and placebo combination groups, 44% versus 17% achieved DAS28-ESR LDA and 34 versus 13% achieved DAS28-ESR remission at week 52 (p < 0.001). Adverse events were reported in 37 and 43%, serious adverse events in 0 and 4%, and serious infections in 0 and 2% in these groups, respectively, in the double-blind period. After induction of response with etanercept combination therapy following a treat-to-target approach in patients with long-standing rheumatoid arthritis and high disease activity at baseline, the etanercept combination regimen was significantly more effective in maintaining LDA and remission than a biologic-free regimen.

        "Abstract": "The aim of the study was to assess the proportion of German patients with rheumatoid arthritis (RA) who received biological disease-modifying antirheumatic drugs (DMARDs) after initiation of conventional DMARD therapy. Patients aged 18 years or over who had initiated therapy with a conventional DMARD in a rheumatic care practice between 2009 and 2013 were included (IMS LRx database). The main outcome was the first prescription of a biological DMARD within 5 years following the index date. A multivariate Cox regression model was adopted to predict the prescription of biological DMARDs on the basis of patient characteristics. The mean age of the 137,673 patients with RA was 57.8 years (SD = 15.0). 68.3 % of the subjects were women. Most patients started their conventional DMARD therapy with methotrexate (62 %), sulfasalazine (13 %), and hydroxychloroquine (12 %). 20.7 % of the RA patients were given a biological DMARD within 5 years following the index date. Male gender was linked with a 10 % higher likelihood of biologic use whereas age decreased the odds of biological DMARD prescription by 3 % per year. Finally, leflunomide use was associated with increased odds of biologic prescription, whereas sulfasalazine and hydroxychloroquine decreased the chances of receiving biologics, as compared to methotrexate. Around 20 % of patients were being treated with biologics 5 years after prescription of conventional DMARDs. Gender, age, and initial treatment impacted the proportion of subjects treated with biological DMARDs.",

        "Abstract": "OBJECTIVE: An analysis of a clinical trial to assess the effects of treatment reduction and withdrawal on patient-reported outcomes (PRO) in patients with early, moderate to severe rheumatoid arthritis (RA) who achieved 28-joint Disease Activity Score (DAS28) low disease activity (LDA) or remission with etanercept (ETN) plus methotrexate (MTX) therapy. METHODS: During treatment induction, patients received open-label ETN 50 mg weekly plus MTX for 52 weeks. In the reduced-treatment phase, patients with DAS28-erythrocyte sedimentation rate (ESR) <= 3.2 at Week 39 and DAS28-ESR < 2.6 at Week 52 in the open-label phase were randomized to double-blind treatment with ETN 25 mg plus MTX, MTX, or placebo (PBO) for 39 weeks (weeks 0-39). In the third phase, patients who achieved DAS28 remission (DAS28-ESR < 2.6) or LDA (2.6 <= DAS28-ESR <= 3.2) at Week 39 in the double-blind phase had all treatment withdrawn and were observed for an additional 26 weeks (weeks 39-65). RESULTS: Of the 306 patients enrolled, 193 were randomized in the double-blind phase and 131 participated in the treatment-withdrawal phase. After reduction or withdrawal of ETN 50 mg\/MTX, patients reduced to ETN 25 mg\/MTX experienced slight, nonsignificant declines in the majority of PRO measures, whereas switching to PBO or MTX alone caused significant declines. Presenteeism and activity impairment scores were significantly better in the ETN reduced-dose group versus MTX monotherapy and PBO at Week 39 (p <= 0.05). CONCLUSION: In patients with early RA who achieved remission while receiving full-dose ETN\/MTX, continuing combination therapy at a lower dose did not cause a significant worsening of PRO response, but switching to MTX alone or PBO did.

        "Abstract": "OBJECTIVE: The purpose of this study was to identify the effects of concomitant use of MTX and baseline characteristics for remission in the treatment of RA with tocilizumab (TCZ) in daily clinical practice. METHODS: A total of 240 RA patients who received TCZ were selected from the multicentre Tsurumai Biologics Communication Registry. Predictive baseline factors for remission [28-item DAS (DAS28) < 2.6] at 52 weeks were determined by logistic regression analysis. To confirm whether the associations varied by the level of baseline disease activity, we also assessed the model including the interaction term (each baseline variable x DAS28). RESULTS: In total, 49.3% of the study participants used MTX with TCZ. Even after controlling for the baseline DAS28, shorter disease duration (<=3 year) [odds ratio (OR) 3.58 (95% CI 1.81, 7.07)], less structural damage [Steinbroker stage <=II, OR 2.33 (95% CI 1.32, 4.12)] and concomitant prednisolone use [OR 0.38 (95% CI 0.21, 0.68)] showed significant predictive values for remission.

In patients with high baseline disease activity (DAS28 > 5.1), concomitant MTX use was associated with increased odds for remission [adjusted OR for all baseline variables 2.54 (95% CI 1.11, 5.83)], while no association was indicated between them in patients with low to moderate baseline disease activity (DAS28 <= 5.1). CONCLUSION: Concomitant MTX use is an important component of TCZ treatment for RA patients with high disease activity. Copyright © The Author 2014.

        "Published": "2011 Jan",
        "Abstract": "OBJECTIVES: Clinical registries have shown their effectiveness in capturing the long-term benefit of drugs in routine care. In France, two types of registry have been established to analyse the safety and efficacy of biological agents. METHODS: The Research Axed on Tolerance of Biotherapies (RATIO) registry was designed to prospectively collect all cases of lymphoma and opportunistic infections occurring in patients receiving anti-TNF blockers for any indication. We also examined the results from nationwide prospective cohorts in order to investigate the safety and efficacy of rituximab (RTX), abatacept (ABA) and tocilizumab in RA and other autoimmune diseases. RESULTS: Analysis of the RATIO registry demonstrated an increased risk of Legionella pneumophila infection in patients receiving anti-TNF therapy, a higher risk of tuberculosis [odds ratio (OR) (95% CI): 13.3 (2.6, 69.0) and 17.1 (3.6, 80.6) for infliximab and adalimumab vs etanercept, respectively], opportunistic infections and incidence of lymphoma, with mAb than with soluble-receptor anti-TNF. The characteristics of RA patients in RTX and ABA registries showed that some patients did not receive previous TNF blockers [20% in autoimmunity and RTX (AIR) and 13% in Orencia and RA (ORA)] and one-third of them were treated without concomitant DMARDs. Patients receiving RTX showed an increased proportion of severe infections (5.0\/100 patient-years). Lung and cardiac comorbidities, extra-articular involvement and low immunoglobulin G before RTX were predictive factors of severe infections. In addition, the AIR registry suggested the effectiveness of RTX in patients with SLE. CONCLUSION: The establishment of biological registries in rheumatic diseases, in France, with their different methods, has already provided additional data to controlled trials, mainly on the risk of severe infections and lymphoma.",

        "Published": "2011",
        "Abstract": "Combination of disease-modifying antirheumatic drugs (DMARDs) is increasingly used in the treatment of rheumatoid arthritis (RA) patients. Hepatotoxicity has been an important safety concern with DMARDs therapy. Though leflunomide (CAS 75706-12-6) has emerged as an effective oral DMARD, its use is associated with hepatotoxicity. Limited data is available regarding hepatotoxic risk when leflunomide is used in combination therapy in RA patients. An open-label, prospective study was conducted to evaluate the hepatotoxic risk after addition of leflunomide with other DMARDs in RA patients, who did not respond to their ongoing DMARD therapy. A total of 46 patients were enrolled and leflunomide was given as add-on therapy with earlier DMARDs. Biochemical parameters of serum aminotransferase levels (AST and ALT) were estimated at the baseline and then every month after addition of leflunomide. Study results showed that 13.0% patients developed > 1.5 to < 2 times upper limit of normal (ULN) elevation; 6.5% patients developed > 2 to < 3 times the ULN elevation and 2.2% patients developed > 3 times the ULN elevation. In 20% of the patients with hepatic enzyme elevations, enzyme levels returned to normal within 4-6 weeks after discontinuation of leflunomide therapy, whereas in 50% of patients the dose of leflunomide was reduced from 20 mg\/day to 10 mg\/day for normalization of enzymes levels. 30% of patients were continued with leflunomide without dose reduction. None of the patients showed clinical signs and symptoms of hepatotoxicity. Leflunomide therapy with other DMARDs requires strict monitoring of serum aminotransferases.",

        "Published": "2002 Nov",
        "Abstract": "OBJECTIVE: To quantify bone mineral density (BMD) in men with rheumatoid arthritis (RA) and to evaluate the influence of various disease-specific and non-disease-specific variables on bone mass. METHODS: Dual energy x-ray absorptiometry was performed in 104 male patients with RA and BMD was measured in lumbar spine, femoral neck, trochanter, and Ward's triangle. Inflammatory activity, measured as Disease Activity Score including 28 joints (DAS28), degree of functional impairment measured with the Health Assessment Questionnaire, and sex hormones (bioavailable testosterone, DHEAS, estradiol, and estrone) were estimated. Presence of erosions, rheumatoid factor, and current treatment as well as body mass index and smoking habits were recorded. Correlations were performed with nonparametric tests and multiple regression analyses. RESULTS: BMD was reduced in both spine and hip compared to an age matched reference population. Erosive disease was the variable with the strongest correlation with BMD. Treatment with sulfasalazine correlated positively with BMD at 3 of the 5 measured bone sites. However, in multivariate analysis significance was sustained only in the trochanter region. There were no correlations between the degree of inflammation, levels of sex hormones, treatment with corticosteroids, or smoking and BMD at any site measured. CONCLUSION: A large proportion of the men with RA had reduced bone mass. Sex hormone levels and treatment with corticosteroid did not influence BMD, nor did current degree of disease activity. Erosive disease was closely correlated with low BMD, whereas sulfasalazine was associated with high BMD at least in the trochanter region.",

        "Published": "2000",
        "Abstract": "OBJECTIVES: To assess the short-term effects of cyclophosphamide for the treatment of rheumatoid arthritis. SEARCH STRATEGY: We searched the Cochrane Musculoskeletal Group's Register, the Cochrane Controlled Trials Register (issue 3, 2000), Medline and Embase up to and including August 2000. We also carried out a handsearch of the reference lists of the trials retrieved from the electronic search. SELECTION CRITERIA: All randomized controlled trials (RCTs) and controlled clinical trials (CCTs) comparing oral cyclophosphamide against placebo (or an active drug at a dosage considered to be ineffective) in patients with rheumatoid arthritis. DATA COLLECTION AND ANALYSIS: Data abstraction was carried out independently by two reviewers. The same two reviewers using a validated checklist (Jadad 1996) assessed the methodological quality of the RCTs and CCTs. Rheumatoid arthritis outcome measures were extracted from the publications for baseline and end-of-study. The pooled analysis was performed using standardized mean differences (SMDs) for joint counts. Weighted mean differences (WMDs) were used for erythrocyte sedimentation rate (ESR). Toxicity was evaluated with pooled odds ratios for withdrawals. A chi-square test was used to assess heterogeneity among trials. Fixed effects models were used throughout. MAIN RESULTS: A total of 70 patients were included in the pooled analysis of two trials, 31 receiving cyclophosphamide. A statistically significant benefit was observed for cyclophosphamide when compared to placebo for tender and swollen joint scores: SMDs were -0.57 and -0.59 respectively. The difference in ESR also favoured the active drug but did not reach statistical significance (-12 mm, 95%CI: -26 to 2.5). One trial reported the number of patients developing new or worse erosions: the OR for cyclophosphamide compared to placebo was 0.17 (95% CI: 0.05 to 0.57). Patients receiving placebo were six times more likely to discontinue treatment because of lack of efficacy than patients receiving cyclophosphamide. Withdrawals from adverse reactions were higher in the cyclophosphamide group (Odds ratio=2.9), although this difference was not statistically significant. Side effects from cyclophosphamide included hemorrhagic cystitis, nausea, vomiting, leucopenia, thrombocytopenia, alopecia, amenorrhea and herpes zoster infections. REVIEWER'S CONCLUSIONS: Cyclophosphamide appears to have a clinically and statistically significant benefit on the disease activity of patients with RA, similar to some disease modifying antirheumatic drugs (DMARDs) such as antimalarials or sulfasalazine, but lower than methotrexate. Toxicity however is severe, limiting its use given the low benefit-risk ratio compared to other antirheumatic agents. [References: 17]",

        "Published": "2016 Oct",
        "Abstract": "OBJECTIVES: The aim of this study was to compare three measurement methods for non-adherence to DMARDs in early arthritis patients: the Compliance Questionnaire Rheumatology (CQR), the intracellular uptake of MTX in the form of MTX-polyglutamates (MTX-PGs) and electronic measurement with Medication Event Monitoring Systems (MEMS). METHODS: DMARD naive early arthritis patients were included in an ongoing cohort study. MEMS were used to measure adherence continuously, while every 3 months MTX-PGs were collected together with the CQR. The associations between the measures were estimated with Spearman rank correlations. Sensitivity and specificity of the CQR against a MEMS cut-off was compared at 3, 6, 9 and 12 months. The same applied to MTX-PGs against a MEMS cut-off and MTX-PGs against a CQR cut-off. For the association between MEMS, the CQR and MTX-PGs, a multilevel linear regression model was performed with age, gender, weeks of treatment and MTX dosage as covariates. RESULTS: We included 206 patients. Non-adherence measured with MEMS varied over time and between DMARDs. The CQR score was not associated with MEMS non-adherence at 3, 9 and 12 months. At 9 months, MTX-PGs was associated with MEMS non-adherence, as well as with the CQR. All correlations were below 0.30. CONCLUSION: Associations between the three measures are weak. Explanations are individual differences in the uptake of MTX, and little variance in adherence between patients. Moreover, the measurement domains differ: perceptions (CQR), behaviour (MEMS) and pharmacokinetics (MTX). Copyright © The Author 2016.

        "Published": "2011 Dec",
        "Abstract": "OBJECTIVE: To examine blood B cell subsets in patients with rheumatoid arthritis (RA) prior to B cell depletion therapy and to assess their potential as predictors of clinical response to rituximab (RTX). METHODS: Blood B cell subsets were assessed by flow cytometry in 208 RA patients included in an RTX retreatment study (assessed prior to RTX treatment) and in 47 age-matched controls. Expression of BAFF receptor (BAFF-R) on B cells and serum B cell biomarkers was also measured. B cell subsets and BAFF-R expression were compared between RA patient and control populations. Univariate and multivariate analyses were performed to identify baseline factors associated with a European League Against Rheumatism response 24 weeks after 1 cycle of RTX. RESULTS: Mean +\/- SD counts of both CD27- naive and CD27+ memory B cells were decreased in RA patients (188.6 +\/- 121.4\/mm(3)) compared with controls (257.3 +\/- 154.1\/mm(3)) (P = 0.001) and were partially restored in patients treated with methotrexate (MTX) plus anti-tumor necrosis factor compared with patients treated with MTX alone. Within the CD27+ memory B cells, the CD27+IgD- switched memory subtype was selectively decreased, irrespective of treatment. The frequency of CD27+ memory B cells correlated inversely with levels of several B cell activation biomarkers in RA. Serum BAFF level and BAFF-R expression was comparable in RA patients and controls. A low baseline CD27+ memory B cell frequency was associated with a greater clinical response to RTX (odds ratio 0.97 [95% confidence interval 0.95-0.99], P = 0.0015). CONCLUSION: In B cell depletion therapy-naive RA patients, a low frequency of CD27+ memory B cells correlated with levels of serum B cell activation biomarkers and may predict response to RTX. These results suggest that low memory B cell frequency may be indicative of a B cell-driven RA subtype that is more sensitive to B cell depletion therapy.

        "Published": "2001 May",
        "Abstract": "The concept suggesting the involvement of the proinflammatory cytokine tumor necrosis factor (TNF)-alpha in the pathogenesis of rheumatoid arthritis (RA) has been demonstrated by several clinical trials targeting TNF-alpha. In addition to reduction of pain and swelling, a dramatic effect of TNF blocking therapies on the progression of joint destruction was shown. Nevertheless, complete remissions of the disease are rare even with these powerful therapeutic agents, and the optimal doses and dosage intervals of TNF blockers remain to be determined. Some insights into the pathogenesis of RA are provided by studying the effects of therapeutic TNF blockade on the biology of the disease. The fact that inflammation is not completely halted and destruction is ongoing in some patients suggests that other mechanisms may also be involved, including other cytokines such as interleukin-1 and interleukin-6. In addition to the necessity of understanding the pathogenic events proximal to TNF-alpha induction, pharmacologic intervention with small molecules in the TNF signaling pathways may constitute a promising strategy.

        "Published": "2010 Oct",
        "Abstract": "BACKGROUND: Abatacept, a soluble human fusion protein that selectively modulates the costimulatory signal required for full T-cell activation, is approved for the treatment of rheumatoid arthritis (RA) in the United States, Canada, and the European Union. Because rare but serious adverse effects have been associated with biologic therapies, it is important to assess the safety profiles of these agents on an ongoing basis. OBJECTIVE: This article reviews current evidence on the safety profile of abatacept in patients with RA. METHODS: PubMed\/MEDLINE was searched for clinical trials of abatacept using the terms abatacept OR CTLA4Ig, rheumatoid arthritis, and safety. Searches of abstracts presented at the 2007-2009 annual meetings of the American College of Rheumatology, European League Against Rheumatism, and Canadian Rheumatology Association were also conducted. Reports from clinical trials of at least 6 months' duration that evaluated abatacept in adults with RA were included in the review. RESULTS: Seven placebo-controlled trials and 1 open- label trial were included in the review, as were the long-term extensions of 5 of the studies and an integrated safety analysis. Abatacept added to methotrexate had an acceptable safety profile in patients with RA who had an inadequate response to methotrexate or other traditional disease-modifying antirheumatic drugs, or who failed to respond to treatment with anti-tumor necrosis factor agents. In the 5 core trials, discontinuations due to adverse events ranged from 1.9% to 8.7% of abatacept recipients and 0.9% to 4.3% of placebo recipients. In the integrated safety analysis, serious infections were reported in 3.0% of abatacept recipients and 1.9% of placebo recipients; the corresponding rates of malignancies were 3.7% and 2.9%. No additional safety concerns emerged during up to 7 years of exposure in the long-term extension studies. Antibodies to abatacept developed in <=3% of patients, with no association found between immunogenicity and adverse events. CONCLUSION: Based on the evidence reviewed, abatacept had an acceptable safety profile and was well tolerated in patients with RA. Copyright © 2010 Excerpta Medica Inc. All rights reserved.",

        "Abstract": "OBJECTIVE: To investigate the long-term effects of the tight control (TC) and conventional (CT) methotrexate-based strategies of the Computer Assisted Management in Early Rheumatoid Arthritis trial in early rheumatoid arthritis and evaluate the predictive value of an early response to treatment. METHODS: Clinical and radiographic 5-year outcome was compared between initial strategies. Patients were classified according to the EULAR response criteria. The prognostic value of early response to treatment in addition to established predictors was analysed by multiple linear regression analyses. RESULTS: 5 years of data were available for 205 of 299 patients, with no indication for selective drop-out. At 5 years there was no longer any significant difference for clinical and radiographic outcomes between treatment strategies applied during the first 2 years. Good-responders had a mean disease activity score of 2.39 (1.2) and median yearly radiographic progression rate of 0.6 (0.0 to 2.2) at 5 years; significantly lower (both p<0.02) when compared to moderate- and non-responders. Multiple regression analysis showed that early response to treatment is an independent predictor of 5-year outcome, irrespective of treatment strategy. CONCLUSIONS: The difference in disease activity between treatment strategies disappeared over the years. Good-response to treatment independently predicts significantly better 5-year clinical and radiographic outcome. The TC principle probably should be continued in the long-term.",

        "Abstract": "OBJECTIVE: To estimate the unit costs of administering intravenous (IV) biological agents in day hospitals (DHs) in the Spanish National Health System. PATIENTS AND METHODS: Data were obtained from 188 patients with rheumatoid arthritis, collected from nine DHs, receiving one of the following IV therapies: infliximab (n=48), rituximab (n=38), abatacept (n=41), or tocilizumab (n=61). The fieldwork was carried out between March 2013 and March 2014. The following three groups of costs were considered: 1) structural costs, 2) material costs, and 3) staff costs. Staff costs were considered a fixed cost and were estimated according to the DH theoretical level of activity, which includes, as well as personal care of each patient, the DH general activities (complete imputation method, CIM). In addition, an alternative calculation was performed, in which the staff costs were considered a variable cost imputed according to the time spent on direct care (partial imputation method, PIM). All costs were expressed in euros for the reference year 2014. RESULTS: The average total cost was 146.12 per infusion (standard deviation [SD] +\/-87.11; CIM) and 29.70 per infusion (SD +\/-11.42; PIM). The structure-related costs per infusion varied between 2.23 and 62.35 per patient and DH; the cost of consumables oscillated between 3.48 and 20.34 per patient and DH. In terms of the care process, the average difference between the shortest and the longest time taken by different hospitals to administer an IV biological therapy was 113 minutes. CONCLUSION: The average total cost of infusion was less than that normally used in models of economic evaluation coming from secondary sources. This cost is even less when the staff costs are imputed according to the PIM. A high degree of variability was observed between different DHs in the cost of the consumables, in the structure-related costs, and in those of the care process.",

        "Abstract": "The aim of this study was to investigate immunohistological changes in mitogen-activated protein kinases (MAPKs) in the synovium following treatment with golimumab, compared with methotrexate (MTX). We assessed synovial tissues for 13 different molecules to detect cytokine levels histologically from 10 methotrexate (MTX)-treated rheumatoid arthritis (RA) patients as controls and 10 golimumab plus MTX-treated RA patients. Synovium samples from both groups were assessed by hematoxylin and eosin (HE) staining and analyzed for expression of tumor necrosis factor-alpha (TNF-alpha), interleukin-6 (IL-6), matrix metalloproteinase-3 (MMP-3), CD4 (T cells), CD8 (T cells), CD20 (B cells), CD68 (macrophages), receptor activator of nuclear (kappa) B ligand (RANKL), bromodeoxyuridine (BrdU), CD29 (beta-1 integrin), phospho-p38 MAPK (Tyr180\/Tyr182), phospho-p44\/42 MAPK (ERK1\/ERK2), and phospho-c-Jun N-terminal kinase (JNK), by an immunohistological examination. HE staining showed that there was a significant decrease in cell proliferation in the synovium in RA patients who received golimumab compared with the controls. TNF-alpha, IL-6, MMP3, BrdU, p38, and ERK were not seen at significant levels in either group. On the other hand, CD4, CD8, CD20, CD29, CD68, RANKL, and JNK were significantly decreased in the golimumab group compared with the control. Based on a histological analysis of the synovium, it appears that the efficacy of the treatment with golimumab may involve the inhibition of cell proliferation, with decreases in T cells, B cells, macrophages, beta-1 integrin, RANKL, and JNK in the synovium, compared with MTX treatment, in RA.",
