                "a": "Downgraded by one level due to serious indirectness. The evidence is based on a population with moderate to high disease activity.",
                "b": "Downgraded by two levels due to very serious imprecision. Confidence interval includes both values suggesting benefit and values suggesting harm.",
                "c": "Downgraded by one level due to serious risk of bias. Lack of blinding of patients, personnel, and outcome assessors.",
                "d": "Downgraded by two levels due to very serious imprecision. Confidence interval includes both values suggesting benefit and values suggesting no effect. Small sample size."
