                "a": "Downgraded by two levels due to very serious risk of bias. Lack of allocation concealment, lack of blinding, and selective reporting.",
                "b": "Downgraded by one level due to serious indirectness. Study compared IA GCs + csDMARD to csDMARDs.",
                "c": "Downgraded by two levels due to very serious imprecision. Confidence interval includes both values suggesting no effect and value suggesting harm. Very small sample size.",
                "d": "Downgraded by one level due to serious imprecision. Very small sample size.",
                "e": "Downgraded by two levels due to very serious imprecision. Very small sample size and low number of events.",
