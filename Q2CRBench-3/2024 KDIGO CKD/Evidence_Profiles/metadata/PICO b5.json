    "Explanations": {
        "a": "There were at least some concerns with the risk of bias for all trials. While it is not possible to blind patients/carers, not all of the trials stated that outcome assessors were blinded (Johnston 2006). Many patients needed to cross-over to the other treatment arm (Hastings 2012, Sedlis 2009), but this information was not always reported in the trials (Johnston 2006). Most of the studies were post hoc analyses of trials (Hastings 2012, Lopes 2009, Sedlis 2009). ",
        "b": "There were only 280 events among the 2243participants enrolled in the 8 trials. The total number of events is lower than the number needed to reach the optimal information size (i.e., 300).",
        "c": "There were at least some concerns with the risk of bias for all trials. Many patients needed to cross-over to the other treatment arm (Hastings 2012, Sedlis 2009). Most of the studies were post hoc analyses of trials (Hastings 2012, Sedlis 2009). ",
        "d": "Not enough information is reported to assess precision. The total number of events is likely to be lower than the number needed to reach the optimal information size (i.e., 300).",
        "e": "Only 2 of the 5 trials reported on this outcome, even though all the trials assessed mortality and cardiovascular events.",
        "f": "CI crosses 1.",
        "g": "We cannot estimate the total number of events that occurred. There were at least 211 events among the 2243 participants enrolled in the 8 trials. The total number of events is lower than the number needed to reach the optimal information size (i.e., 300).",
        "h": "There were only 73 events among the 640 participants enrolled in the 2 trials. The total number of events is lower than the number needed to reach the optimal information size (i.e., 300)."
