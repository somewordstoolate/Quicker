        "Abstract":"['P', 'P']\nBackground In the PAUSE (Perioperative Anticoagulant Use for Surgery Evaluation) Study, a simple, standardized, perioperative interruption strategy was provided for patients with nonvalvular atrial fibrillation taking direct oral anticoagulants (DOACs). Our objective was to define the factors associated with perioperative bleeding. Methods and Results We analyzed bleeding as the composite of major and clinically relevant nonmajor bleeding. Putative predictors of bleeding, and preoperative DOAC level were prospectively collected during recruitment. We used stratified logistic regression models for analysis. All statistical analyses were performed in R version 3.6.0. There were 3007 patients requiring perioperative DOAC interruption. More than one third of the included patients underwent a high bleeding risk procedure. The 30-day rates of major and clinically relevant nonmajor bleeding were 3.02% in apixaban (n=1257), 2.84% in dabigatran (n=668), and 4.16% for rivaroxaban (n=1082). Multivariate analysis stratified by region found more bleeding for hypertension (odds ratio [OR], 1.79; 95% CI 1.07-2.99; =0.027), and prior bleeding (OR, 1.71; 95% CI, 1.08-2.71; =0.021). Surgical bleed risk classification (high- versus low-risk) as a predictor of bleeding was only significant in the univariate analysis. The prediction model for major and clinically relevant nonmajor bleeding had an area under the curve of 0.71, and the preoperative DOAC level did not improve the area under the curve of the model. Conclusions In patients treated with DOACs who required an elective surgery\/procedure and were managed with standardized DOAC interruption and resumption, there we did not find reversible risk factors for bleeding, suggesting that adjustment of the PAUSE management protocol to mitigate against bleeding is not needed.",

        "Abstract":"BACKGROUND: This study aimed to analyze associations between genetic variants and plasma concentrations along with clinical outcomes in dabigatran in patients with non-valvular atrial fibrillation (NVAF).\nMETHODS: We conducted a prospective study and enrolled NVAF patients treated with dabigatran in the real world. A total of 86 patients treated with 110 mg DE twice daily were recruited for this study. Blood samples were obtained from each patient and used for genotyping and determination of plasma dabigatran concentration. All bleeding and thromboembolic complications were recorded during the 1.5 years of follow-up.\nRESULTS: Eighty-three patients provided samples at the trough plasma level of dabigatran, and 58 patients provided samples at the peak plasma level of dabigatran. There was a significant association between the CES1 SNP rs8192935 and trough plasma concentrations of dabigatran (P = 0.013). Our results showed that the CES1 SNP rs8192935 significantly influenced dabigatran trough concentrations in the Chinese population, and carriers of the G allele had increased trough plasma concentrations of dabigatran compared to noncarriers. The ABCB1 SNP c.2482-2236G &gt; A (rs4148738) was associated with major bleeding events in the addictive model (P = 0.046, OR = 3.29) and dominant model (P = 0.040, OR = 8.17). Additionally, the ABCB1 SNP c.3435 C &gt; T (rs1045642) was associated with the incidence of major bleeding events in the addictive model (P = 0.043, OR = 3.34) and dominant model (P = 0.046, OR = 7.77). However, no significant associations were found between all the SNPs and the incidence of minor bleeding events.\nCONCLUSION: Our results indicated that the CES1 polymorphism rs8192935 was associated with trough plasma concentrations of dabigatran. Carriers of the G allele had increased trough plasma concentrations of dabigatran compared to noncarriers. The ABCB1 polymorphisms rs4148738 and rs1045642 were associated with an increased risk for major bleeding events for the first time in a Chinese population.",

        "Abstract":"No studies have performed direct pairwise comparisons of the effectiveness and safety of warfarin and the new oral anticoagulants (NOACs) apixaban, dabigatran, and rivaroxaban. Using 2013 to 2014 claims from a 5% random sample of Medicare beneficiaries, we identified patients newly diagnosed with atrial fibrillation who initiated apixaban, dabigatran, rivaroxaban, warfarin, or no oral anticoagulation therapy in 2013 to 2014. Outcomes included the composite of ischemic stroke, systemic embolism (SE) and death, any bleeding event, gastrointestinal bleeding, intracranial bleeding, and treatment persistence. We constructed Cox proportional hazard models to compare outcomes between each pair of treatment groups. The composite risk of ischemic stroke, SE, and death was lower for NOACs than for warfarin: hazard ratio (HR) 0.86, 95% confidence interval (CI) 0.76 to 0.98 for apixaban; 0.73, 95% CI 0.63 to 0.86 for dabigatran; and 0.82, 95% CI 0.75 to 0.89 for rivaroxaban, all compared with warfarin. There were no differences in effectiveness across NOACs. The risk of any bleeding was lower with apixaban than with warfarin, but higher with rivaroxaban than with warfarin. Apixaban (HR 0.69, 95% CI 0.60 to 0.79) and dabigatran (HR 0.79, 95% CI 0.69 to 0.92) were associated with lower bleeding risk than rivaroxaban. Treatment persistence was highest for apixaban (82%), and lowest for dabigatran and warfarin (64%) (p value <0.001). Compared with warfarin, NOACs are more effective in preventing stroke but their risk of bleeding varies, with rivaroxaban having higher risk than warfarin. Altogether, apixaban had the most favorable effectiveness, safety, and persistence profile.",

        "Abstract":"Venous thromboembolism (VTE), including pulmonary embolism and deep venous thrombosis, either symptomatic or incidental, is a common complication in the history of cancer disease. The risk of VTE is 4-7-fold higher in oncology patients, and it represents the second leading cause of death, after cancer itself. In cancer patients, compared with the general population, VTE therapy is associated with higher rates of recurrent thrombosis and\/or major bleeding. The need for treatment of VTE in patients with cancer is a challenge for the clinician because of the multiplicity of types of cancer, the disease stage and the imbricated cancer treatment. Historically, in cancer patients, low molecular weight heparins have been preferred for treatment of VTE. More recently, in large randomized clinical trials, direct oral anticoagulants (DOACs) demonstrated to reduce the risk of VTE. However, in the \"real life\", uncertainties remain on the use of DOACs, especially for the bleeding risk in patients with gastrointestinal cancers and the potential drug-to-drug interactions with specific anticancer therapies.In cancer patients, atrial fibrillation can arise as a perioperative complication or for the side effect of some chemotherapy agents, as well as a consequence of some associated risk factors, including cancer itself. The current clinical scores for predicting thrombotic events (CHA2DS2-VASc) or for predicting bleeding (HAS-BLED), used to guide antithrombotic therapy in the general population, have not yet been validated in cancer patients. Encouraging data for DOAC prescription in patients with atrial fibrillation and cancer are emerging: recent post-hoc analysis showed safety and efficacy of DOACs for the prevention of embolic events compared to warfarin in cancer patients. Currently, anticoagulant therapy of cancer patients should be individualized with multidisciplinary follow-up and frequent reassessment. This consensus document represents an advanced state of the art on the subject and provides useful notes on clinical practice.",

        "Abstract":"The purpose of the present study was to compare the efficacy and safety of dabigatran and interrupted warfarin with low-molecular-weight heparin bridging in non-valvular atrial fibrillation (AF) catheter ablation. Previously, there has been concerns that bridging therapy increases bleeding events without the benefit of stroke prevention. It has been suggested that bridging therapy should be considered only for patients at high-risk of thrombosis. Nevertheless, bridging therapy in AF patients with a low CHADS2 score may be safe and effective. The authors performed a prospective, observational study that included consecutive 240 patients undergoing AF ablation in P.R. China. A total of 139 patients received 110 mg dabigatran twice daily and 101 patients took dose-adjusted warfarin that had been bridged with low-molecular-weight heparin. The mean patient age was 55.48 years with 72.1% being men and 74.2% having paroxysmal AF. One thromboembolic complication occurred in the dabigatran group compared to none in the warfarin group. Both the groups presented a similar major bleeding rate, total bleeding rate, and bleeding and thromboembolic complications. In patients undergoing AF ablation, the risk of bleeding or thromboembolic complications was similar for both dabigatran and interrupted warfarin with bridging therapy. Bridging therapy appeared to be safe and effective for the low-risk population.",

        "Abstract":"AIMS: Elderly atrial fibrillation (AF) patients with risk factors of bleeding are often considered ineligible for standard oral anticoagulants (OACs). The Edoxaban Low-Dose for EldeR CARE AF patients (ELDERCARE-AF) trial recently showed that edoxaban 15 mg\/day was superior to placebo for preventing stroke or systemic embolism and did not result in a significantly higher incidence of major bleeding. Our aim was to investigate a real-world cohort of AF patients similar to the ELDERCARE-AF cohort, with regard to the impact of direct oral anticoagulant (DOAC) use compared to non-OAC use, in relation to clinical outcomes.\nMETHODS AND RESULTS: From 1 January 2012 to 31 December 2016, 15 183 AF patients aged ≥80 years (mean age 86.63 years [SD 4.79]; 48.7% male) with a congestive heart failure, hypertension, age ≥75 years, diabetes mellitus, and prior stroke or transient ischemic attack (CHADS2) score ≥2 who met the enrolment criteria (generally similar to ELDERCARE-AF) were identified from the Taiwan National Health Insurance Research Database. Patients were categorized into two groups according to their stroke prevention strategies, i.e. without OACs (n = 9084) and DOACs (n = 6099). Patients receiving DOACs were further stratified into reduced-dose- or full-dose-regimen groups. Compared with the non-OAC group as a reference, DOAC use (whether at reduced dose or full dose) was associated with a lower risk of ischaemic stroke (adjusted hazard ratio [aHR] 0.77, 95% confidence interval [CI] 0.67-0.88) and all-cause mortality (aHR 0.39, 95% CI 0.37-0.42), while the risks of intracranial haemorrhage and major bleeding were similar. The risks of composite outcomes of 'ischaemic stroke or mortality' (aHR 0.42, 95% CI 0.40-0.45) and 'ischaemic stroke or major bleeding or mortality' (aHR 0.49, 95% CI 0.46-0.52) were significantly lower with DOAC use. When compared with the non-OAC group as the reference group, DOACs (whether reduced dose or full dose) showed a positive net clinical benefit. The results were generally consistent even after propensity matching.\nCONCLUSION: In routine clinical care, DOACs (whether reduced or full dose) were associated with a lower risk of ischaemic stroke, mortality, and the composite endpoint, when compared with non-OAC use in high-risk elderly AF patients at increased bleeding risk. Our findings provide complementary 'real-world' data to support the generalizability of the results of the ELDERCARE-AF trial to other DOACs in daily clinical practice.",

        "Abstract":"BACKGROUND: Warfarin, a commonly prescribed anticoagulant, requires frequent lab monitoring. Lab monitoring puts patients at risk of COVID-19 exposure and diverts medical resources away from health care systems. Direct oral anticoagulants (DOACs) do not require routine therapeutic monitoring and are indicated first line for nonvalvular atrial fibrillation (NVAF) stroke prevention and venous thromboembolism (VTE) prevention\/treatment.\nOBJECTIVE: The purpose of the study was to determine the proportion of patients who qualify for DOACs and assess for predictors of qualification.\nMETHODS: This cross-sectional study investigated patients on warfarin managed by Michigan Medicine Anticoagulation Service. Direct oral anticoagulant eligibility criteria were established using apixaban, dabigatran, and rivaroxaban package inserts. Patient eligibility was determined through chart review. The primary outcome was the proportion of patients who qualify for DOACs based on clinical factors. Predictors of DOAC qualification were assessed.\nRESULTS: This study included 3205 patients and found 51.8% ( = 1661) of patients qualified for DOACs. Qualifying patients were older (71.9 vs 59.4 years,  < 0.0001) with a higher CHADS VASc (3.7 vs 3.4,  < 0.0007). The primary disqualifying factor was extreme weight, high and low. Accounting for a patient's sex and referral source, age > 65 (odds ratio [OR] = 1.9,  < 0.0001) and NVAF indication (OR = 5.6,  < 0.0001) were significant predictors for DOAC qualification.\nCONCLUSION AND RELEVANCE: Approximately 52% of patients on warfarin were eligible for DOACs. This presents an opportunity to reduce patient exposure to health care settings and health care utilization in the setting of COVID-19. Increased costs of DOACs need to be assessed.",

        "Abstract":"Background We investigated the predictors related to major bleeding events during treatment with edoxaban 15 mg in patients aged ≥80 years with nonvalvular atrial fibrillation and high bleeding risk, for whom standard oral anticoagulants are inappropriate, focusing on standard laboratory tests related to bleeding. Methods and Results This was a prespecified subanalysis of the on-treatment analysis set of the ELDERCARE-AF (Edoxaban Low-Dose for Elder Care Atrial Fibrillation Patients) trial. Major bleeding was the primary safety end point. The event rates were calculated according to prespecified characteristics at baseline. A total of 984 Japanese patients were randomly assigned to edoxaban 15 mg or placebo (n=492, each). During the study period, 20 and 11 major bleeding events occurred in the edoxaban and placebo groups, respectively. The adjusted analysis revealed that hemoglobin <12.3 g\/dL (adjusted hazard ratio [aHR], 3.57 [95% CI, 1.10-11.55]) and prothrombin time ≥12.7 seconds; (aHR, 2.89 [95% CI, 1.05-8.02]) independently predicted major bleeding, while creatinine clearance <30 mL\/min showed a tendency towards an increase in major bleeding (aHR, 2.68; 95% CI, 0.96-7.46). In patients treated with edoxaban lacking these 3 risk factors, no major bleeding occurred; major bleeding event rates increased with each risk factor. Patients with 3 risk factors were significantly more likely to have a major bleeding event at 11.05%\/year (HR, 7.15 [95% CI, 1.92-26.71]). Conclusions In elderly patients with nonvalvular atrial fibrillation with high bleeding risk, baseline hemoglobin <12.3 g\/dL, prothrombin time ≥12.7 seconds, and creatinine clearance <30 mL\/min may predict major bleeding during treatment with edoxaban 15 mg.

The three most common AAMs were warfarin (69 patients), clopidogrel (24), and Factor Xa inhibitors (16). Atrial fibrillation was the most common indication for AAMs (70 patients), venous thrombosis (14) and TIA\/CVA (11). Falls were the most frequent injury mechanism, 79.4%. Soft tissue hematomas (27.4%), TBI (16%), and pelvic fractures (12.3%) were the most common injuries. In 56.6% AAMs were held until follow-up, 31.1% had AAMs resumed at discharge, and AAMs were held indefinitely in 12.3%. Patients discharged to home versus facility (37 vs 18% p<0.05), <75 years of age (47 vs 27% p<0.05) were more likely to have AAMs resumed at discharge. Patients who suffered falls versus MVC mechanism were less likely to have AAMs resumed at discharge (28 vs 82% p<0.05). CHA2DS2-VASc scores were similar between decision groups.\nCONCLUSIONS AND IMPLICATIONS: This is the first description of mandatory communication between trauma and outpatient providers to guide decision making on AAMs after injury. Efforts should be made to determine if this mitigates risk by following patients longterm. This communication should become standard for a population that is often elderly, frail, and at risk of repeat injuries.",

        "Abstract":"OBJECTIVE: To assess the risk of liver injury hospitalisation in patients with atrial fibrillation (AF) after initiation of direct oral anticoagulants (DOACs) or warfarin and to determine predictors of liver injury hospitalisation in this population.\nMETHODS: We studied 113 717 patients (mean age 70, 39% women) with AF included in the MarketScan Commercial and Medicare Supplemental databases with a first prescription for oral anticoagulation after 4 November 2011, followed through 31 December 2014. Of these, 56 879 initiated warfarin, 17 286 initiated dabigatran, 30 347 initiated rivaroxaban and 9205 initiated apixaban. Liver injury hospitalisation and comorbidities were identified from healthcare claims.\nRESULTS: During a median follow-up of 12 months, 960 hospitalisations with liver injury were identified. Rates of liver injury hospitalisation (per 1000 person-years) by oral anticoagulant were 9.0 (warfarin), 4.0 (dabigatran), 6.6 (rivaroxaban) and 5.6 (apixaban). After multivariable adjustment, liver injury hospitalisation rates were lower in initiators of DOACs compared with warfarin: HR (95% CI) of 0.57 (0.46 to 0.71), 0.88 (0.75 to 1.03) and 0.70 (0.50 to 0.97) for initiators of dabigatran, rivaroxaban, and apixaban, respectively (vs. warfarin). Compared with dabigatran initiators, rivaroxaban initiators had a 56% increased risk of liver injury hospitalisation (HR 1.56, 95% CI 1.22 to 1.99). In addition to type of anticoagulant, prior liver, gallbladder and kidney disease, cancer, anaemia, heart failure and alcoholism significantly predicted liver injury hospitalisation. A predictive model including these variables had adequate discriminative ability (C-statistic 0.67, 95% CI 0.64 to 0.70).\nCONCLUSIONS: Among patients with non-valvular AF, DOACs were associated with lower risk of liver injury hospitalisation compared with warfarin, with dabigatran showing the lowest risk.",

        "Abstract":"BACKGROUND: Direct oral anticoagulants (DOAC) are hydrophilic drugs with plasma levels inversely proportional to lean body mass. Sarcopenic patients with low muscle mass may be at risk for supra-therapeutic DOAC levels and bleeding complications. We therefore sought to examine the influence of lean body mass on DOAC levels in older adults with atrial fibrillation (AF).\nMETHODS: A prospective cohort study was conducted with patients 65 years of age or more receiving rivaroxaban or apixaban for AF. Appendicular lean mass (ALM) was measured using a bioimpedance device and a dual X-ray absorptiometry scanner. DOAC levels were measured using a standardized anti-Xa assay 4 hours after (peak) and 1 hour before (trough) ingestion.\nRESULTS: The cohort consisted of 62 patients (47% female, 77.0 ± 6.1 years). The prescribed DOACs were apixaban 2.5 mg (21%), apixaban 5 mg (53%), and rivaroxaban 20 mg (26%). Overall, 16% had supra-therapeutic DOAC levels at trough and 25% at peak. In the multivariable logistic regression model, lower ALM was independently associated with supra-therapeutic DOAC levels at trough (odds ratio per ↓ 1-kg 1.23, 95% confidence interval 1.02 to 1.49) and peak (odds ratio per ↓ 1-kg 1.18, 95% confidence interval 1.02 to 1.37). Addition of ALM to a model consisting of age, total body weight, and renal function resulted in improved discrimination for supra-therapeutic DOAC levels.\nCONCLUSION: Our proof-of-concept study has identified an association between ALM and DOAC levels in older adults with AF. Further research is needed to determine the impact of ALM on bleeding complications and the potential role of ALM-guided dosing for sarcopenic patients.",

        "Abstract":"BACKGROUND: Direct oral anticoagulant (DOAC) dose is adjusted according to manufacturer's recommendations when introduced. However, subsequent changes from appropriate DOAC doses to \"unintended\" inappropriate low-dose DOAC (ILD) due to increased body weight (BW) or decreased serum creatinine concentration might be overlooked. We investigated outcomes in patients receiving appropriate DOAC, \"intended\" ILD, or unintended ILD, to determine the optimal review time for DOAC doses and associated factors.\nMETHODS: This single-center, retrospective cohort study included inpatients receiving apixaban for stroke prevention between August 2015 and July 2017. Primary outcome was whether starting DOAC dose was selected according to manufacturer's recommendations and whether that dose remained appropriate thereafter. Secondary outcome was the incidence of recurrent ischemic stroke and intracranial bleeding during therapy. Average rates of change in BW, creatinine, and creatinine clearance (CrCl) were evaluated after hospitalization every 10 ± 3 days.\nRESULTS: During the study period, 120 patients received apixaban; 112 (93.3%) commenced appropriate DOAC doses, and 8 (6.7%) commenced intended ILD doses. Of the 112 patients on appropriate DOAC doses, 7 (6.3%) changed to unintended ILD doses because of increased BW (n = 4) or decreased creatinine (n = 3). The rate of recurrent ischemic stroke differed significantly between the appropriate DOAC dose and the intended or unintended ILD dose group (1.9% [2 of 105] versus 20.0% [3 of 15], P = .014). BW and renal function had stabilized after 20 ± 3 days posthospitalization.\nCONCLUSIONS: Receiving ILD doses, especially unintended, might be a risk factor for recurrent ischemic stroke and DOAC dose should be reviewed around 20 ± 3 days posthospitalization.",

        "Abstract":"['2', '2', '2', '2']\n['2', '2']\nAnticoagulation is highly effective for the prevention of stroke in patients with atrial fibrillation (AF) but it is dependent on patients continuing therapy. While studies have demonstrated suboptimal therapeutic persistence on warfarin, few have studied persistence rates with non vitamin K antagonist oral anticoagulants (NOACs) such as dabigatran. We examined rates of continued use of dabigatran versus warfarin over 1 year among AF patients in the ORBIT-AF registry between June 29, 2010 and August 09, 2011. Multivariable logistic regression analysis was used to identify characteristics associated with 1-year persistent use of dabigatran therapy or warfarin. At baseline, 6.4 and 93.6% of 7150 AF patients were on dabigatran and warfarin, respectively. At 12 months, dabigatran-treated patients were less likely to have continued their therapy than warfarin-treated patients [Adjusted persistence rates: 66% (95% CI 60-72) vs. 82% (95% CI 80-84), p < .0001]. Predictors of dabigatran persistence included: CHADS-VASc risk scores ≥ 2 OR 5.69, (95% CI 1.50-21.6) and BMI greater than 25 mg\/m but less than 38 kg\/m 1.05 (1.01-1.09). Predictors of persistence on warfarin included: African American race (vs. White) 1.53 (1.07-2.19), Hispanic ethnicity (vs. White) 1.66 (1.06-2.60), paroxysmal and persistent AF (vs. new-onset) 1.68 (1.21-2.33) and 1.91 (1.35-2.69) respectively, LVH 1.40 (1.08-1.81), and CHADS-VASc risk scores ≥ 2 1.94 (1.18-3.19). While 1-year persistence rates for dabigatran were lower than warfarin, persistence rates for both agents were not ideal. Future studies evaluating contemporary persistence are needed in order to assist in better targeting interventions aimed to improve anticoagulation persistence.",

Patients were randomized to either rivaroxaban (2.5 mg bid) or placebo. New-onset AF was confirmed by the investigator at study visits.\nRESULTS: 241 (4.8%) patients developed AF during the follow-up (median 21 months). Older age (≥ 65 years), LVEF < 35%, history of PCI or CABG, White race, SBP < 110 mmHg, and higher BMI (≥ 25 kg\/m) were independently associated with risk of new-onset AF, whereas the use of DAPT was associated with a lower risk of new-onset AF. We then built a risk score from these variables (with good accuracy C-index = 0.71) and calibration across observed and predicted tertiles of risk. New-onset AF events rates increased steeply by increasing tertiles of the risk-score. Compared to tertile 1, the risk of new-onset AF was 2.5-fold higher in tertile 2, and 6.3-fold higher in tertile 3. Rivaroxaban had no effect in reducing new-onset AF.

We also compared warfarin users with non-users in a case-crossover study.\nMETHODS: We utilized a cohort design that drew eligible patients from the Truven Health MarketScan Commercial database, the Optum Clinformatics Data Mart, and Medicare. Within each database, we compared the 6-month relative rate of angioedema among new users of NOACs (dabigatran, rivaroxaban, apixaban) and new users of warfarin. We estimated hazard ratios (HRs) and 95% confidence intervals (CIs) after adjusting for confounders using propensity score stratification, and meta-analyzed the database-specific HRs using a random-effects model. We also estimated an odds ratio (OR) for the association between warfarin and angioedema using a case-crossover design, a self-controlled design that controls for time-invariant confounders.\nRESULTS: In the cohort study, we observed 249 incident angioedema events among 267,681 NOAC initiators and 281,143 warfarin initiators across all databases. The meta-analyzed HR for angioedema comparing any NOAC versus warfarin was 0.98 (95% CI 0.76-1.27). In the case-crossover design, the OR for the association between warfarin and angioedema was 0.91 (95% CI 0.68-1.21) based on 431 cases.\nCONCLUSIONS: Our estimates were inconsistent with substantial short-term relative increases in the rate of angioedema associated with oral anticoagulant therapy.",

        "Abstract":"['2', '2', '2', '2']\nAnticoagulation with direct-acting oral anticoagulants (DOACs) is recommended over warfarin for stroke prevention in patients with atrial fibrillation (AF). The efficacy of DOACs over warfarin in obese patients with AF is less defined and may carry the potential for subtherapeutic anticoagulation and reduced efficacy. The best available evidence to guide DOAC use in obese patients with AF is from analysis of obese subgroups of all the major landmark DOAC trials. From these subgroup analyses of the RE-LY, ARISTOTLE, ENGAGE-AF TIMI 48, and ROCKET-AF trials, DOAC use in obese patients demonstrated efficacy similar or superior to warfarin for stroke reduction. Major bleeding rates were similar or higher with DOACs compared with warfarin in these obese subgroup analyses. Meta-analysis of the above major clinical trials concluded that DOACs were more effective compared with warfarin for stroke prevention in obese patients (up to a body mass index [BMI] of 50 kg\/m) and had lower incidence of major bleeding. The totality of evidence supports that DOACs are as effective, if not superior, to warfarin in obese patients with AF. We propose an algorithm, based on the available evidence and current guidelines, to guide the use of DOACs based on severity of obesity. Any DOAC can be used in obese patients with BMI < 40 kg\/m. In patients with a BMI of 40-50 kg\/m, warfarin should be used, but apixaban or edoxaban can be considered. In obese patients with a BMI > 50 kg\/m, warfarin should be used.",

The Hospital Frailty Risk Score was used to define frailty and the CHADS-VASc and CHADS-65 scores were used to identify if anticoagulation was indicated.\nRESULTS: Among 75,796 patients (median age, 75 years; 45% female) with a new diagnosis of NVAF, 17,143 (22.6%) were frail. Although guideline criteria for anticoagulation were more commonly met by frail patients than nonfrail patients (92.1% vs 74.2%, for CHADS-VASc, and 96.8% vs 85.8% for CHADS-65; both P < 0.0001), frail patients were less likely to receive any anticoagulant, even after those with contraindications to anticoagulation were excluded (adjusted odds ratio, 0.61; 95% confidence interval, 0.58-0.64). After DOACs became available, anticoagulant prescribing for patients with guideline indications increased more in nonfrail patients (from 42.4% to 68.2%) than in frail patients (from 29.0% to 52.2%) and frail patients were less likely to receive a DOAC than warfarin (adjusted odds ratio, 0.66; 95% confidence interval, 0.54-0.81).\nCONCLUSIONS: Although they stand to potentially derive greater benefits from anticoagulation, frail patients were less likely to receive an anticoagulant and, if anticoagulated, they were more likely to receive warfarin than a DOAC.

        "Abstract":"BACKGROUND\/AIMS: Dabigatran, an oral direct thrombin inhibitor, is used in patients with non-valvular atrial fibrillation to reduce thromboembolic events. Whereas the 150 mg dosing regimen has been extensively studied in clinical setting, to date, there is no clinical data on the 75 mg (low dose, \"LD\") regimen. In this study, we evaluated patient characteristics and clinical outcomes in 49 patients treated with LD dabigatran.\nMETHODS: Electronic medical records were utilized to compare patients from one medical center treated with LD dabigatran to those from the warfarin arm of the RE-LY trial.\nRESULTS: Compared to those from the warfarin arm of the RE-LY trial, the LD dabigatran patients were significantly older (82.6 vs. 71.6 years,  < 0.001), had higher prevalence of diabetes (42.9 vs. 23%,  < 0.001), were predominantly male (100 vs. 63.3%,  < 0.001), and had higher CHADS2 score (2.8 vs. 2.1,  < 0.001). Only 9 (18%) patients had creatinine clearance of <30 ml\/min and none were on concomitant medications that required dose adjustment to LD dabigatran. During a mean follow up of 10.1 months, there were no thromboembolic events, no cerebrovascular events, and seven bleeding events in the LD dabigatran group of which only two required blood transfusion.\nCONCLUSION: In this database, most patients received LD dabigatran based on characteristics not related to the approved indications for this dose. The exploratory clinical outcomes of using LD dabigatran outside of the current approved indications are promising in this high-risk population and deserve further investigation to better understand the role of LD dabigatran in clinical practice.",

        "Abstract":"INTRODUCTION: Some patients with atrial fibrillation (AF) develop left atrial appendage thrombus (LAAT) despite receiving anticoagulant treatment. Different scores were proposed to evaluate thromboembolic risk in patients with AF. Risk stratification according to sex is common in clinical practice.\nOBJECTIVE: We aimed to identify predictors of LAAT separately in men and women treated with dabigatran or rivaroxaban.\nPATIENTS AND METHODS: This retrospective study included 1256 patients (479 women [38.1%]) with AF who underwent transesophageal echocardiography before electrical cardioversion or catheter ablation, between January 2013 and December 2019, and received dabigatran or rivaroxaban for at least 3 weeks.\nRESULTS: Multivariable logistic regression analysis revealed nonparoxysmal AF to predict LAAT in women (odds ratio [OR], 9.70; P = 0.002). In men, the predictors were heart failure (OR, 4.14; P = 0.001), diabetes (OR, 2.64; P = 0.002), nonparoxysmal AF (OR, 5.61; P = 0.02), and estimated glomerular filtration rate below 60 ml\/min\/1.73 m2 (OR, 2.77; P = 0.01). In the receiver operating characteristic curve analysis, the CHA2DS2‑VASc-RAF score had the highest value for predicting LAAT in women (area under the curve [AUC] = 0.786). In men, CHA2DS2‑VASc-RAF, CHA2DS2, CHA2DS2‑VASc, and R2CHADS2 had sufficient predictive value (AUC = 0.786, 0.726, 0.734, and 0.780, respectively).\nCONCLUSIONS: The predictors of LAAT differ between men and women treated with dabigatran or rivaroxaban.

        "Abstract":"BACKGROUND: Optimal antithrombotic treatment after transcatheter aortic valve replacement (TAVR) is unknown and determined empirically. The direct factor Xa inhibitor rivaroxaban may potentially reduce TAVR-related thrombotic complications and premature valve failure.\nDESIGN: GALILEO is an international, randomized, open-label, event-driven, phase III trial in more than 1,520 patients without an indication for oral anticoagulation who underwent a successful TAVR (ClinicalTrials.govNCT02556203). Patients are randomized (1:1 ratio), 1 to 7days after a successful TAVR, to either a rivaroxaban-based strategy or an antiplatelet-based strategy. In the experimental arm, subjects receive rivaroxaban (10mg once daily [OD]) plus acetylsalicylic acid (ASA, 75-100mg OD) for 90days followed by rivaroxaban alone. In the control arm, subjects receive clopidogrel (75mg OD) plus ASA (as above) for 90days followed by ASA alone. In case new-onset atrial fibrillation occurs after randomization, full oral anticoagulation will be implemented with maintenance of the original treatment assignment. The primary efficacy end point is the composite of all-cause death, stroke, myocardial infarction, symptomatic valve thrombosis, pulmonary embolism, deep venous thrombosis, and systemic embolism. The primary safety end point is the composite of life-threatening, disabling, and major bleeding, according to the Valve Academic Research Consortium definitions.\nCONCLUSIONS: GALILEO will test the hypothesis that a rivaroxaban-based antithrombotic strategy reduces the risk of thromboembolic complications post-TAVR with an acceptable risk of bleeding compared with the currently recommended antiplatelet therapy-based strategy in subjects without need of chronic oral anticoagulation.",

There is a need to compare low-dose DOACs with warfarin or other DOACs on effectiveness and safety.  Using administrative data from Quebec province, Canada, we built a cohort of new warfarin or DOAC users discharged from hospital between 2011 and 2017. We determined CHADS-VASc and HAS-BLED scores, and comorbidities for 3-year prior cohort entry. The primary effectiveness endpoint was a composite of ischemic stroke\/systemic embolism (SE), and secondary outcomes included a safety composite of major bleeding (MB) events and effectiveness composite (stroke\/SE, death) at 1-year follow-up. We contrasted each low-dose DOAC with warfarin or other DOACs as references using inverse probability of treatment weighting to estimate marginal Cox hazard ratios (HRs).  The cohort comprised 22,969 patients (mean age: 80-86). We did not find a significant risk reduction for the stroke\/SE primary effectiveness endpoint for DOACs vs. warfarin; however, we observed a significantly lower risk for low-dose dabigatran vs. warfarin (HR [95%CI]: 0.59 [0.42-0.81]) for effectiveness composite, mainly due to a lower death rate. The differences in effectiveness and safety composites between low-dose rivaroxaban vs. warfarin were not significant. However, low-dose apixaban had a better safety composite (HR: 0.68 [0.53-0.88]) vs. warfarin. Comparisons of dabigatran vs. apixaban showed a lower risk of stroke\/SE (HR: 0.53 [0.30-0.93]) and a 2-fold higher risk of MB. The MB risk was higher for rivaroxaban than for apixaban (HR: 1.58 [1.09-2.29]).  The results of this population-based study suggest that low-dose dabigatran has a better effective composite than warfarin. Compared with apixaban, low-dose dabigatran had a better effectiveness composite but a worse safety profile. Low-dose apixaban had a better safety composite than warfarin and other low-dose DOACs. Given that the comparative effectiveness and safety seem to vary from one DOAC to another, pharmacokinetic data for specific populations are now warranted.",

A primary endpoint of MACCE and a co-primary endpoint of major bleeding by ISTH criteria were considered at 12 months.\nRESULTS: A total of 1249 patients (81.1 ± 4.2 years, 33.1% women, 66.6% ACS, 30.6% complex PCI) were included. Triple antithrombotic therapy (TAT) was prescribed in 81.7% and dual antithrombotic therapy (DAT) in 18.3%. TAT was based on direct oral anticoagulants (DOAC) in 48.4% and maintained for only 1 month in 52.2%, and DAT included DOAC in 70.6%. Primary endpoint of MACCE was met in 9.6% and primary endpoint of major bleeding in 9.4%.

Brain magnetic resonance imaging using fluid-attenuated inversion recovery and high-resolution diffusion-weighted imaging was obtained within 3 to 48 hours after AF ablation in all eligible patients enrolled in 25 study centers in Europe and the United States. Patients underwent cognitive assessment 3 to 6 weeks before ablation and 3 months after ablation using the Montreal Cognitive Assessment (MoCA).\nRESULTS: In 84 (26.1%) of 321 patients with analyzable magnetic resonance imaging, high-resolution diffusion-weighted imaging detected at least 1 acute brain lesion, including 44 (27.2%) patients treated with apixaban and 40 (24.8%) patients treated with vitamin K antagonist (=0.675). Median MoCA score was similar in patients with or without acute brain lesions at 3 months after ablation (28 [interquartile range (IQR), 26-29] versus 28 [IQR, 26-29]; =0.948).

During long-term anticoagulant therapy, delayed or missed doses are common. This study aimed to explore appropriate remedial dosing regimens for non-adherent rivaroxaban-treated patients.\nMETHODS: Monte Carlo simulation based on a previously established rivaroxaban population pharmacokinetic\/pharmacodynamic (PK\/PD) model for patients with NVAF was employed to design remedial dosing regimens. The proposed regimens were compared with remedial strategies in the European Heart Rhythm Association (EHRA) guide by assessing deviation time in terms of drug concentration, factor Xa activity, and prothrombin time.\nRESULTS: The proposed remedial dosing regimens were dependent on delay duration. The missed dose should be taken immediately when the delay does not exceed 6 h; a half dose is advisable when the delay is between 6 and 20 h. A missed dose should be skipped if less than 4 h remains before the next dose.

Adherence to NOAC therapy has been unsatisfactory and decreases over time. Remedial strategies are currently used to address the non-adherence events. Current recommendations, however, are generic and not well supported by evidence. The aim of this study was to explore appropriate remedial dosing regimens for non-adherent edoxaban-treated NVAF patients through Monte Carlo simulation.\nMETHODS: Six regimens were compared with the current recommendations of the European Heart Rhythm Association (EHRA) guide based on total deviation time. Both edoxaban plasma concentration and intrinsic Factor Xa activity were considered. Monte Carlo simulations were performed using RxODE based on a published population pharmacokinetic\/pharmacodynamic (PK\/PD) model.\nRESULTS: The proposed remedial strategies were different than the EHRA recommendations and were related to the delay time. However, it was found that the missed dose can be administered immediately if the delay time is within 11 h. When the delay is between 12 and 19 h, a half dose followed by a regular dosing schedule is recommended. When the delay time exceeds 19 h, a full dose followed by a half dose is preferred.\nCONCLUSION: PK\/PD modelling and simulation are effective in developing and evaluating the remedial strategies of edoxaban, which can help maximise its therapeutic effect.",

        "Abstract":"BACKGROUND: Direct oral anticoagulants (DOAC) including edoxaban are increasingly used for stroke prevention in atrial fibrillation. Despite treatment, annual stroke rate in these patients remains 1-2%. Rapid assessment of coagulation would be useful to guide thrombolysis or reversal therapy in this growing population of DOAC\/edoxaban-treated stroke patients. Employing the Hemochron™ Signature Elite point-of-care test system (HC-POCT), clinically relevant plasma concentrations of dabigatran and rivaroxaban can be excluded in a blood sample. However, no data exists on the effect of edoxaban on HC-POCT results. We evaluated whether edoxaban plasma concentrations above the current treatment thresholds for thrombolysis or anticoagulation reversal (i.e., 30 and 50 ng\/mL) can be ruled out with the HC-POCT.\nMETHODS: We prospectively studied patients receiving a first dose of edoxaban. Six blood samples were collected from each patient: before, 0.5, 1, 2, 8, and 24 h after drug intake. HC-POCT-based INR (HC-INR), activated clotting time (HC-ACT+ and HC-ACT-LR), activated partial thromboplastin time (HC-aPTT), and mass spectrometry for edoxaban plasma concentrations were performed at each time-point. We calculated correlations, receiver operating characteristics (ROC) and test-specific cut-offs for ruling out edoxaban concentrations > 30 and > 50 ng\/mL in a blood sample.\nRESULTS: One hundred twenty blood samples from 20 edoxaban-treated patients were analyzed. Edoxaban plasma concentrations ranged from 0 to 512 ng\/mL. HC-INR\/HC-ACT+\/HC-ACT-LR\/HC-aPTT ranged from 0.7-8.3\/78-310 s\/65-215 s\/19-93 s, and Pearson's correlation coefficients showed moderate to very strong correlations with edoxaban concentrations (r = 0.95\/0.79\/0.70\/0.60). With areas under the ROC curve of 0.997 (95% confidence interval: 0.991-0.971) and 0.989 (0.975-1.000), HC-INR most reliably ruled out edoxaban concentrations > 30 and > 50 ng\/mL, respectively, and HC-INR results ≤1.5 and ≤ 2.1 provided specificity\/sensitivity of 98.6% (91.2-99.9)\/98.0% (88.0-99.9) and 96.8% (88.0-99.4)\/96.5% (86.8-99.4).\nCONCLUSIONS: Our study represents the first systematic evaluation of the HC-POCT in edoxaban-treated patients. Applying sufficiently low assay-specific cut-offs, the HC-POCT may not only be used to reliably rule out dabigatran and rivaroxaban, but also very low edoxaban concentrations in a blood sample. Because the assay-specific cut-offs were retrospectively defined, further investigation is warranted.\nTRIAL REGISTRATION: ClinicalTrials.gov, registration number: NCT02825394 , registered on: 07\/07\/2016, URL.",

        "Abstract":"OBJECTIVE: To compare effectiveness and safety of warfarin and the direct oral anticoagulants (DOAC) dabigatran, rivaroxaban and apixaban in non-valvular atrial fibrillation in routine care.\nMETHODS: From nationwide registries, we identified treatment-naïve patients initiating warfarin, dabigatran, rivaroxaban or apixaban for non-valvular atrial fibrillation from July 2013 to December 2015 in Norway. We assessed prescription duration using reverse waiting time distribution. Adjusting for confounding in a Cox proportional hazards model, we estimated one-year risks for ischemic stroke, transient ischemic attack (TIA) or systemic embolism, major or clinically relevant non-major bleeding; intracranial; gastrointestinal; and other bleeding. We censored at switch of treatment or 365 days of follow-up.\nRESULTS: We included 30,820 treatment-naïve patients. Compared to warfarin, the adjusted hazard ratios (HR) for ischemic stroke, TIA or systemic embolism were 0.96 (95% CI 0.71-1.28) for dabigatran, 1.12 (95% CI 0.87-1.45) for rivaroxaban and 0.97 (95% CI 0.75-1.26) for apixaban. Corresponding hazard ratios for major or clinically relevant non-major bleeding were 0.73 (95% CI 0.62-0.86) for dabigatran, 0.97 (95% CI 0.84-1.12) for rivaroxaban and 0.71 (95% CI 0.62-0.82) for apixaban. Statistically significant differences of other safety outcomes compared to warfarin were fewer intracranial bleedings with dabigatran (HR 0.28, 95% CI 0.14-0.56), rivaroxaban (HR 0.40, 95% CI 0.23-0.69) and apixaban (HR 0.56, 95% CI 0.34-0.92); fewer gastrointestinal bleedings with apixaban (HR 0.70, 95% CI 0.52-0.93); and fewer other bleedings with dabigatran (HR 0.67, 95% CI 0.55-0.81) and apixaban (HR 0.70, 95% CI 0.59-0.83).\nCONCLUSION: After 1 year follow-up in treatment-naïve patients initiating oral anticoagulation for non-valvular atrial fibrillation, all DOACs were similarly effective as warfarin in prevention of ischemic stroke, TIA or systemic embolism. Safety from bleedings was similar or better, including fewer intracranial bleedings with all direct oral anticoagulants, fewer gastrointestinal bleedings with apixaban and fewer other bleedings with dabigatran and apixaban.",

Our objectives were to evaluate peak and trough dabigatran plasma concentrations over time in a geriatric population and to identify factors associated with dabigatran plasma concentrations and to assess the relationship with bleeding events.\nMETHODS: Peak and trough dabigatran plasma concentration were performed 4,8,15,30,45 days after inception of dabigatran treatment in 68 consecutive patients ≥75 years old hospitalized in a geriatric hospital with atrial fibrillation. Bleeding events were monitored for 1 year.\nRESULTS: Mean age was 85.8(5.1) years old and 76.5% were women. Overall, 541 dabigatran plasma measurements (270 peak, 271 trough) were performed. Mean dabigatran concentrations of the 5 sequential measurements ranged 106-146ng\/mL for peak and 66-84ng\/mL for trough. Renal failure was associated with high peak and trough dabigatran concentration. Inter- and intra-individual coefficients of variation were 59.5% and 44.7% for peak and 74.5% and 44.6% for trough. Participants in the lower two tertiles of dabigatran concentration at day 8 (D8) remained below the 90th percentile (243.9ng\/ml) on the next measurements. Bleeding events were associated with high trough dabigatran concentrations. Trough dabigatran concentration at D8>243.9ng\/mL significantly predicted bleeding.\nCONCLUSION: In this geriatric population, renal function and low albumin were associated with dabigatran concentrations.

Propensity scores with standardized mortality ratio weighting were used to control for confounding. We used weighted Cox proportional hazards models to estimate separately the hazard ratios (HRs) with 95% confidence intervals (CIs) of ischemic stroke, major bleeding, and major adverse limb events associated with the use of apixaban compared with rivaroxaban. We also evaluated whether the risk was modified by age, sex, duration of diabetes, microvascular and macrovascular complications of diabetes, nephropathy, CHADS-VASc and HAS-BLED scores, and by dose (standard vs. low dose).\nRESULTS: The cohort included 11,561 apixaban and 8,265 rivaroxaban users.

        "Abstract":"UNLABELLED: Essentials Reversal of anticoagulant effects of dabigatran may occur despite application of idarucizumab. Monitoring of dabigatran level after antidote application is crucial to detect rebound. Repeated doses of idarucizumab may be necessary in cases of massive dabigatran accumulation. Combination of antidote application and renal replacement therapy may offer additional benefit.\nSUMMARY: Idarucizumab is a monoclonal antibody fragment designed for reversing the anticoagulant effects of dabigatran. Administration is recommended as two intravenous boluses of 2.5 g within 15 min of each other or as a single 5 g bolus. However, in certain situations a second dose of the drug could be necessary. We report the case of a 77-year-old man, treated with dabigatran for paroxysmal atrial fibrillation. He presented at our department with acute renal failure, concomitant massive dabigatran accumulation and subsequent acute gastrointestinal bleeding. Fifty minutes after the administration of idarucizumab, the dabigatran plasma concentration decreased from a peak of 1630 ng ml to a level below the detection limit of 30 ng ml and bleeding stopped. Eight hours after administration, the dabigatran plasma level started to increase up to 1560 ng ml (96% of the maximum value obtained), accompanied by a further drop in hemoglobin. Concomitant hemodialysis and hemofiltration led to a continuous decrease in dabigatran plasma levels. However, sepsis and multiorgan failure ensued, which led to death. With this case report we raise the question of whether massive dabigatran accumulation requires repeated doses of idarucizumab, or alternatively, if the combination of antidote with hemodialysis\/renal replacement therapy is advisable in order to remove circulating levels of dabigatran.",

        "Abstract":"BACKGROUND: Both warfarin and nonvitamin K antagonist oral anticoagulants (NOACs) are increasingly used for thromboembolic prevention in patients with nonvalvular atrial fibrillation (NVAF). However, there are limited data concerning anticoagulation for left atrial (LA) thrombus or sludge. We aimed to determine the efficacy of warfarin and NOACs in LA thrombus or sludge in patients with NVAF or atrial flutter (AFL).\nMATERIALS AND METHODS: Seventy-two patients with LA thrombus or sludge were analyzed who were scheduled for catheter ablation of NVAF or AFL between December 2015 and November 2018. Baseline demographics, the nature and duration of anticoagulation therapy and LA thrombus or sludge resolution were recorded.\nRESULTS: After receiving anticoagulation therapy for 101.5 (76.3-151) days, 44 patients (61.1%) demonstrated LA thrombus or sludge resolution, including 10 (58.8%) for warfarin, 15 (57.7%) for dabigatran and 19 (65.5%) for rivaroxaban (with no significant differences among these anticoagulants). After either prolonged anticoagulation, increased dosage or a change in anticoagulant, 14 patients underwent a third transesophageal echocardiography after 194.5 days (164.8-401.0) and an additional nine patients (12.5%) demonstrated LA thrombus or sludge resolution. Finally, 53 patients (73.6%) demonstrated complete resolution of LA thrombus or sludge, and this group had a lower CHADS-VASc score (P = 0.044) and a lower rate of stroke history (P = 0.041).\nCONCLUSIONS: Compared with warfarin, dabigatran and rivaroxaban can also effectively resolve LA thrombus or sludge with no significant differences. Increasing the duration of anticoagulation, determining the optimal dosage of anticoagulants, and switching to another anticoagulant when necessary could be considered to improve treatment effectiveness.",

Patients with NVAF (aged≥18 years) with anticoagulant treatment started in the preceding 3 months were evaluated in four groups (NOAC [apixaban, dabigatran or rivaroxaban] or vitamin K antagonist [VKA]).\nRESULTS: Data from 2027 patients were eligible for analysis. Mean age was 73.0±11.2 years, 56.6% were men and 80.2% were anticoagulant naïve. Stage≥4 chronic kidney disease was present in 2.2% of patients prescribed apixaban, none of those prescribed dabigatran or rivaroxaban, and 16.8% of those prescribed VKAs. The median CHADS-VASc score was 3 for all three NOACs and 4 for VKAs; the median HAS-BLED score was≥3 for 2.5-5.9% of patients prescribed NOACs and 12.0% of those prescribed VKAs. Apixaban was more likely to be prescribed than other NOACs in older patients with higher bleeding risk and decreased renal function, and VKAs in patients with lower bleeding risk and better renal function. Patients received a reduced dose (5mg\/day; 30.4% patients) or a full dose (10mg\/day; 69.6% patients) of apixaban. Only 79.3% of patients prescribed apixaban had doses consistent with the summary of product characteristics; underdosing was more frequent than overdosing. Off-label use of apixaban was observed, mainly in elderly patients, despite normal renal function and weight.\nCONCLUSIONS: Initiation of apixaban versus NOACs was more common among patients with increased age, higher bleeding risk and decreased renal function, whereas initiation of apixaban versus VKAs was more common among patients with lower bleeding risk and better renal function.",

        "Abstract":"INTRODUCTION: Anticoagulants are effective for stroke prevention in atrial fibrillation (AF). Data on population health-related cardiovascular outcomes by race\/ethnicity and gender are not well described. The aim was to assess the impact of patient diversity on associated cardiovascular outcomes related to warfarin anticoagulation in Medicare beneficiaries with AF.\nMETHODS: Medicare administrative claims data for years 2000-2010 were used to calculate AF prevalence and rates of new AF cases. Three 20% sample cohorts of new AF beneficiaries for years 2000, 2005, and 2007 were extracted and analyzed in a longitudinal study design. The impact of warfarin on associated cardiovascular outcomes was measured with respect to race\/ethnicity and gender. Measured outcomes included the risk of stroke, mortality and hospitalization after adjusting for age, gender, race\/ethnicity, CHADS2 score and warfarin.\nRESULTS: AF prevalence and warfarin use increased while stroke and mortality rates declined across race\/ethnicity and gender from 2000 to 2010. Analyses comparing Whites to non-Whites highlighted several disparities: (1) Blacks were 40% (p < 0.0001) more likely to have a stroke even after adjustment for warfarin; (2) in 2007, Hispanics had a 35% (p < 0.01) higher prevalence of stroke and warfarin did not reduce the risk; and (3) Asians had better outcomes. Warfarin reduced stroke less well in women who had a lower risk of death and hospitalization. Despite a > 70% (p < 0.0001) reduction in mortality for warfarin users, Blacks had a 25% (p < 0.0001) higher mortality risk than Whites.\nCONCLUSIONS: Differences in population health metrics across race\/ethnicity and gender exist in AF. Across all metrics, Blacks had comparatively worse outcomes. Patient diversity should be a focus for future investigations in AF to improve outcomes in the whole population.\nFUNDING: National Minority Quality Forum.",

        "Abstract":"3\nBackground The aims of the present study were to investigate the relationships between prior direct oral anticoagulant ( DOAC ) therapy and infarct volume and the site of arterial occlusion in patients with acute ischemic stroke and non-valvular atrial fibrillation. Methods and Results From March 2011 through November 2016, consecutive patients with acute ischemic stroke in the middle cerebral artery territory and non-valvular atrial fibrillation were recruited. The infarct volume was assessed semi-automatically using initial diffusion-weighted imaging, and the arterial occlusion site was evaluated on magnetic resonance angiography. The effect of prior DOAC treatment on the site of arterial occlusion was assessed by multivariate ordinal logistic regression analysis. A total of 330 patients (149 women; median age 79 [quartiles 71-86] years; median National Institutes of Health Stroke Scale score 11 [4-21]) were enrolled. Of these, 239 were on no anticoagulant, 40 were undertreated with a vitamin K antagonist ( VKA ), 22 were sufficiently treated with VKA ( PT - INR ≥1.6), and 29 were on a DOAC before the acute ischemic stroke. The infarct volume on admission differed among the groups (median 14.5 [2.0-59.8] cm in patients with no anticoagulation, 24.8 [2.1-63.0] in undertreated VKA , 1.3 [0.3-13.5] in sufficient VKA , and 2.3 [0.5-21.0] in DOAC , P=0.001). Multivariate analysis showed that prior DOAC treatment was independently and negatively associated with more proximal artery occlusion (odds ratio [OR] 0.34, P=0.015), compared with no anticoagulant. Conclusions DOAC treatment before the event was associated with smaller infarct volume and decreased risk of greater proximal artery occlusion in acute ischemic stroke patients with non-valvular atrial fibrillation, compared with no anticoagulation.",

We evaluated the effectiveness and associated risk of DOACs vs warfarin, as well as comparisons of DOACs, in a large population of cancer patients with nonvalvular atrial fibrillation (AF). Using the MarketScan databases, we identified 16 096 AF patients (mean age, 74 years) initiating oral anticoagulant and being actively treated for cancer between 2010 and 2014. Anticoagulant users were matched by age, sex, enrollment date, and drug initiation date. Study end points were identified with diagnostic codes and included ischemic stroke, severe bleeding, other bleeding, and venous thromboembolism (VTE). Cox regression was used to estimate associations of anticoagulants with study end points. Compared with warfarin, rates of bleeding (hazard ratio [95% confidence interval]) were similar in rivaroxaban (1.09 [0.79, 1.39]) and dabigatran (0.96 [0.72, 1.27]) users, whereas apixaban users experienced lower rates (0.37 [0.17, 0.79]). Rates of ischemic stroke did not differ among anticoagulant users. Compared with warfarin, rate of VTE (hazard ratio [95% confidence interval]) was lower among rivaroxaban (0.51 [0.41, 0.63]), dabigatran (0.28 [0.21, 0.38]), and apixaban (0.14 [0.07, 0.32]) users. In head-to-head comparisons among DOACs, dabigatran users had lower rates of VTE than rivaroxaban users; apixaban users had lower rates of VTE and severe bleeding than rivaroxaban users. In this population of patients with AF and cancer, DOAC users experienced lower or similar rates of bleeding and stroke compared with warfarin users, and a lower rate of incident VTE.",

        "Abstract":"Rivaroxaban, a direct factor Xa inhibitor, is widely used for stroke prevention in patients with non-valvular atrial fibrillation (NVAF). The aim of this study was to conduct a population pharmacokinetic-pharmacodynamic (PK-PD) analysis of rivaroxaban in Chinese patients with NVAF to assess ethnic differences and provide model-based precision dosing. A total of 256 rivaroxaban plasma concentrations and 244 prothrombin time (PT) measurements were obtained from 195 Chinese NVAF patients from a prospective clinical trial. The population PK-PD model was developed using nonlinear mixed effects modeling (NONMEM) software. The PK of rivaroxaban was adequately described using a one-compartment model with first-order adsorption and elimination. Estimated glomerular filtration rate (eGFR) was identified as a major covariate for apparent clearance. No single nucleotide polymorphism was identified as a significant covariate. PT exhibited a linear relationship with rivaroxaban concentration. Total bilirubin (TBIL) and eGFR were identified as significant covariates for baseline PT. According to the Monte Carlo simulation, 15 mg for Chinese patients with eGFR ≥50 mL\/min and normal liver function yielded an exposure comparable to 20 mg for Caucasian patients. Patients with moderately impaired renal function may require a lower dose of rivaroxaban to avoid overexposure. Moreover, there was an approximate 26% increase in PT levels in patients with TBIL of 34 μmol\/L and eGFR of 30 mL\/min, which could increase the risk of major bleeding. The established population PK-PD model could inform individualized dosing for Chinese NVAF patients who are administered rivaroxaban.",

        "Abstract":"BACKGROUND: Direct oral anticoagulants (DOACs) are currently recommended as first-line or (after vitamin K antagonists) second-line therapy for preventing stroke and systemic embolism in patients with non-valvular atrial fibrillation. In patients aged 80 years and over, however, the fear of DOAC-associated bleeding and the complexity of DOAC dosing regimes may prompt physicians to prescribe inappropriate dose levels.\nOBJECTIVE: The objective of this study was to determine compliance with French and European guidelines of doses of three DOACs (apixaban, dabigatran and rivaroxaban) prescribed to patients aged over 80 years in an indication of non-valvular atrial fibrillation, and to identify factors associated with poor compliance.\nMETHODS: We performed a retrospective single-centre study of patients aged over 80 years routinely treated with a DOAC (apixaban, dabigatran or rivaroxaban) for non-valvular atrial fibrillation at Valenciennes General Hospital (Valenciennes, France) between 1 January, 2016 and 31 December, 2017. We determined compliance with French and European guidelines of DOAC doses as a function of each patient's clinical and laboratory parameters, and thus classified the regime as being appropriately dosed, overdosed or underdosed.\nRESULTS: A total of 703 patients (371 taking apixaban, 92 taking dabigatran and 240 taking rivaroxaban) were included in the study. We found that 274 patients (39%) had been prescribed an inappropriate DOAC regime, with underdosing in 241 cases (34%) and overdosing in 33 cases (5%). Underdosing mainly concerned the two most widely prescribed DOACs, i.e. apixaban (39% of all apixaban prescriptions were underdosed) and rivaroxaban (40%). Concomitant treatment with an antidepressant was associated with underdosing of rivaroxaban or apixaban (p = 0.0339). In contrast, initial management in a neurology department was associated with appropriate dosing (p = 0.000146) for both these DOACs.\nCONCLUSIONS: Among patients with non-valvular atrial fibrillation aged 80 years and over, about 40% of DOAC prescriptions feature inappropriate dose levels. It might be possible to reduce inappropriate dosing by raising awareness among hospital-based and private-practice prescribers, providing prescription support tools for DOACs, and performing medication reconciliations and reviews at hospital and in private practice.",

Using US Department of Defense (DOD) data, this study compared the risk of stroke\/SE and major bleeding for DOACs relative to warfarin.\nMETHODS: Adult patients with ≥1 pharmacy claim for apixaban, dabigatran, rivaroxaban, or warfarin from 01 Jan 2013-30 Sep 2015 were selected. Patients were required to have ≥1 medical claim for atrial fibrillation during the 12-month baseline period. Patients with a warfarin or DOAC claim during the 12-month baseline period were excluded. Each DOAC cohort was matched to the warfarin cohort using propensity score matching (PSM). Cox proportional hazards models were conducted to evaluate the risk of stroke\/SE and major bleeding of each DOAC vs warfarin.\nRESULTS: Of 41,001 identified patients, there were 3691 dabigatran-warfarin, 8226 rivaroxaban-warfarin, and 7607 apixaban-warfarin matched patient pairs. Apixaban was the only DOAC found to be associated with a significantly lower risk of stroke\/SE (hazard ratio [HR]: 0.55; 95% confidence interval [CI]: 0.39, 0.77; p < 0.001) and major bleeding (HR: 0.65; 95% CI: 0.53, 0.80; p < 0.001) compared to warfarin.

We investigated the proportions and features of major GI bleeding (MGIB) events related to occult GI cancers in patients receiving anticoagulation therapy.\nMETHODS: We analyzed data from the Randomized Evaluation of Long Term Anticoagulant Therapy study (conducted between December 2005 and March 2009 in 951 clinical centers in 44 countries worldwide), which compared the abilities of dabigatran vs warfarin to prevent stroke and systemic embolism in 18,113 patients with atrial fibrillation. Two blinded gastroenterologists independently reviewed source documents of MGIB events (n = 595) that occurred during the study period. We collected data on MGIB events caused by previously unidentified GI malignancies, and compared characteristics of MGIB events in patients who received dabigatran vs warfarin (primary end point), and in patients with bleeding from cancer, vs patients bleeding from a nonmalignant or unidentified source.\nRESULTS: Of 546 unique MGIB events, 44 (8.1%) were found to be from GI cancers (34 of 398 MGIB events in dabigatran users and 10 of 148 MGIB events in warfarin users; P = .60). Colorectal cancer accounted for 35 of 44 of all cancers identified. There were more colorectal cancer-associated MGIB events in the dabigatran group (30 of 34) than in the warfarin group (5 of 10) (P = .02), but more gastric cancer-associated MGIB events in the warfarin group (5 of 10) than in the dabigatran group (1 of 34) (P = .001). There were no differences in the short-term outcomes of cancer-related MGIB events in the dabigatran vs the warfarin group, but 75% of all cancer-related MGIB events required at least 1 blood transfusion and the mean hospital stay was 10.1 days. Compared with MGIB events from a nonmalignant or unidentified source, MGIB from cancer occurred sooner (343.0 vs 223.1 d; P = .003), but the bleeding was more likely to be chronic (for >7 d) (27.3% vs 63.6%; P < .001).\nCONCLUSIONS: In evaluating data from a study of the effects of anticoagulation therapy, we found approximately 1 of every 12 MGIB events to be related to an occult cancer.

Asians have higher risks of bleeding complications when taking anticoagulants. However, evidence that considers laboratory parameters is lacking. Objective We aimed to compare the safety and effectiveness between direct oral anticoagulants and warfarin in Asian patients with nonvalvular atrial fibrillation. Setting Retrospective design using hospital-based data. Method This propensity score-matched cohort study included data extracted from the electronic medical records of the En Chu Kong Hospital Research Database. Main outcome measure Outcome measures were major bleeding and thromboembolism. Cox proportional hazard models were applied for evaluating hazard ratios with 95% confidence intervals. Results Among 1075 patients with nonvalvular atrial fibrillation, 687 and 388 were administered direct oral anticoagulants and warfarin, respectively. After propensity score matching, 264 patient pairs were selected. Compared with warfarin use, direct oral anticoagulant use was associated with similar risks for major bleeding and thromboembolism; however, the latter was associated with increased gastrointestinal bleeding risks (adjusted hazard ratio 3.59; 95% confidence interval, 1.31-11.39). Notably, an approximately 10 fold increased risk of gastrointestinal bleeding was observed in 0-6 month direct oral anticoagulant users (adjusted hazard ratio 10.13, 95% confidence interval 1.27-80.89).

        "Abstract":"BACKGROUND: While guidelines recommend anticoagulation for all atrial fibrillation (AF) patients ≥75 years, evidence for the net clinical benefit (NCB) of anticoagulant in older adults is sparse. We sought to determine the association between age and NCB of anticoagulation in older adults with AF.\nMETHODS AND RESULTS: We examined adults ≥75 years with incident AF in the Anticoagulation and Risk Factors in Atrial Fibrillation-Cardiovascular Research Network cohort. Using a Markov state transition model, we estimated the lifetime NCB of warfarin and apixaban relative to no treatment in quality-adjusted life years (QALYs). In the decision model, each month patients face a chance of stroke, hemorrhage, or death from a competing cause; the likelihood of each is a function of individual patients' stroke risk, hemorrhage risk, and life expectancy. We defined minimal clinically relevant lifetime benefit as 0.10 QALYs. In a sensitivity analysis, we examined the effect of competing risks of death on NCB using 2 models, one including competing risks and the second without competing risks. We included 14 946 patients, with a median age of 81 years and median CHADS-VASc score of 4. In the main analysis, after age 87, NCB associated with warfarin decreased below 0.10 lifetime QALYs while NCB associated with apixaban did not decrease below 0.10 lifetime QALYs until after age 92. In sensitivity analyses, over a 3-year horizon, removing competing risks of death resulted in higher NCB (at 90 years, median difference using warfarin 0.010 QALYs [95% CI, 0.009-0.013], median difference using apixaban 0.025 QALYs [95% CI, 0.024-0.026]).\nCONCLUSIONS: The NCB of anticoagulation decreases with advancing age. The competing risk of death diminishes the NCB of anticoagulation for older patients with AF. Physicians should consider competing mortality risks when recommending anticoagulants to older adults with AF.",

Baseline characteristics were balanced between the two cohorts with a mean (standard deviation [SD]) age of 71 (12) years and a mean (SD) CHADS-VASc score of 3.2 (1.7). Apixaban initiators had a significantly lower risk of stroke\/SE (HR: 0.67, 95 % CI: 0.59-0.76) and major bleeding (HR: 0.60, 95 % CI: 0.54-0.65) than warfarin initiators. Different types of stroke\/SE and major bleeding - including ischaemic stroke, haemorrhagic stroke, SE, intracranial haemorrhage, gastrointestinal bleeding, and other major bleeding - were all significantly lower for apixaban compared to warfarin treatment. Subgroup analyses (apixaban dosage, age strata, CHADS-VASc or HAS-BLED score strata, or dataset source) all show consistently lower risks of stroke\/SE and major bleeding associated with apixaban as compared to warfarin treatment. This is the largest \"real-world\" study on apixaban effectiveness and safety to date, showing that apixaban initiation was associated with significant risk reductions in stroke\/SE and major bleeding compared to warfarin initiation after PSM. These benefits were consistent across various high-risk subgroups and both the standard- and low-dose apixaban dose regimens.",

        "Abstract":"PURPOSE: Compliance with anticoagulation treatment for atrial fibrillation is highly variable. Smartphone electrocardiograms that allow patients to have greater insight into their arrhythmia burden may improve anticoagulant compliance.\nMETHODS: Patients were enrolled if they had atrial fibrillation with a CHADS-VASc score of 2 or more, were eligible for anticoagulation and had a smartphone. Participants were randomly assigned to receive a smartphone electrocardiogram (AliveCor Kardia) to record their electrocardiograms 5 times\/week or to the control group. All patients received 6 months of anticoagulant (apixaban) dispensed as 1-month pre-loaded pill boxes.\nRESULTS: A total of 100 patients were enrolled from July 2017 to August 2019, but 5 patients in the monitor arm and 1 in the control arm withdrew prematurely. The monitor and control groups did not differ in age, gender, CHADS-VASc score, or comorbidities. Median medication compliance was 99.7%, with nonsignificantly greater compliance in the monitor group (100%) than in the control group (99.7%) (p-value = 0.247). There was also no significant difference between missing any dose and use\/nonuse of the smartphone monitor (48.9% vs. 55.1%; p-value = 0.692). Mean monitor compliance was 86.8% ± 14.0% with an average of 4.34 recorded electrocardiograms per week. Monitor group patients with perfect medication compliance had significantly higher monitor compliance than those patients who missed doses (median 95.3% vs 86.7%; p-value = 0.02).\nCONCLUSIONS: In a study population with higher-than-expected medication compliance, the use of smartphone electrocardiogram did not demonstrate an improvement in medication compliance as compared to usual care. Greater monitor compliance was associated with greater medication compliance.\nCLINICAL TRIAL REGISTRATION: BOAT-OAR ClinicalTrials.gov number, NCT03515083.",

        "Abstract":"OBJECTIVE: Critically ill patients admitted to the intensive care unit (ICU) often develop atrial fibrillation (AF), with an incidence of around 5%. Stroke prevention in AF is well described in clinical guidelines. The extent to which stroke prevention is prescribed to ICU patients with AF is unknown. We aimed to determine the incidence of new-onset AF and describe stroke prevention strategies initiated on the ICU of our teaching hospital. Also, we compared mortality in patients with new-onset AF to critically ill patients with previously diagnosed AF and patients without any AF.\nMETHODS: This study was a retrospective cohort study including all admissions to the ICU of the Martini Hospital (Groningen, The Netherlands) in the period 2011 to 2016. Survival analyses were performed using these real-world data.\nRESULTS: In total, 3334 patients were admitted to the ICU, of whom 213 patients (6.4%) developed new-onset AF. 583 patients (17.5%) had a previous AF diagnosis, the other patients were in sinus rhythm. In-hospital mortality and 1-year mortality after hospital discharge were significantly higher for new-onset AF patients compared with patients with no history of AF or previously diagnosed AF. At hospital discharge, only 56.3% of the new-onset AF-patients eligible for stroke prevention received an anticoagulant. Anticoagulation was not dependent on CHADS-VASc score or other patient characteristics. An effect of anticoagulative status on mortality was not significant.\nCONCLUSION: AF is associated with increased mortality in critically ill patients admitted to the ICU. More guidance is needed to optimise anticoagulant treatment in critically ill new-onset AF patients.",

        "Abstract":"INTRODUCTION: Inappropriate use of oral anticoagulants (OACs) have not been well investigatedand, however, may be frequent in real-world practice in patients with nonvalvular atrial fibrillation (NVAF). This study was designed to evaluate the prescription patterns and appropriateness of OACs in patients with NVAF in real-world clinical settings.\nMETHODS: We performed a prospective, observational study (NCT02366338). A total of 148 patients with NVAF were screened for OAC prescription. Appropriateness of prescribing was evaluated using 9 criteria of the Medication Appropriateness Index (MAI): indication, choice, dosage, modalities and practicability of administration, drug-drug interactions, drug-disease interactions, duplication, and duration. For each criterion, the evaluator has to rate whether the medication is (A) appropriate, (B) inappropriate but with limited clinical importance, and (C) inappropriate.\nRESULTS: Of 148 patients, 73 (50%) were on warfarin (group 1), 39 (26%) were on rivaroxaban (group 2), and 36 (24%) were on dabigatran therapy (group 3). The MAI showed that 83% of group 1, 28% of group 2, and 47% of group 3 patients had at least 1 inappropriate criterion. Moreover, according to the choice criterion, 37% of group 1, 8% of group 2 and 5% of group 3 were rated as inappropriate, and dosage was not appropriate in 77% of group 1, 23% of group 2, and 42% of group 3.\nCONCLUSION: Inappropriate drug use is frequent among patients with NVAF not only for warfarin but also for NOACs. Although there is an apparent improvement in thromboprophylaxis of NVAF, much more effort is needed for appropriate use of OACs.",

        "Abstract":"IMPORTANCE: The randomized clinical trials comparing nonvitamin K antagonist oral anticoagulants (NOACs) vs warfarin largely focused on recruiting high-risk patients with atrial fibrillation with more than 2 stroke risk factors, with only the trials testing dabigatran or apixaban including few patients with 1 stroke risk factor. Despite this, regulatory approvals of all NOACs have been based on stroke prevention for patients with atrial fibrillation with 1 or more stroke risk factors.\nOBJECTIVE: To compare the effectiveness and safety study of standard-dose NOACs (dabigatran at 150 mg twice daily, rivaroxaban at 20 mg once daily, and apixaban at 5 mg twice daily) and warfarin in patients with atrial fibrillation with 1 low-risk, nonsex-related stroke risk factor.\nDESIGN, SETTING, AND PARTICIPANTS: This nationwide observational cohort study used data from Danish registries to determine the inverse probability of treatment-weighted comparative effectiveness and safety of standard-dose NOACs (dabigatran at 150 mg twice daily, rivaroxaban at 20 mg once daily, and apixaban at 5 mg twice daily) compared with treatment with warfarin among 14 020 patients with atrial fibrillation with 1 low-risk, nonsex- related stroke risk factor.\nMAIN OUTCOMES AND MEASURES: Rates of ischemic stroke\/systemic embolism, death, and bleeding.\nRESULTS: Of 14 020 participants, 5151 (36.7%) were women, and the median age for participants was 66.5 years. For the principal effectiveness end point of ischemic stroke\/systemic embolism, no significant differences of the NOACs compared with treatment with warfarin across strata were evident. For the end point of \"any bleeding,\" this was significantly lower for treatment with apixaban (hazard ratio [HR], 0.35; 95% CI, 0.17-0.72) and dabigatran (HR, 0.48; 95% CI, 0.30-0.77) compared with warfarin in the main analysis, and was not significantly different for treatment with rivaroxaban vs warfarin (HR, 0.84; 95% CI, 0.49-1.44). There was broad consistency across most subgroups in the sensitivity analyses and whether 1- or 2.5-year follow-up periods were analyzed. However, falsification end points generally did not falsify, indicating the possible presence of residual confounding across these comparisons, presumably related to selective prescribing and unobserved covariates.\nCONCLUSIONS AND RELEVANCE: In this Danish cohort study of patients with atrial fibrillation and a single stroke risk factor, there was no difference between NOACs compared with treatment with warfarin in terms of the risk of having an ischemic stroke\/systemic embolism. For \"any bleeding,\" this was lower for treatment with apixaban and dabigatran compared with warfarin. These data do not allow for a definitive statement of the comparative effectiveness or safety of NOACs because of the possible residual confounding that was unmasked with falsification outcomes.",

        "Abstract":"PURPOSE: The goal of this study was to compare the relative efficacy and safety of different types of interventions for stroke prevention in patients with cardiovascular and cerebrovascular diseases.\nMETHODS: This network meta-analysis (NMA) was conducted with a random effects model of Bayesian framework using Stata version 12.0. Odds ratios (ORs) and their credible intervals (CrIs) were applied for the efficacy and safety evaluation of various medical interventions, including aspirin, dipyridamole, ticlopidine, warfarin, and apixaban. In addition, the ranking of probability of every clinical outcome was estimated by comparing the surface under the cumulative ranking curve.\nFINDINGS: Compared with dabigatran, both edoxaban and aspirin + warfarin exhibited a higher rate of all-cause stroke (OR, 2.84 [95% CrI, 1.17-6.97]; OR, 3.42 [95% CrI, 1.20-9.84]). With respect to intracranial hemorrhage, aspirin + clopidogrel yielded worse outcomes than 7 treatments, including placebo, apixaban, aspirin, aspirin + dipyridamole, cilostazol, clopidogrel, and dabigatran (OR, 2.21 [95% CrI, 1.45-3.40]; OR, 2.11 [95% CrI, 1.05-4.17]; OR, 1.53 [95% CrI, 1.11-2.15]; OR, 1.78 [95% CrI, 1.01-3.03]; OR, 4.17 [95% CrI, 1.37-14.28]; OR, 1.85 [95% CrI, 1.22-2.86]; and OR, 2.56 [95% CrI, 1.37-4.76]). In terms of ischemic stroke, dabigatran provided better efficacy than placebo, aspirin, and aspirin + dipyridamole (OR, 0.36 [95% CrI, 0.18-0.72]; OR, 0.43 [95% CrI, 0.21-0.84]; and OR, 0.41 [95% CrI, 0.17-0.94]). As for mortality, dabigatran resulted in a lower mortality compared with aspirin, aspirin + clopidogrel, edoxaban, and warfarin (OR, 0.48 [95% CrI, 0.23-0.97]; OR, 0.40 [95% CrI, 0.17-0.92]; OR, 0.27 [95% CrI, 0.10-0.72]; and OR, 0.52 [95% CrI, 0.28-0.92]).\nIMPLICATIONS: There are still some limitations to our NMA research. For instance, the lack of direct evidence for some therapies resulted in inconsistencies, particularly for warfarin compared with placebo and clopidogrel under different end points. Moreover, the included randomized controlled trials for patients with cardiovascular and cerebrovascular diseases are relatively broad, involving atrial fibrillation, myocardial infarction, and large-artery atherosclerosis stroke. Although further research is needed, dabigatran is highly recommended based on the present NAM for the treatment of cardiovascular and cerebrovascular diseases due to the drug's efficacy and safety.",

        "Abstract":"BACKGROUND: There is inadequate information on the risk of gastrointestinal (GI) bleeding in patients who are under rivaroxaban and warfarin therapy in Iran. Determining the risk of GI bleeding in patients receiving these two drugs can help to select a more appropriate anti-coagulation prophylaxis in high-risk patients.\nOBJECTIVE: The aim of this study was to compare the incidence of GI bleeding in patients with atrial fibrillation (AF) and concomitant bleeding risk factors receiving either warfarin or rivaroxaban.\nMETHODS: In this observational study, 200 patients with AF and bleeding risk factors who referred to Imam Hossein Hospital (Tehran, Iran) were included. The patients were under treatment with either warfarin or rivaroxaban. The incidence of GI bleeding was compared between the two groups monthly for one year.\nRESULTS: GI bleedings were observed in 61% and 34% of patients treated with warfarin and rivaroxaban, respectively (P = 0.001).Melena was the most common type of GI bleeding in both groups. History of hypertension, history of stroke, consumption of anti-platelet drugs, NSAID consumption, and history of alcohol consumption were associated with more frequent GI bleeding only in warfarin group.\nCONCLUSION: The incidence of GI bleeding was lower in AF patients who received rivaroxaban compared to those treated with warfarin. Also, GI bleeding risk does not change according to the consumption of other anti-coagulant drugs and underlying history of hypertension or stroke in patients received rivaroxaban. Therefore, rivaroxaban is suggested as the choice of prophylaxisin patients with AF and concomitant coagulopathy.",

Patients receiving a VKA 4 weeks prior to the initial XANTUS study visit and switched to rivaroxaban were asked to complete the Anti-Clot Treatment Scale (ACTS). Changes from the initial visit to the first follow-up visit at ∼ 3 months (corresponding to a comparison of rivaroxaban vs prior VKA) for ACTS burden and benefit scores were calculated using and reported as least squared mean differences (LSMDs) with 95% confidence intervals (CIs).\nRESULTS: The study included 1291 NVAF patients with prior VKA treatment. The mean baseline ACTS burden and benefit scores were 50.51 ± 8.42 and 10.30 ± 2.70, respectively.

We estimated marginal hazard ratios with 95% CIs for the association of each direct-acting oral anticoagulant, compared with warfarin, for the outcomes of interest using inverse-probability-of-treatment weighted Cox proportional hazards models in as-treated and intention-to-treat analyses.\nRESULTS: A total of 22 739 individuals met criteria (46.3% warfarin, 29.6% apixaban, 17.2% rivaroxaban, 6.9% dabigatran).

        "Abstract":"BACKGROUND AND PURPOSE: Reversing the effect of dabigatran among patients with atrial fibrillation is important to normalize coagulation profile among patients who develop serious hemorrhage from any source. However, such intervention always has the potential to cause a prothrombotic state. Among patients suspected of ischemic stroke, Idarucizumab, may be administered preceding thrombolysis. This is a considerable option when given during the critical phase of revascularization.\nMETHODS: We report the case of an 84-year old, male, banker, known hypertensive with chronic renal disease. He has non valvular atrial fibrillation receiving Dabigatran at 75 mg twice daily and presented with symptoms of right-sided weakness, right hemisensory loss, facial asymmetry, and slurring of speech equating to National Institute of Health Stroke Scale (NIHSS) of 5. After coming into the hospital for a suspected stroke, 3 hours and 25 minutes after symptoms, complete reversal of Dabigatran with Idarucizumab was administered and intravenous thrombolysis was initiated 271 minutes post ictus. There was immediate improvement of the right upper extremity weakness and dysarthria 30 minutes post infusion. At 13 days post ictus, the patient was discharged with minimal right central facial palsy and right arm drift (NIHSS 2). Brain CT scan post revascularization did not reveal any hemorrhage and anticoagulant Apixaban 2.5 mg twice daily was started and maintained thereafter. Brain Magnetic Resonance Angiogram (MRA) showed complete recanalization of the left proximal MCA after 52 days.\nCONCLUSION: Our case showed the effectiveness and safety of giving Idarucizumab followed by thrombolysis in Dabigatran-treated atrial fibrillation with ischemic stroke. Based on this case, the procedure can be performed in an elderly population with chronic kidney disease when administered close to the limit of threshold for thrombolysis.",

        "Abstract":"['CysC', 'CysC+Creatinine', 'CysC', 'CysC', 'CysC', 'CysC+Creatinine']\nBackground We compared different methods of estimated glomerular filtration rate (eGFR) and their association with cardiovascular death and major bleeding in 14 980 patients with atrial fibrillation in the ARISTOTLE (Apixaban for Reduction in Stroke and Other Thromboembolic Events in Atrial Fibrillation) trial. Methods and Results eGFR was calculated using equations based on creatinine (Cockcroft-Gault, Modification of Diet in Renal Disease, and Chronic Kidney Disease Epidemiology Collaboration [CKD-EPI]) and\/or cystatin C (CKD-EPI and CKD-EPI). These 5 eGFR equations, as well as the individual variables that are used in these equations, were assessed for correlation and discriminatory ability for cardiovascular death and major bleeding. The median age was 70.0 years, and 35.6% were women. The median eGFR was highest with Cockcroft-Gault (74.1 mL\/min) and CKD-EPI (74.2 mL\/min), and lowest with Modification of Diet in Renal Disease (66.5 mL\/min). Correlation between methods ranged from 0.49 (Cockroft-Gault and CKD-EPI) to 0.99 (Modification of Diet in Renal Disease and CKD-EPI). Among the eGFR equations, those based on cystatin C yielded the highest C indices for cardiovascular death and major bleeding: 0.628 (CKD-EPI) and 0.612 (CKD-EPI), respectively. A model based on the variables within the different eGFR equations (age, sex, weight, creatinine, and cystatin C) yielded the highest discriminatory value for both outcomes, with a C index of 0.673 and 0.656, respectively. Conclusions In patients with atrial fibrillation on anticoagulation, correlation between eGFR calculated using different methods varied substantially. Cystatin C-based eGFRs seem to provide the most robust information for predicting death and bleeding. A model based on the individual variables within the eGFR equations, however, provided the highest discriminatory value. Our findings may help refine risk stratification in patients with atrial fibrillation and define how renal function should be determined in future atrial fibrillation studies.

        "Abstract":"PURPOSE: To assess the predicted rate and the factors associated with bleeding events among patients with non-valvular atrial fibrillation (NVAF) receiving dabigatran therapy.\nMETHODS: This retrospective cohort study includes adult patients of two tertiary hospitals in Malaysia. Potential study subjects were identified using pharmacy supply database or novel oral anticoagulant (NOAC) registry. Demographics, clinical data and laboratory test results were extracted from the medical records of the patients or electronic databases. The main outcome measure is the occurrence of a bleeding event. Bleeding events were classified into major bleeding, clinically relevant non-major bleeding, or minor bleeding, according to the International Society on Thrombosis and Haemostasis criteria. We consider clinically relevant non-major bleeding events or major bleeding events as clinically relevant bleeding events. An occurrence of any bleeding event was recorded from the initiation of NOAC therapy until the death of a patient, or the date of permanent discontinuation of NOAC use, or the last day of data collection. The predicted rate of dabigatran-induced bleeding events per 100 patient-years was estimated.\nRESULTS: During a median follow-up period of 18 months, 73 patients experienced 90 bleeding events. Among these patients, 25 including 4 fatal cases, experienced major bleeding events. The predicted rate per 100 patient-years of follow-up of any bleeding events was 9.0 [95% CI 6.9 to 11.1]; clinically relevant bleeding events 6.0 [95% CI 4.8 to 8.3], and major bleeding events 3.0 [95% CI 1.9 to 4.2]. The independent risk factor for clinically relevant bleeding events is prior bleeding. While prior bleeding or congestive heart failure is linked with major bleeding events.\nCONCLUSIONS: The predicted rate for dabigatran-induced major bleeding episodes is low but these adverse events carry a high fatality risk. Preventive measures should target older patients who have prior bleeding or congestive heart failure. This article is open to POST-PUBLICATION REVIEW.

There is an issue with safety, especially in clinically relevant bleeding. We performed a network meta-analysis to evaluate the risk of major gastrointestinal (GI) bleeding associated with NOACs.\nMETHODS: Interventions were warfarin, enoxaparin, apixaban, dabigatran, edoxaban, and rivaroxaban. The primary outcome was the incidence of major GI bleeding. A subgroup analysis was performed according to the following indications: AF, deep venous thrombosis\/pulmonary embolism, and postsurgical prophylaxis.\nRESULTS: A total of 29 randomized controlled trials (RCTs) and 4 large observation population studies were included. Compared with warfarin, apixaban showed a decreased the risk of major GI bleeding (relative risk [RR] 0.54, 95% confidence interval [CI] 0.25-0.76), and rivaroxaban tended to increase this risk (RR 1.40, 95% CI 1.06-1.85). Dabigatran (RR 1.25, 95% CI 0.98-1.60), edoxaban (RR 1.07, 95% CI 0.69-1.65), and enoxaparin (RR 1.24, 95% CI 0.63-2.43) did not significantly increase the risk of GI bleeding than did warfarin. In the subgroup analysis, according to indications, apixaban showed a decreased risk of major GI bleeding (RR 0.50, 95% CI 0.34-0.74) than did warfarin in AF studies. Dabigatran (RR 2.36, 95% CI 1.55-3.60, and rivaroxaban (RR 1.75, 95% CI 1.10-6.41) increased the risk of major GI bleeding than did apixaban. An analysis of studies on venous thromboembolism or pulmonary embolism showed that no individual NOAC or enoxaparin was associated with an increased risk of major GI bleeding compared to warfarin.\nCONCLUSION: Individual NOACs had varying profiles of GI bleeding risk.

The present study brings together the opinions and daily routine clinical practices of physicians regarding the use of NOACs in the geriatric age group for the treatment of venous thromboembolic diseases.\nMATERIALS AND METHODS: The study accessed 274 physicians (197 attending, 70 resident and seven primary care physicians) with various specialties and academic positions through face-to-face interviews or e-mails, and asked them to complete a questionnaire form prepared for NOAC use on a voluntary basis between 1 May and 31 December 2019.\nRESULT: It was found that physicians preferred NOACs mostly for patients contraindicated for the regular use of low-molecular-weight heparins and warfarin (n: 264, 96%), and with an unbalanced INR level (n: 230, 87%). The use of NOACs was found to be higher in the geriatric age group than other anticoagulants due to the easy dose adjustment, the extended monitoring intervals and the low risk of bleeding. Among the physicians, neither the specialty nor a higher number of occupational working years affected the preference for NOACs or other anticoagulants.\nCONCLUSIONS: Our study has demonstrated that physicians consider NOACs to be a good treatment option in terms of efficacy and reliability for the treatment of thromboembolic diseases in the geriatric age group, who may have treatment compliance difficulties. It was found also that they plan treatment considering the benefit-to-harm ratio and the bleeding-ischemic event balance.",

We sought to define the proportion of patients with AF qualifying for and receiving OAC in contemporary practice by applying the CHADS-VASc score to patients with a low CHADS score.\nMETHODS AND RESULTS: Among patients with AF enrolled in the American College of Cardiology National Cardiovascular Data Registry's outpatient Practice Innovation and Clinical Excellence registry (2008-2014) CHADS score of 0 or 1, we calculated the impact of adoption of the CHADS-VASc score on the proportion of patients with an indication for OAC. We examined trends in prescription of OAC overall, direct OAC (dabigatran\/rivaroxaban\/apixaban), and multivariable associations between clinical characteristics and OAC use. Of 346 068 patients with AF aged 65±12 years, 61% were men and 65% were white. In total, 24% of those with CHADS=0 and 81% of those with a CHADS=1 were reclassified as having a definite indication for OAC (CHADS-VASc score ≥2). OAC use increased from 37% to 48% during the study period, and direct OAC use increased from 5% to 30%. Increasing CHADS-VASc score (odds ratio, 2.07; 95% confidence interval, 1.97-2.19 for score of 4 versus 0) and rhythm control strategy (odds ratio, 1.34; 95% confidence interval, 1.30-1.39) were associated with increased OAC use.\nCONCLUSIONS: Adoption of the CHADS-VASc score reclassifies 64.5% of patients with AF with low CHADS scores into a class I indication for OAC prescription. Overall OAC prescription increased between 2011 and 2014.",

        "Abstract":"There are limited data regarding direct oral anticoagulants (DOACs) for stroke prevention in patients with bioprosthetic heart valves (BHVs) and atrial fibrillation (AF). The objectives of this study were to evaluate the ambulatory utilization of DOACs and to compare the effectiveness and safety of DOACs versus warfarin in patients with AF and BHVs. We conducted a retrospective cohort study at a large integrated health care delivery system in California. Patients with BHVs and AF treated with warfarin, dabigatran, rivaroxaban, or apixaban between September 12, 2011 and June 18, 2020 were identified. Inverse probability of treatment-weighted comparative effectiveness and safety of DOACs compared with warfarin were determined. Use of DOACs gradually increased since 2011, with a significant upward in trend after a stay-at-home order related to COVID-19. Among 2,672 adults with BHVs and AF who met the inclusion criteria, 439 were exposed to a DOAC and 2233 were exposed to warfarin. For the primary effectiveness outcome of ischemic stroke, systemic embolism and transient ischemic attack, no significant association was observed between use of DOACs compared with warfarin (HR 1.19, 95% CI 0.96 to 1.48, p = 0.11). Use of DOACs was associated with lower risk of the primary safety outcome of intracranial hemorrhage, gastrointestinal bleeding, and other bleed (HR 0.69, 95% CI 0.56 to 0.85, p < 0.001). Results were consistent across multiple subgroups in the sensitivity analyses. These findings support the use of DOACs for AF in patients with BHVs.",

        "Abstract":"BACKGROUND: Compared with the general population, patients with advanced chronic kidney disease have a >10-fold higher burden of atrial fibrillation. Limited data are available guiding the use of nonvitamin K antagonist oral anticoagulants in this population.\nMETHODS: We compared the safety of apixaban with warfarin in 269 patients with atrial fibrillation and advanced chronic kidney disease (defined as creatinine clearance [CrCl] 25 to 30 mL\/min) enrolled in the ARISTOTLE trial (Apixaban for Reduction in Stroke and Other Thromboembolic Events in Atrial Fibrillation). Cox proportional models were used to estimate hazard ratios for major bleeding and major or clinically relevant nonmajor bleeding. We characterized the pharmacokinetic profile of apixaban by assessing differences in exposure using nonlinear mixed effects models.\nRESULTS: Among patients with CrCl 25 to 30 mL\/min, apixaban caused less major bleeding (hazard ratio, 0.34 [95% CI, 0.14-0.80]) and major or clinically relevant nonmajor bleeding (hazard ratio, 0.35 [95% CI, 0.17-0.72]) compared with warfarin. Patients with CrCl 25 to 30 mL\/min randomized to apixaban demonstrated a trend toward lower rates of major bleeding when compared with those with CrCl >30 mL\/min ( interaction=0.08) and major or clinically relevant nonmajor bleeding ( interaction=0.05). Median daily steady-state areas under the curve for apixaban 5 mg twice daily were 5512 ng\/(mL·h) and 3406 ng\/(mL·h) for patients with CrCl 25 to 30 mL\/min or >30 mL\/min, respectively. For apixaban 2.5 mg twice daily, the median exposure was 2780 ng\/(mL·h) for patients with CrCl 25 to 30 mL\/min. The area under the curve values for patients with CrCl 25 to 30 mL\/min fell within the ranges demonstrated for patients with CrCl >30 mL\/min.\nCONCLUSIONS: Among patients with atrial fibrillation and CrCl 25 to 30 mL\/min, apixaban caused less bleeding than warfarin, with even greater reductions in bleeding than in patients with CrCl >30 mL\/min. We observed substantial overlap in the range of exposure to apixaban 5 mg twice daily for patients with or without advanced chronic kidney disease, supporting conventional dosing in patients with CrCl 25 to 30 mL\/min. Randomized, controlled studies evaluating the safety and efficacy of apixaban are urgently needed in patients with advanced chronic kidney disease, including those receiving dialysis.

Between January 1, 2013, and November 30, 2018, a total of 581 451 patients with atrial fibrillation began rivaroxaban or apixaban treatment and were followed up for 4 years, through November 30, 2018.\nEXPOSURES: Rivaroxaban (n = 227 572) and apixaban (n = 353 879), either standard or reduced dose.\nMAIN OUTCOMES AND MEASURES: The primary outcome was a composite of major ischemic (stroke\/systemic embolism) and hemorrhagic (intracerebral hemorrhage\/other intracranial bleeding\/fatal extracranial bleeding) events. Secondary outcomes were nonfatal extracranial bleeding and total mortality (fatal ischemic\/hemorrhagic event or other death during follow-up). Rates, hazard ratios (HRs), and rate differences (RDs) were adjusted for baseline differences in comorbidity with inverse probability of treatment weighting.\nRESULTS: Study patients (mean age, 77.0 years; 291 966 [50.2%] women; 134 393 [23.1%] receiving reduced dose) had 474 605 person-years of follow-up (median [IQR] of 174 [62-397] days).

However, safety and effectiveness data from unselected patients with AF in everyday clinical practice in Japan are lacking.\nMETHODS: The Xarelto Post-Authorization Safety & Effectiveness Study in Japanese Patients with Atrial Fibrillation (XAPASS) is a real-world, prospective, single-arm, observational study mandated by the Japanese authority as postmarketing surveillance. XAPASS involves patients with nonvalvular AF prescribed rivaroxaban. The principal safety outcome is a composite of major and nonmajor bleeding events, and the primary effectiveness outcome is the incidence of ischemic stroke, hemorrhagic stroke, noncentral nervous system systemic embolism, and myocardial infarction.\nRESULTS: In total, 11 308 patients were enrolled from April 2012 to June 2014. Their age was 73.1 ± 9.9 years, and their CHADS  score was 2.2 ± 1.3. Female patients, patients aged ≥75 years, patients with a body weight of ≤50 kg, and patients with a creatinine clearance of <50 mL\/min constituted 38.1%, 48.7%, 19.5%, and 23.9% of all patients, respectively. Almost half (53.2%) of patients were prescribed other anticoagulants before starting rivaroxaban.\nCONCLUSIONS: Data from this study will supplement those from the J-ROCKET AF and provide practical information for the optimal use of rivaroxaban for stroke prevention in Japanese patients with AF (Clinicaltrials.gov: NCT01582737).",

In this study, we examined the association of concomitant use of VKA and dual antiplatelet therapy (DAPT) with clinical outcomes of this patient population.\nSTUDY DESIGN: A total of 4086 patients with STEMI who underwent primary percutaneous coronary intervention retrospectively investigated. Among these patients, a total of 286 patients who developed new-onset transient AF during hospitalization were enrolled. VKA group consisted of 116 patients treated with warfarin, aspirin, and clopidogrel, and DAPT group consisted of 170 patients treated with aspirin and clopidogrel.\nMEASURES AND OUTCOMES: One-year mortality, ischemic stroke, major, and minor bleeding were determined as clinical outcomes.\nRESULTS: Although VKA group had proportionally lower mortality (17.2% vs. 20.0%) and ischemic stroke (7.8% vs. 11.8%) compared with DAPT group, the differences did not reach to statistical significance, whereas the 1-year major bleeding had higher rates at VKA group and that had 3.5-times higher major bleeding than DAPT group. This relationship was persisted after multivariable analysis (hazard ratio = 3.37, 95% CI, 1.76-10.04, P = 0.012).\nCONCLUSIONS: There is not a widely accepted treatment algorithm in patients with STEMI who complicated with new-onset AF in clinical guidelines. The current study indicated that transient form of new-onset AF might not require long-term VKA. Besides, addition of VKA to DAPT therapy may increase the rates of major and minor bleeding.",

        "Abstract":"BACKGROUND: Novel oral anticoagulants and warfarin are widely used for stroke prevention in patients with atrial fibrillation. The anticoagulation status of patients receiving warfarin or rivaroxaban has been studied. In this study, we aimed to evaluate the effect of dabigatran and warfarin on preventing thrombin generation (TG).\nMETHODS: This retrospective study enrolled 237 nonvalvular atrial fibrillation (NVAF) subjects treated with 110 mg dabigatran etexilate twice daily and 224 NVAF patients received adjusted-dose warfarin (international normalized ratio [INR] of 2 to 3)). Coagulation assays, prothrombin fragment 1  +  2 (F), calibrated automated thrombogram, and thrombin-antithrombin complex (TAT) were detected at the steady state.\nRESULTS: Activated partial thromboplastin time (APTT), antithrombin III activity, fibrinogen, and lag time showed no difference between the two groups. Compared to the dabigatran group, prothrombin time and INR values were higher in the warfarin group (all  < .001). Thrombin time, endogenous thrombin potential, peak TG (C), F, and TAT were lower in the warfarin group. The inhibition of TG was still stronger in the warfarin group when the patients were divided into subgroups.\nCONCLUSION: Conventional coagulation assays are suboptimal for assessing the coagulation status of dabigatran. TG could be used as supplementary assays to evaluate the anticoagulation effect of oral anticoagulants. Our results suggest that warfarin may inhibit TG more aggressively than dabigatran in patients regardless of age and kidney function.",

        "Abstract":"Direct oral anticoagulants (DOACs) used in nonvalvular atrial fibrillation (NVAF) are dose-reduced in elderly and patients with impaired renal function. Only reduced dose dabigatran is concluded as having similar stroke risk reduction and lower risk of major bleeding than warfarin in the pivotal studies. In clinical practice, reduced dose is prescribed more often than expected making this an important issue. The objective of this study was to compare effectiveness and safety between reduced dose DOACs and high TTR warfarin treatment (TTR ≥ 70%) in NVAF. A Swedish anticoagulation registry was used in identifying eligible patients from July 2011 to December 2017. The study cohort consisted of 40,564 patients with newly initiated DOAC (apixaban, dabigatran, or rivaroxaban) (11,083 patients) or warfarin treatment (29,481 patients) after exclusion of 374,135 patients due to not being warfarin or DOAC naïve, not being prescribed reduced dose, having previous mechanical heart valve (MHV), or being under 18 years old. The median durations of follow up were 365, 419, 432 and 473 days for apixaban, dabigatran, rivaroxaban and warfarin, respectively. Warfarin TTR identified from Auricula was 70.0%. Endpoints (stroke and major bleeding) and baseline characteristics were collected from hospital administrative registers using ICD-10 codes. Cohorts were compared using weighted adjusted Cox regression after full optimal matching based on propensity scores. DOACs are associated with lower risk of major bleeding (HR with 95% CI) 0.85 (0.78-0.93), intracranial bleeding HR 0.64 (0.51-0.80), hemorrhagic stroke HR 0.68 (0.50-0.92), gastrointestinal bleeding HR 0.81 (0.69-0.96) and all-cause stroke HR 0.87 (0.76-0.99), than warfarin. Apixaban and dabigatran are associated with lower risk of major bleeding, HR 0.70 (0.63-0.78) and HR 0.80 (0.69-0.94), and rivaroxaban is associated with lower risk of ischemic stroke, HR 0.73 (0.59-0.96), with higher major bleeding risk, HR 1.31 (1.15-1.48), compared to warfarin. Apixaban is associated with higher all-cause mortality compared to warfarin, HR 1.12 (1.03-1.21). DOACs are associated with lower risk of major bleeding and all-cause stroke, than high quality warfarin treatment, with exception of rivaroxaban that carried higher risk of major bleeding and lower risk of stroke or systemic embolism. In this large observational registry-based NVAF cohort, DOACs are preferred treatment in patients with indication for DOAC dose reduction, even in a high TTR setting.",

This meta-analysis aimed to compare the efficacy and safety profile of non-vitamin K antagonist oral anticoagulants (NOACs) with warfarin in patients with atrial fibrillation and concomitant CAD.\nMATERIALS AND METHODS: We performed a trial-level meta-analysis of CAD subgroups from four trials of NOAC versus warfarin in patients with atrial fibrillation, comparing the primary trial endpoints (efficacy: stroke or systemic embolic event; safety: International Society on Thrombosis and Haemostasis major bleeding) in patients with versus those without CAD, and used interaction testing to assess for treatment effect modification.\nRESULTS: In total, 58,606 patients with established CAD were included in this meta-analysis. NOACs reduced the risk of stroke\/systemic embolic event irrespective of presence of CAD (CAD: 0.76 (0.56-1.04); no CAD: hazard ratio 0.77 (0.56-1.06); -INT 0.93). Similarly, there was no effect modification by presence of CAD for major bleeding (CAD: hazard ratio 0.92 (0.65-1.32), no CAD: 0.83 (0.61-1.12); -INT 0.46) or myocardial infarction (CAD: hazard ratio 0.95 (0.62-1.44); no CAD: hazard ratio 0.95 (0.60-1.50); -INT = 0.98). While NOACs reduced all-cause mortality in patients without CAD compared with warfarin (hazard ratio 0.85 (0.71-1.02)), there was no difference in mortality between NOACs and warfarin in the CAD group (hazard ratio 0.99 (0.82-1.20); -INT 0.01).\nCONCLUSION: The present meta-analysis of four trials supports that NOACs are safe and at least as effective as warfarin in patients with atrial fibrillation and established CAD.",

We describe the case of a 75-year-old man with IgA vasculitis and atrial fibrillation treated with rivaroxaban, who presented with macroscopic haematuria and an acute decline in renal function. Two months before referral, he noted palpable purpuric lesions and was diagnosed with IgA vasculitis based on skin biopsy findings; the skin lesion disappeared following treatment with a steroid external preparation. Renal biopsy revealed glomerular haemorrhage and red blood cell casts. Although rivaroxaban was withdrawn, his kidney function worsened and he was started on haemodialysis. His renal function did not recover. To the best of our knowledge, this is the first case of direct oral anticoagulant (DOAC)-related AKI in systemic vasculitis. During DOAC therapy, close monitoring of a patient's urinalysis results and their renal function may be required for patients with systemic vasculitis to avoid AKI.",

        "Abstract":"BACKGROUND AND PURPOSE: Data on clinical outcomes for nonvitamin K antagonist oral anticoagulant (NOACs) and warfarin in patients with atrial fibrillation and cancer are limited, and patients with active cancer were excluded from randomized trials. We investigated the effectiveness and safety for NOACs versus warfarin among patients with atrial fibrillation with cancer.\nMETHODS: In this nationwide retrospective cohort study from Taiwan National Health Insurance Research Database, we identified a total of 6274 and 1681 consecutive patients with atrial fibrillation with cancer taking NOACs and warfarin from June 1, 2012, to December 31, 2017, respectively. Propensity score stabilized weighting was used to balance covariates across study groups.\nRESULTS: There were 1031, 1758, 411, and 3074 patients treated with apixaban, dabigatran, edoxaban, and rivaroxaban, respectively. After propensity score stabilized weighting, NOAC was associated with a lower risk of major adverse cardiovascular events (hazard ratio, 0.63 [95% CI, 0.50–0.80]; P=0.0001), major adverse limb events (hazard ratio, 0.41 [95% CI, 0.24–0.70]; P=0.0010), venous thrombosis (hazard ratio, 0.37 [95% CI, 0.23–0.61]; P<0.0001), and major bleeding (hazard ratio, 0.73 [95% CI, 0.56–0.94]; P=0.0171) compared with warfarin. The outcomes were consistent with either direct thrombin inhibitor (dabigatran) or factor Xa inhibitor (apixaban, edoxaban, and rivaroxaban) use, among patients with stroke history, and among patients with different type of cancer and local, regional, or metastatic stage of cancer (P interaction >0.05). When compared with warfarin, NOAC was associated with lower risk of major adverse cardiovascular event, and venous thrombosis in patients aged <75 but not in those aged ≥75 years (P interaction <0.05).\nCONCLUSIONS: Thromboprophylaxis with NOACs rather than warfarin should be considered for the majority of the atrial fibrillation population with cancer.",

        "Published":null,
        "Abstract":"IMPORTANCE: The COMPASS (Cardiovascular Outcomes for People Using Anticoagulation Strategies) randomized clinical trial was stopped early owing to the efficacy of low-dose rivaroxaban plus aspirin in preventing major cardiovascular events. The main reason for early trial termination was the effect of combination therapy on reducing ischemic strokes.\nOBJECTIVE: To analyze the association between low-dose rivaroxaban with or without aspirin and different ischemic stroke subtypes.\nDESIGN, SETTING, AND PARTICIPANTS: This is a secondary analysis of a multicenter, double-blind, randomized, placebo-controlled study that was performed in 33 countries from March 12, 2013, to May 10, 2016. Patients with stable atherosclerotic vascular disease were eligible, and a total of 27 395 participants were randomized and followed up to February 6, 2017. All first ischemic strokes and uncertain strokes that occurred by this date were adjudicated using TOAST (Trial of Org 10172 in Acute Stroke Treatment) criteria. The analysis of ischemic stroke subtypes was evaluated using an intention-to-treat principle. Statistical analysis was performed from March 12, 2013, to February 6, 2017.\nINTERVENTIONS: Participants received rivaroxaban (2.5 mg twice a day) plus aspirin (100 mg once a day), rivaroxaban (5 mg twice a day), or aspirin (100 mg once a day).\nMAIN OUTCOMES AND MEASURES: Risk of ischemic stroke subtypes during follow-up.\nRESULTS: A total of 291 patients (66 women; mean [SD] age, 69.4 [8.5] years; 43 [14.8%] had a previous nonlacunar stroke) experienced an ischemic stroke. During the study, 49 patients (16.8%) received a diagnosis of atrial fibrillation. Applying TOAST criteria, 59 strokes (20.3%) were cardioembolic, 54 strokes (18.6%) were secondary to greater than 50% stenosis of the ipsilateral internal carotid artery, 42 strokes (14.4%) had a negative evaluation that met criteria for embolic stroke of undetermined source, and 21 strokes (7.2%) were secondary to small vessel disease. There were significantly fewer cardioembolic strokes (hazard ratio [HR], 0.40 [95% CI, 0.20-0.78]; P = .005) and embolic strokes of undetermined source (HR, 0.30 [95% CI, 0.12-0.74]; P = .006) in the combination therapy group compared with the aspirin-only group. A trend for reduction in strokes secondary to small vessel disease (HR, 0.36 [95% CI, 0.12-1.14]; P = .07) was not statistically significant. No significant difference was observed between the 2 groups in strokes secondary to greater than 50% carotid artery stenosis (HR, 0.85 [95% CI, 0.45-1.60]; P = .61). Rivaroxaban, 5 mg, twice daily showed a trend for reducing cardioembolic strokes compared with aspirin (HR, 0.57 [95% CI, 0.31-1.03]; P = .06) but was not associated with reducing other stroke subtypes.\nCONCLUSIONS AND RELEVANCE: For patients with systemic atherosclerosis, low-dose rivaroxaban plus aspirin was associated with large, significant reductions in cardioembolic strokes and embolic strokes of undetermined source. However, these results of exploratory analysis need to be independently confirmed before influencing clinical practice.\nTRIAL REGISTRATION: ClinicalTrials.gov identifier: NCT01776424.",

        "Abstract":"The use of direct oral anticoagulants (DOACs) is widely increasing in the United States (US). Warfarin has been the conventional anticoagulant used in the past few decades, but it has been gradually replaced by DOACs. The objective of the study was to analyze trends in utilization, reimbursement, and price for those anticoagulants in the US Medicaid population. Retrospective data analysis was conducted using the National Summary Files for the Medicaid State Drug Utilization Data. Study drugs included dabigatran, rivaroxaban, apixaban, edoxaban and warfarin. The study assessed secular trends of utilization, reimbursement, and per-prescription price. The data was collected from the first quarter of 2000 through to the second quarter of 2020 restricted for outpatient prescriptions only. During the 21-year study period, a substantial rise in total expenditures on warfarin and DOACs was observed from $144 million in 2000 to $694 million in 2020. Moreover, the utilization of DOACs has increased significantly since the first approval of Xarelto in 2010 from 1079 in 2011 to 1.5 million in 2019. The per-prescription price of DOACs increased from an average of $200 in 2011 to $407 in 2020. Conversely, the total number of prescriptions of Warfarin and branded Coumadin decreased from 2.4 million to 1.4 million and from 3.9 million to less than a million, respectively. The present study demonstrated a change in the trends of US expenditure and utilization for warfarin and DOACs with DOACs representing the majority of market share of both spending per prescription and reimbursement.",

        "Abstract":"['2', '2']\nThis study aims to provide real-world data about starting-dose of NOACs and dose-adjustment in patients with atrial fibrillation (AF). In fact, even if new oral anticoagulation agents (NOACs) have a predictable effect without need for regular monitoring, dose-adjustments should be performed according to the summary of product information and international guidelines. We employed the Italian Medicines Agency monitoring registries comprising data on a nationwide cohort of patients with AF treated with NOACs from 2013 to 2018. Logistic regression analysis was used to evaluate the determinants of dosage choice. During the reference period, treatment was commenced for 866,539 patients. Forty-five percent of the first prescriptions were dispensed at a reduced dose (dabigatran 60.3%, edoxaban 45.2%, apixaban 40.9%, rivaroxaban 37.4%). The prescription of reduced dose was associated with older age, renal disease, bleeding risk and the concomitant use of drugs predisposing to bleeding, but not with CHADS-VASc and HAS-BLED. A relative reduction of the proportion of patients treated with low dosages was evident overtime for dabigatran and rivaroxaban; whereas prescription of low dose apixaban and edoxaban increased progressively among elderly patients. Evidence based on real-world data shows a high frequency of low dose prescriptions of NOACs in AF patients. Except for older age, renal disease, bleeding risk and the concomitant use of drugs predisposing to bleeding, other factors that may determine the choice of reduced dose could not be ascertained. There may be potential under-treatment of AF patients, but further evaluation is warranted.",

However, there is a possibility that bisoprolol as significant P-glycoprotein inhibitor might interact with dabigatran.\nSTUDY QUESTION: To investigate the impact of concomitant bisoprolol therapy on dabigatran plasma level in patients with nonvalvular atrial fibrillation.\nSTUDY DESIGN: A pilot drug interaction study in 29 patients with nonvalvular atrial fibrillation on dabigatran therapy. Bisoprolol was administrated in 18 patients. Blood samples were collected at baseline (in the morning, before any medication was administered) and at hour 2 (2 hours after administration of dabigatran and bisoprolol).\nRESULTS: The dabigatran plasma level was significantly higher at baseline and at hour 2 in patients treated with bisoprolol compared with patients without bisoprolol therapy. In addition, we have shown that this increase is affected by dabigatran dosage and concomitant treatment with proton-pump inhibitor and digoxin. The impact of bisoprolol on dabigatran concentration was still significant despite these confounders.\nCONCLUSIONS: This study demonstrated the interaction between dabigatran and bisoprolol, which is modulated with dabigatran dosage and concomitant treatment with proton-pump inhibitor and digoxin.",

        "Published":null,
        "Abstract":"Clinicians struggle daily with the optimal regimen for patients with an indication for antiplatelet therapy after stenting and in patients needing oral anticoagulation treatment for atrial fibrillation (AF). This is not only difficult in patients with acute coronary syndrome (ACS) but also in the large number of patients with AF undergoing elective percutaneous coronary intervention (PCI). The challenge is to strike a balance between the increasing risk of bleeding events and ischemic or thrombotic events. Until recently, guidelines were based on expert consensus and a few small, many of them retrospective, trials. A so-called triple therapy with a vitamin K antagonist (VKA) and dual antiplatelet therapy (DAPT) with aspirin and clopidogrel was recommended for patients with AF undergoing PCI in stable coronary artery disease or for those with ACS. However, severe bleeding complications remain a major issue during triple therapy, particularly in the growing aging population. In the past year, randomized controlled trials (RCT) with direct-acting oral anticoagulants (DOACs) have modified the standard use of care, now favoring dual therapy with DOACs. This review elucidates the current influential RCTs on the new antiplatelet and anticoagulation strategies for patients with AF undergoing PCI or with ACS, and discusses whether triple therapy is still required.",

        "Published":"2018-02-03",
        "Abstract":"BACKGROUND: Oral anticoagulants are prescribed in non-valvular atrial fibrillation for stroke prevention; however, little is known about the current management of anticoagulation in France, particularly given the availability of non-vitamin K antagonist oral anticoagulants in recent years.\nAIMS: To describe the characteristics of patients prescribed oral anticoagulants, and assess treatment persistence in French primary care.\nMETHODS: We conducted a cohort study of patients with non-valvular atrial fibrillation, who were newly prescribed oral anticoagulants between 1 January 2014 and 31 January 2016, using French primary care data (IMS Longitudinal Patient Database). Adjusting for baseline characteristics, risk of non-persistence (switch or discontinuation) was compared using Cox regression.\nRESULTS: Of 4111 patients, 1710 were newly prescribed vitamin K antagonists, 1257 rivaroxaban, 744 apixaban and 400 dabigatran. The median age was 76 years, and 57.5% were male. History of hypertension was the most common co-morbidity (68.1%). Compared with vitamin K antagonists, non-persistence was higher with rivaroxaban (hazard ratio: 1.28; 95% confidence interval: 1.13-1.45) and dabigatran (hazard ratio: 1.42; 95% confidence interval: 1.20-1.69) and similar with apixaban (hazard ratio: 1.12; 95% confidence interval: 0.96-1.32).\nCONCLUSIONS: Non-persistence (treatment discontinuation or switch) with vitamin K antagonists was lower than with rivaroxaban and dabigatran in French primary care; however, non-persistence with the newest drug, apixaban, was similar to vitamin K antagonists. Larger studies with longer follow-up are needed to support these findings. This study is registered on ClinicalTrials.gov (NCT02488421).",
