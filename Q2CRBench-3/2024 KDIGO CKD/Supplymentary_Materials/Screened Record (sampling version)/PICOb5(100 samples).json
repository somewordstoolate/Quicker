        "Abstract":"Objectives Pseudoaneurysms are a well-recognized complication of percutaneous angiographic procedures. Ultrasound-guided thrombin injection is currently the preferred treatment modality. This study was undertaken to evaluate our experience with the management of post-procedure pseudoaneurysms. Methods A retrospective study was undertaken of all patients who developed a post-procedure pseudoaneurysm between March 2004 and January 2013. Data were obtained from our prospectively maintained non-invasive vascular laboratory data base. Results Overall, 167 patients (80 men) with post-procedure pseudoaneurysms were identified. The mean age was 66 years. Post-procedure pseudoaneurysms developed following diagnostic coronary angiography (38%), coronary angioplasty (37%), peripheral vascular interventions (14.7%), or other access procedures (7.6%). Mean post-procedure pseudoaneurysm diameter was 2.8 ± 1.8 cm. One hundred forty-two post-procedure pseudoaneurysms were injected with thrombin under ultrasound guidance. Primary success rate was 93.5%. There were 12 (8.5%) procedural failures of which seven (58%) responded to reinjection, three (25%) required operative management, one was treated with ultrasound-guided compression, and one (8.3%) was simply observed. On multivariate analysis, failures were associated with increased aneurysm diameter ( p = 0.006; odds ratio 2.23, 95% CI 1.25 to 3.96), end-stage renal disease ( p = 0.013; odds ratio 1.15, 95% CI 1.09 to 1.78) and superficial femoral artery aneurysm origin ( p = 0.031; odds ratio 0.20, 95% CI 0.04 to 0.86). There were two episodes of thrombus formation in the femoral artery; one resolved with anticoagulation alone, and the other required thrombectomy. Conclusions Percutaneous ultrasound-guided thrombin injection is an effective and safe method for managing post-procedure pseudoaneurysms. Failure rates are low and associated with large aneurysm size, superficial femoral artery origin and end-stage renal disease.",

        "Abstract":"OBJECTIVE: Secondary hyperparathyroidism (sHPT) is one of the most serious complications in patients on long-term hemodialysis. These patients may suffer from metabolic bone diseases, severe atherosclerosis, and undesirable cardiovascular events. Endoscopic parathyroidectomy with autotransplantation is a treatment option for those who do not respond to clinical management. This study aimed to investigate practical use of a self-made device in parathyroid autotransplantation for patients with sHPT, and to compare this device with ordinary surgical scissors.\nMETHODS: A total of 15 patients with sHPT were treated with endoscopic parathyroidectomy and autotransplantation. Pieces of parathyroid tissue were squeezed in our self-made device and injected into the brachioradialis muscle. Sixteen patients with sHPT who were treated with traditional parathyroid transplantation served as controls. Serum levels of parathyroid hormone, alkaline phosphatase, calcium, phosphorus and intact parathyroid hormone were measured before and after surgery.\nRESULTS: Preoperative symptoms were alleviated, and serum parathyroid hormone and alkaline phosphatase levels, hyperphosphatemia, and hypercalcemia were improved or normalized in all of the patients in both groups. Pathological examinations showed that parathyroid cells remained active.\nCONCLUSION: Application of our squeezing device is an economic, effective, and safe method in endoscopic parathyroidectomy and autotransplantation for patients with sHPT.",

Complex patients had at least one of the following characteristics: renal insufficiency (creatinine ≥ 140 µmol\/l); ejection fraction < 30%; acute myocardial infarction (MI) within previous 72 hrs; >1 lesion\/vessel; >2 vessels treated; lesion length > 27 mm; bifurcation; saphenous vein graft lesion; arterial bypass graft lesion; in-stent restenosis; unprotected left main lesion; lesion with thrombus; or lesion with total occlusion. Target vessel failure (TVF), the primary composite endpoint of the trial, was defined as cardiac death, target vessel-related MI, or target vessel revascularization.\nRESULTS: Among the 1,033 complex patients, 529 (51%) were treated with Resolute ZES and 504 (49%) with Xience V EES. Patient- and procedure-related characteristics were similar between DES groups. After 2-year follow-up, outcome was also similar between DES groups. TVF occurred in 12.1% of patients treated with Resolute ZES and 12.3% of patients treated with Xience V EES. In addition, DES groups did not differ significantly in cardiac death, MI, or target vessel revascularization-the individual components of TVF.\nCONCLUSION: Complex patients treated with Resolute ZES and Xience V EES showed similar safety and efficacy during 2-year follow-up. © 2014 Wiley Periodicals, Inc.",

        "Abstract":"BACKGROUND: Postoperative hemorrhage has been described at rates of 14% in kidney transplant (KT) literature. The preferred management of postoperative hemorrhage in this population is not well described. We hypothesized a difference in outcomes with operative versus nonoperative management of hemorrhage after kidney transplantation.\nMETHODS: We conducted a retrospective cohort study of consecutive KTs from 2012 to 2019 (living and deceased donors). We defined hemorrhage based on the objective finding of hematoma on either ultrasound or CT scan. Management was defined as operative (surgical intervention with or without transfusion) or nonoperative (with or without transfusion).\nRESULTS: We performed 1758 KTs of which 135 (8%) demonstrated hematoma on ultrasound or CT scan (66 operative vs 69 nonoperative management). The clinical signs and symptoms of low urine output ( = .044), drop in hemoglobin ( < .001), abdominal pain ( = .005), and MAP < 70 mm Hg ( = .034) were 92.5% predictive of postoperative hemorrhage in our KT patients. There were no differences between groups based on medical history, preop anticoagulation, anastomosis type, cold ischemic time, lowest hemoglobin, delayed graft function, or complications. Patients with nonoperative treatment of postoperative hemorrhage had shorter lengths of stay ( = .003), better graft survival ( = .01), and better patient survival ( = .01).\nDISCUSSION: We found better outcomes of graft and patient survival with shorter lengths of stay when we utilized nonoperative management of postoperative hemorrhage in KT patients. Our findings suggest a role for conservative nonoperative management in select patients. Ultimately, it is the surgeon's choice on how best to manage postoperative hemorrhage.",

        "Abstract":"INTRODUCTION: Organ availability is limited in the face of the growing number of candidates. Using organs from individuals with an infection at the time of transplantation emerged as a possible but controversial solution.\nMATERIALS AND METHODS: Retrospective analysis of patients submitted to kidney transplantation in Hospital Garcia de Orta (Almada, Portugal) from January 2008 to March 2019, comparing outcomes between recipients of organs from donors with an active infection and noninfected donors in the referred interval.\nRESULTS: An active infection in the donor was identified in 55 cases (28.4%) from a total of 194 transplants. The most frequent site of infection was the lung (n = 30), followed by the urinary tract (n = 13); 9 donors (16.4%) had documented bacteremia. None of the identified microorganisms were multidrug-resistant. All recipients from an infected donor received adequate antibiotic prophylaxis (mean duration of 11.1 ± 3.0 days). No significant differences between groups were found regarding patients' demographics, cold ischemia time, duration of hospital stay, delayed graft function, rejection episodes, noninfectious complications, or patient and graft survival. Basiliximab was the preferred induction agent in both groups but was used in a larger proportion of recipients in the infected donor group (87.0% vs 60.6%; P = .001). The rate of infectious complications was significantly lower in the infected donor group (14.5% vs 42.4%; P = .001), and none of the previously isolated agents in the donor was found in the recipient.\nCONCLUSION: Kidney transplant using infected donors can be performed safely, without worse organ-specific or recipient outcomes, if certain conditions are considered.",

        "Abstract":"Drug-eluting stents (DES) were first used on-label - in simple patients with low clinical risk and easily accessible lesions. Currently, DES are increasingly used off-label - in complex patients undergoing percutaneous coronary interventions (PCI) with historically higher event risk. Therefore, our aim was to investigate whether patients with off-label indications for DES use had similar outcomes compared to patients who were treated for on-label indications only. We analysed two-year follow-up data of 1,387 TWENTE trial patients, treated with second-generation everolimus-eluting XIENCE V or zotarolimus-eluting Resolute stents, and compared off-label vs. on-label DES use with regard to the following clinical endpoints: cardiac death, myocardial infarction (MI), periprocedural MI (≤48 hrs), and target vessel revascularisation (TVR). Patients with off-label DES use (n=1,033; 74.5%) had more diabetes (22.9% vs. 17.5%; p=0.032), previous MI (35.9% vs. 22.3%; p<0.001), type B2\/C lesions (84.7% vs. 62.7%; p<0.001), and acute coronary syndromes (57.8% vs. 33.3%; p<0.001). Nevertheless, cardiac death and TVR rates were similar to those of patients with on-label DES use (p>0.8). Following off-label DES use, there was a higher incidence of PMI (5.0% vs. 1.4%; p=0.003), of which only 1.1% reached creatine kinase levels >5x the upper limit of normal (ULN). Despite differences in risk profile, patients with off-label DES use did not differ from patients with on-label DES use in clinical endpoints other than periprocedural MI. These largely positive findings underline the favourable safety profile of second-generation DES.",

        "Abstract":"OBJECTIVES: Aprotinin is a drug used to reduce bleeding in patients undergoing cardiothoracic surgery with cardiopulmonary bypass. A recent cohort evaluation found elevated risks of renal, cardiovascular, and cerebrovascular events when aprotinin was used. We sought to determine the impact of aprotinin on safety variables among patients receiving cardiothoracic surgery with cardiopulmonary bypass from a single US hospital that reserves aprotinin for complex surgeries and Jehovah's Witnesses and does not utilize celite-based activated clotting time determinations.\nMETHODS: We performed a cohort evaluation with multivariate logistic regression, including propensity score adjustment comprising patients from January 1, 2000 and December 31, 2005. We evaluated 3348 patients having cardiothoracic surgery in a single tertiary care medical center. We observed aprotinin use or lack of aprotinin in cardiothoracic surgery. The main outcome measures were odds (expressed as an odds ratio with 95% confidence interval) of developing myocardial infarction, cerebrovascular events, and renal dysfunction after cardiothoracic surgery between groups.\nRESULTS: Patients receiving aprotinin were less likely to experience a cerebrovascular event compared with control [0.65 (0.46-0.91)] and did not have an elevated odds of myocardial infarction [1.04 (0.53-2.04)] but were more likely to experience postoperative renal dysfunction [2.03 (1.37-3.01)].\nCONCLUSIONS: Aprotinin was not associated with negative myocardial or cerebrovascular risks but did increase the risk of renal dysfunction.

        "Abstract":"BACKGROUND: Early graft function is crucial for successful kidney transplantation. Maintaining adequate hydration is complicated by rapid movement of water to the extravascular space. We designed this study to test the effect of maximal hydration during graft ischemia time on early renal function.\nMETHODS: Forty adult patients with chronic renal failure underwent renal transplantation from related living donors. Study subjects were randomly assigned 1 of 2 regimens for intraoperative hydration. The constant infusion rate group received normal saline 0.9% at an infusion rate 10 to 12 mL . kg(-1) . h(-1) from the start of surgery until the renal vessels were unclamped after vascular anastomosis. The central venous pressure target (CVPT) group received normal saline 0.9% titrated to maintain a specific central venous pressure (CVP). The target CVP from the start of surgery until clamping of the donor renal vessels was 5 mm Hg except for the interval from clamping of the renal vessels until the end of renal vascular anastomosis, when the target CVP was 15 mm Hg. Perioperative hemodynamics, infused saline volumes, rate of infusion, onset of diuresis, graft turgidity, urine volume, and renal function during the first 5 postoperative days were recorded.\nRESULTS: At the end of renal ischemia time, both groups had received approximately 3 L crystalloid solution. The CVPT group achieved the highest peak of intravascular volume expansion with an average infusion rate of 48.3 mL . min(-1) during 48 +\/- 12 minutes of renal ischemia. The CVPT group had better graft function, required fewer vasopressors and diuretics, and had less postoperative tissue edema than the constant infusion rate group.\nCONCLUSIONS: Hydration directed toward maintaining a given CVP during kidney transplantation produced a more stable hemodynamic profile and promoted diuresis. The calculated infusion rate of approximately 45 to 50 mL . min(-1), within an hour ischemia time, seems feasible to enhance early graft function. A larger trial with long-term follow-up of renal function is warranted to confirm the clinical benefit of titrating IV crystalloid administration to maintain a given CVP in this population.",

        "Published":"2017-01-09",
        "Abstract":"INTRODUCTION: The Revised Cardiac Risk Index (RCRI) is a popular classification system to estimate patients' risk of postoperative cardiac complications based on preoperative risk factors. Renal impairment, defined as serum creatinine >2.0 mg\/dL (177 µmol\/L), is a component of the RCRI. The estimated glomerular filtration rate has become accepted as a more accurate indicator of renal function. We will externally validate the RCRI in a modern cohort of patients undergoing non-cardiac surgery and update its renal component.\nMETHODS AND ANALYSIS: The Vascular Events in Non-cardiac Surgery Patients Cohort Evaluation (VISION) study is an international prospective cohort study. In this prespecified secondary analysis of VISION, we will test the risk estimation performance of the RCRI in ∼34 000 participants who underwent elective non-cardiac surgery between 2007 and 2013 from 29 hospitals in 15 countries. Using data from the first 20 000 eligible participants (the derivation set), we will derive an optimal threshold for dichotomising preoperative renal function quantified using the Chronic Kidney Disease Epidemiology Collaboration (CKD-Epi) glomerular filtration rate estimating equation in a manner that preserves the original structure of the RCRI. We will also develop a continuous risk estimating equation integrating age and CKD-Epi with existing RCRI risk factors. In the remaining (approximately) 14 000 participants, we will compare the risk estimation for cardiac complications of the original RCRI to this modified version. Cardiac complications will include 30-day non-fatal myocardial infarction, non-fatal cardiac arrest and death due to cardiac causes. We have examined an early sample to estimate the number of events and the distribution of predictors and missing data, but have not seen the validation data at the time of writing.\nETHICS AND DISSEMINATION: The research ethics board at each site approved the VISION protocol prior to recruitment.

        "Abstract":"Chronic kidney disease (CKD) is a risk factor for poor outcomes in patients with coronary artery disease (CAD), but it is unknown whether CKD influences the efficacy of alternative CAD treatment strategies. Thus, we compared outcomes in stable CAD patients with and without CKD randomized to percutaneous coronary intervention (PCI) and optimal medical therapy (OMT) or OMT alone in a post hoc analysis of the 2,287 patient COURAGE study. At baseline, 320 patients (14%) had CKD defined as a glomerular filtration rate of <60 mL\/min\/1.73 m(2), as estimated by the abbreviated 4-variable Modification of Diet in Renal Disease equation. The patients with CKD were older (68 +\/- 9 vs 61 +\/- 10 years; p <0.001) and more often had diabetes mellitus (42% vs 33%; p = 0.002), hypertension (81% vs 65%; p <0.03), heart failure (13% vs 3.4%; p <001), and three-vessel CAD (37% vs 29%, p = 0.01). After adjustment for these differences, CKD remained an independent predictor of death or nonfatal myocardial infarction (hazard ratio 1.48, 95% confidence interval 1.15 to 1.90). PCI had no effect on these outcomes. Furthermore, at 36 months, a similar percentage of patients with CKD treated with OMT (70%) and PCI plus OMT (76%) were angina free compared to patients without CKD. In conclusion, CKD is an important determinant of clinical outcomes in patients with stable CAD, regardless of the treatment strategy. Although PCI did not reduce the risk of death or myocardial infarction when added to OMT for patients with CKD, it also was not associated with worse outcomes in this high-risk group.",

This study compared the effects of normal saline (NS) and Plasmalyte on acid-base balance and electrolytes during living donor kidney transplantation using the Stewart and base excess (BE) methods.\nMETHODS: Patients were randomized to an NS group (n = 30) or a Plasmalyte group (n = 30). Arterial blood samples were collected for acid-base analysis after induction of anesthesia (T0), prior to clamping the iliac vein (T1), 10 minutes after reperfusion of the donated kidney (T2), and at the end of surgery (T3). In addition serum creatinine and 24-hour urine output were recorded on postoperative days 1,2, and 7. Over the first postoperative 7 days we recorded episodes of graft failure requiring dialysis.\nRESULTS: Compared with the Plasmalyte group, the NS group showed significantly lower values of pH, BE, and effective strong ion differences during the postreperfusion period (T2 and T3). Chloride-related values (chloride [Cl(-)], free-water corrected Cl(-), BEcl) were significantly higher at T1, T2, and T3, indicating hyperchloremic rather than dilutional metabolic acidosis. Early postoperative graft functions in terms of serum creatinine, urine output, and graft failure requiring dialysis were not significantly different between the groups.\nCONCLUSIONS: Both NS and Plamalyte can be used safely during uncomplicated living donor kidney transplantation. However, Plasmalyte more stably maintains acid-base and electrolyte balance compared with NS especially during the postreperfusion period.",

        "Abstract":"The efficacy and safety of (1-28) alpha-human ANP in preventing acute tubular necrosis (ATN) in cadaveric renal transplantation was tested by comparing ANP infusion with a maximal hydration (MH) regimen which we previously reported as effective in lowering the incidence of ATN (1, 2). Since the production of endogenous ANP increases with volume overloading (3), we hypothesized that increased endogenous ANP production may contribute to the beneficial effects of MH in renal transplant recipients. We thus conducted an open randomized study comparing the effect on early renal allograft function of MH (control group) versus moderate hydration plus ANP infusion (ANP group). Forty patients were blindly paired in two groups of 20 according to the duration of cold ischemia time (mean +\/- 2 h). The demographic characteristics of donors and recipients were similar. Using a Swan-Ganz catheter, hemodynamic parameters were monitored for 4 h after transplantation. The group receiving ANP and moderate hydration was perfused to a mean pulmonary arterial pressure (PAP) of < or = 20 mmHg. The PAP in patients receiving MH was driven to > or = 25 mmHg. In the ANP group, a bolus of 100 micrograms of ANP was infused into the graft's renal artery at the time of unclamping, followed by 24 h of continuous intravenous infusion at 0.03 microgram\/kg\/min. Thereafter, the patients received ANP at a rate of 0.01 microgram\/kg\/min until the serum creatinine reached < 2 mg\/dl. As a consequence of the hydration regimen, the PAP at unclamping was lower in the ANP group than in the control group; 20 +\/- 3 and 26 +\/- 4 mmHg, respectively (p < 0.05). The ANP plasma levels were significantly higher during the first 3 d in the ANP group (p < 0.001). The median recovery rate of renal function was similar in both groups. No patients in the ANP group experienced ATN while 4 patients (20%) in the control group did (p = 0.125). The need for hemodialysis was markedly reduced in the ANP group compared to the control group (1 ANP-treated patient required dialysis once whereas 5 patients from the control group underwent dialysis a total of 26 times; p = 0.068). ANP administration was well-tolerated and no hypotensive episodes were reported. This preliminary study suggests that ANP infusion is at least as effective as maximal hydration in preventing ATN and represents an efficient alternative for transplantation centers which do not use maximal hydration as a standard regimen in managing kidney allograft recipients.",

It has been hypothesized that remifentanil would provide a safe anesthesia with no impact on myocardial function and with positive effects on extubation time and mobilization.\nMETHODS: We compared the postoperative course of patients, the remifentanil group (RG) and the low-dose fentanyl group (LDFG), in whom remifentanil and low-dose fentanyl, respectively, were used for fast-track cardiac anesthesia. The study was designed as a prospective randomized study. The primary outcomes were changes in the cardiac index and creatine kinase MB fraction (CKMB), extubation times, mobilization times, and lengths of stay in the intensive care unit (ICU) and the hospital. Frequency of myocardial infarction (MI), reoperations due to excessive bleeding, renal impairment, and cerebral complications were registered as well.\nRESULTS: Seventy-one patients were enrolled in the study, and 7 were excluded due to difficult airway, bleeding, and technical difficulties. The RG comprised 33 patients and the LDFG comprised of 31 patients. There were no differences between the groups in terms of age, Euroscore, types of surgery, extracorporeal circulation, and aortic cross-clamp time. We did not find significant difference in cardiac index, CKMB, extubation times, mobilization times, length of stay in the ICU and in the hospital between the groups. Postoperative complications such as MI, rates of reoperations, renal and cerebral complications and incidence of atrial fibrillation did not show any significant differences.\nCONCLUSIONS: Remifentanil fast-track anesthesia for cardiac patients has no negative impact on myocardial function. Both remifentanil and low-dose fentanyl are equally effective and safe for fast-track cardiac anesthesia. The study did not highlight any statistical superiority of remifentanil anesthesia over low-dose fentanyl anesthesia.",

        "Published":"2011-01-19",
        "Abstract":"BACKGROUND: Based on Acute Kidney Injury Network (AKIN) criteria, we considered acute kidney injury (AKI) as an absolute increase in the serum creatinine (sCr) level of more than or equal to 0.3 mg\/dl or 50%. The introduction of Urinary neutrophil gelatinase-associated lipocalin (UNGAL) has conferred earlier diagnosis of AKI. Pentoxifylline (PTX), a non-specific phosphodiesterase inhibitor, can suppress the production of some factors of inflammatory response and presumably prevent AKI. We examined the PTX on the development of AKI in cardiac surgery patients by measuring the levels of UNGAL.\nMATERIALS AND METHODS: We performed a double blind randomized clinical trial, enrolling 28 consecutive patients undergoing elective coronary artery bypass graft (CABG) surgery. Patients were divided into two groups, one to receive PTX 5 mg\/kg intravenous bolus injection, followed by 1.5 mg\/kg\/h continuous intravenous infusion until 3 hours after cessation of CPB and the other group received placebo. UNGAL was measured before, 3 and 24 hours after surgery. In addition serum creatinine was measured before and 24, 48, 72 and 96 hours after surgery and C-reactive protein (CRP) only 24 hours postoperatively.\nRESULTS: Both groups did not differ in demographic and baseline characteristics. 12 patients developed AKI 48 hours after surgery; 5 of them were in the intervention group and 7 in the control group (p= 0.445). There was an increase of UNGAL in both groups postoperatively, although not significant. Mean sCr was significantly increased in the control group at 24 and 48 hours after surgery (24-h mean: 0.79 ± 0.18 mg\/dl vs. 1.03 ± 0.43 mg\/dl, P value = 0.02; 48-h mean: 1.17 ± 0.24 mg\/dl vs. 0.98 ± 0.20 mg\/dl, P value = 0.03, respectively). PTX had a positive effect in preventing AKI reflecting in changes in sCr, and the increase of UNGAL was consistent with the emergence of AKI (Pearson's correlation = 0.30).\nCONCLUSION: Our study demonstrates a weak correlation between UNGAL and sCr after cardiac surgery. The rise of UNGAL in these patients may be reduced by administration of PTX although we did not show significance. PTX could reduce the occurrence of AKI as determined by attenuation of sCr rise without causing hemodynamic instability or increased bleeding. Overall, we suggest future studies with larger sample sizes to elucidate this effect and determine the different aspects of administrating PTX.\nTRIAL REGISTRATION: ISRCTN: IRCT138807302622N1.",

The diabetic complications, previous photocoagulation, intravitreal injections before PPV, ocular findings during PPV, surgical details, short-term visual outcome and post-PPV complications were recorded and compared between patients with and without impaired renal function.\nRESULTS: 149 patients had normal renal function (67.7%), and 71 (32.3%) patients had impaired renal function; 85.4% of patients were identified with chronic kidney disease (CKD) during the preoperative assessment. Impaired renal function was related to hypertension (3.40[1.58-7.29], p = 0.002), incomplete pan-retinal photocoagulation (PRP) (3.18[1.50-6.72], p = 0.002), severe fibrovascular membrane (8.19[3.43-19.54], p<0.001), and extensive retinal vascular closure (3.40[1.54-7.52], p = 0.002).

        "Abstract":"BACKGROUND: Steroid minimization regimens have become increasingly popular for kidney transplant recipients. We studied outcomes for liver transplant recipients with a regimen using rapid discontinuation of prednisone (RDP).\nRESULTS: The study group consisted of 83 recipients transplanted between June 2004 and January 2006. Immunosuppression consisted of tacrolimus, MMF, and two doses of basiliximab with six d of steroids. Patients with underlying autoimmune disorders (PSC, autoimmune hepatitis) were not included as they were maintained on steroids. The control group consisted of 83 recipients transplanted between January 2002 and May 2004. Immunosuppression consisted of tacrolimus, MMF and steroids, with no antibody induction. Mean MELD score at time of transplant was significantly higher in the steroid free group vs. the control group (28 vs. 23, p = 0.02); mean donor age was also higher (42 vs. 37 yr, p = 0.02). Other characteristics including recipient age, cold ischemic time, donor source, and cause of liver disease were similar (p = ns). Mean length of follow-up was 16.1 months in the RDP group and 32 months in the control group; a minimum of six months follow up was present for all patients. Patient and graft survival rates were not statistically different in the two groups (p = ns). Biopsy proven rejection was low in both groups and not significantly different (at one yr post-transplant 11% in the RDP group vs. 12% in control, p = 0.53). Based on protocol biopsy data, histologic recurrence of hepatitis C was demonstrated in 56% of the control group hepatitis C positive recipients vs. 39% in the RDP group (p = 0.05). There was a significantly lower incidence of post-transplant diabetes (PTDM) in the RDP vs. control group (at 6 months post-transplant 12% vs. 32%, p = 0.004).\nCONCLUSIONS: Rapid discontinuation of prednisone in liver transplant recipients is not associated with an increased risk of rejection, and may be associated with lower morbidity, especially PTDM and hepatitis C recurrence.",

        "Abstract":"Efforts to increase the donor pool of available organs have resulted in some unconventional kidney transplantation procedures. One of these is the use of elderly donors for both living and cadaver kidney transplantations. The aim of this study was to review our experience with kidney transplants from living elderly donors. During a period of 10 years, 70 living renal transplantations were performed. In 32 transplants the age of the donor was above 65 years (mean 69 +\/- 4 years, range: 65 to 81 years) and in 10 of these 32 transplants the age of the donor was over 70 years. The survival rate was compared with that of 38 transplants from younger donors (mean age 51 +\/- 6 years, range: 24 to 59 years). The time to cold and warm ischemia, the preservation procedure and time to anastomosis of blood vessels were comparable in both groups of donors. Immunosuppression included a sequential quadruple protocol, using thymoglobulin (ATG), prednisolone (PRED), azathioprin (AZA) and cyclosporin A (CsA), which replaced ATG\/PRED after day seven. A triple drug maintenance therapy (AZA, PRED, CsA) was used in all recipients. Kaplan-Meier survival curves at 1, 3 and 5 years showed that graft survival was 88%, 79% and 64% respectively for grafts from the advanced age donor group and 92%, 82% and 68% respectively for grafts from the younger donor group. The difference was slightly statistically significant (p < 0.05). Functioning of the graft was delayed in six patients who had received grafts from elderly donors and in one patient who had received a graft from a young donor. Despite worse results in transplantation with grafts from elderly donors, we consider this population as an important source of kidneys, which might help solve the present organ shortage, especially in our region.",

Because sufficient data on intravenous angiotensin-converting enzyme inhibitors following coronary artery bypass surgery complicated by postoperative left ventricular dysfunction are unavailable, the efficacy and safety of intravenously administered enalaprilat were evaluated.\nDESIGN: A placebo-controlled, randomized, double-blind protocol.\nSETTING: Postoperative intensive care unit at the German Heart Institute Berlin.\nPATIENTS: Forty patients with a left ventricular ejection fraction <35% following coronary artery bypass surgery on the second postoperative day or after weaning from intra-aortic balloon counterpulsation.\nINTERVENTIONS: A loading dose of enalaprilat 0.625 mg infused over 1 hr was followed by 5 mg\/24 hrs administered continuously for up to 72 hrs.\nMEASUREMENTS AND MAIN RESULTS: Systemic and pulmonary hemodynamic variables, blood gases, hormonal variables, renal function, and electrolytes were measured before and repeatedly during therapy. Acute effects were as follows: At 1 hr, enalaprilat increased the cardiac index (p <.001), stroke volume index (p <.001), and right ventricular stroke work index (p <.03) compared with placebo, whereas mean arterial pressure (p <.008) and both systemic (p <.001) and pulmonary (p <.02) vascular resistance decreased. Continuous effects were as follows: Over 72 hrs, enalaprilat decreased diastolic pulmonary artery pressure (p <.019), pulmonary artery occlusion pressure (p <.02), and central venous pressure (p <.02). The cardiac and stroke volume indexes were consistently higher in the enalaprilat group, whereas systemic and pulmonary vascular resistances were lower. The arterial blood-pressure lowering effect was blunted and heart rate remained unchanged. Mixed venous oxygenation (p <.02) was higher and arterial oxygenation was not modified. Finally, enalaprilat increased creatinine clearance (p <.002) and decreased creatinine (p <.02) and urea (p <.03).\nCONCLUSIONS: Intravenous enalaprilat safely and effectively improves cardiac and renal function following coronary artery bypass surgery complicated by postoperative left ventricular dysfunction.",

Independent factors related to initiation of and persistence with P2Y12 inhibitors were analysed by multivariable logistic regression and a Cox proportional hazards model. Patients were stratified by revascularization strategy: percutaneous coronary intervention (PCI), coronary artery bypass graft (CABG), or medical therapy alone (MTA). Overall, 79 597 MI patients were included with 39 172 undergoing PCI, 2619 CABG, and 16 640 MTA, showing initiation of P2Y12 inhibitors of 93.4%, 49.0%, and 51.5%, respectively. Congestive heart failure, cerebrovascular disease, cardiac dysrhythmias, renal failure, previous bleeding, and oral anticoagulants were associated with less initiation of P2Y12 inhibitors. Female sex was associated with less initiation of P2Y12 inhibitors following MTA. MTA, coronary angiography, cerebrovascular disease, diabetes with complications, previous bleeding, antidiabetics, and ticagrelor as P2Y12 inhibitor were associated with non-persistence, whereas female sex, advanced age, and concomitant pharmacotherapy with angiotensin-converting enzyme inhibitors, beta-blockers, statins, oral anticoagulants, and aspirin were associated with high persistence.\nCONCLUSION: Initiation of P2Y12 inhibitors in PCI-treated MI patients was high in contrast to those treated with CABG or MTA and patients with certain comorbidities. Further studies on the benefit-risk ratio of P2Y12 inhibitors in CABG-treated or MTA-treated patients and patients with comorbidities after first-time MI are warranted, as is focus on persistence among patients receiving MTA, patients with comorbidities, and users of ticagrelor.",

One hundred forty-four patients with mild renal insufficiency (serum creatinine >1.1 to <2.0 mg\/dl) undergoing an elective coronary procedure were randomly assigned to the following 2 groups: standard hydration with sodium chloride plus single-bolus intravenous administration of sodium bicarbonate (20 mEq) immediately before contrast exposure (group A, n = 72) and standard hydration alone (group B, n = 72). The primary end point was development of CIN, defined as an increase >25% or >0.5 mg\/dl in serum creatinine within 3 days after the procedure. Incidence of the primary end point was lower in group A than in group B (1.4% vs 12.5%, p = 0.017). Incidence of adverse clinical events (acute pulmonary edema, acute renal failure requiring dialysis, and death within 7 days of procedure) did not differ between the 2 groups (0% vs 1.4%). In conclusion, single-bolus intravenous administration of sodium bicarbonate in addition to standard hydration can more effectively prevent CIN than standard hydration alone in patients with mild renal insufficiency undergoing an elective coronary procedure.",

The patient presented with various medical problems including hypertension, intracranial hemorrhage, myocardial infarction, unstable angina pectoris, and poor control of diabetic mellitus and had exhibited rapid symptoms of androgen excess such as progressive hirsutism and bilateral temporal balding for half a year. Tumor survey was negative except for an elevated testosterone level. Renal vein catheterization successfully detected a right ovarian androgen-secreting tumor. Because the patient was deemed medically unable to tolerate surgery, she received an alternative treatment consisting of 6 months of gonadotropin-releasing hormone-agonist (GnRH-a) and add-back hormone replacement therapy (HRT). Serum testosterone levels returned to normal limits after administration of the first dose of GnRH-a. A follow-up tumor survey was negative. The patient has been alive and free of disease for 8 months after six doses of GnRH-a. We conclude that this strategy might be used as urgent therapy in a medically compromised patient with presumed ovarian androgen-secreting tumor.",

        "Abstract":"The purpose of the study was to determine the incidence of cardiovascular disease (CVD) among people living with human immunodeficiency virus (HIV)\/acquired immunodeficiency syndrome (PLWHA) in Taiwan. PLWHA were identified from the Taiwan Centers for Disease Control HIV Surveillance System between 2000 and 2014. To examine the effect of active antiretroviral therapy (HAART) on CVD incidence, incidence densities and standardised incidence rates (SIRs) of CVD were calculated after stratifying PLWHA by HAART. Of 26 272 PLWHA (mean age, 32.3 years) identified, 73.4% received HAART. Compared with general population, SIRs (95% confidence interval) were higher for incident coronary artery disease (1.11 (1.04-1.19)), percutaneous coronary intervention (1.32 (1.18-1.47)), coronary artery bypass surgery (1.47 (1.29-1.66)), sudden cardiac death (3.01 (2.39-3.73)), heart failure (1.50 (1.31-1.70)) and chronic kidney disease (1.95 (1.81-2.10)), but was lower for incident atrial fibrillation (0.53 (0.37-0.73)). Considering the effect of HAART on incident CVD, the SIRs for all-cause, ischaemic and haemorrhagic stroke were higher in PLWHA who did not receive HAART, but were lower in PLWHA who received HAART. PLWHA had higher risks of incident coronary artery disease, percutaneous coronary intervention, coronary artery bypass surgery, sudden cardiac death, heart failure and chronic kidney disease. HAART reduces risks of incident CVD in PLWHA.",

        "Abstract":"BACKGROUND: Iloprost, a stable prostacyclin analog, is used as a rescue therapy for severe peripheral arterial disease (PAD). It has systemic vasodilatory and anti-aggregant effects, with severe vasodilatation potentially causing organ ischaemia when severe atherosclerosis is the underlying cause. In this study, we retrospectively analysed renal outcomes after iloprost infusion therapy in 86 patients.\nMETHODS: Eighty-six patients with PAD who received iloprost infusion therapy were retrospectively analysed. Clinical and biochemical parameters were recorded before (initial, Cr1), during (third day, Cr2), and after (14th day following the termination of infusion therapy, Cr3) treatment. Acute kidney injury (AKI) was defined according to KDIGO guidelines as a ≥ 0.3 mg\/dl (26.52 µmol\/l) increase in creatinine levels from baseline within 48 hours.\nRESULTS: Cr2 (1.46 ± 0.1 mg\/dl) (129.06 ± 8.84 µmol\/l) and Cr3 (1.53 ± 0.12 mg\/dl) (135.25 ± 10.61 µmol\/l) creatinine levels were significantly higher compared to the initial value (1.15 ± 0.6 mg\/dl) (101.66 ± 53.04 µmol\/l). AKI was observed in 36 patients (41.86%) on the third day of iloprost infusion. Logistic regression analysis revealed smoking and not using acetylsalicylic acid as primary predictors (p = 0.02 and p = 0.008, respectively) of AKI during iloprost treatment. On the third infusion day, patients' urinary output significantly increased (1813.30 ± 1123.46 vs 1545.17 ± 873.00 cm) and diastolic blood pressure significantly decreased (70.07 ± 15.50 vs 74.14 ± 9.42 mmHg) from their initial values.\nCONCLUSION: While iloprost treatment is effective in patients with PAD who are not suitable for surgery, severe systemic vasodilatation can cause renal ischaemia, resulting in nonoliguric AKI. Smoking, no acetylsalicylic acid use, and lower diastolic blood pressure are the clinical risk factors for AKI during iloprost treatment.",

        "Abstract":"BACKGROUND: The safety and efficiency of intravenous administration of tranexamic acid (TXA) in coronary artery bypass grafting (CABG) remains unconfirmed. Therefore, we conducted a meta-analysis on this topic.\nMETHODS: We searched the Cochrane Central Register of Controlled Trials (CENTRAL), PUBMED and EMBASE for randomized controlled trials on the topic. The results of this work are synthetized and reported in accordance with the PRISMA statement.\nRESULTS: Twenty-eight studies met our inclusion criteria. TXA reduced the incidence of postoperative reoperation of bleeding (relative risk [RR], 0.46; 95% confidence interval [CI]; 0.31-0.68), the frequency of any allogeneic transfusion (RR, 0.64; 95% CI, 0.52-0.78) and the postoperative chest tube drainage in the first 24 h by 206 ml (95% CI - 248.23 to - 164.15). TXA did not significantly affect the incidence of postoperative cerebrovascular accident (RR, 0.93; 95%CI, 0.62-1.39), mortality (RR, 0.82; 95%CI, 0.53-1.28), myocardial infarction (RR, 0.90; 95%CI, 0.78-1.05), acute renal insufficiency (RR, 1.01; 95%CI, 0.77-1.32). However, it may increase the incidence of postoperative seizures (RR, 6.67; 95%CI, 1.77-25.20). Moreover, the subgroup analyses in on-pump and off-pump CABG, the sensitivity analyses in trials randomized more than 99 participants and sensitivity analyses that excluded the study with the largest number of participants further strengthened the above results.\nCONCLUSIONS: TXA is effective to reduce reoperation for bleeding, blood loss and the need for allogeneic blood products in patients undergoing CABG without increasing prothrombotic complication.

Chronic kidney disease was defined as creatinine clearance <60 mL\/min. A total of 1786 propensity-matched patients from 4006 patients with chronic kidney disease undergoing index revascularization for multivessel disease with either DES or isolated CABG (n=893 each group) were analyzed. Baseline and procedural characteristics between percutaneous coronary intervention and CABG groups were well-balanced, including urgent revascularization priority, diabetes mellitus, left ventricular function, and 3-vessel disease. The 1-, 2-, and 3-year Kaplan-Meier survival analyses in propensity-matched patients favored CABG (93.2% versus 89.3%; 86.6% versus 80.3%; 80.8% versus 71.5%, respectively; P<0.001).

The 2-year unadjusted cumulative incidence of major adverse cardiac events was 17.8% in the DES group and 21.0% in the BMS group (P=0.003 by log-rank test). Angiographic stent thrombosis was 1.0% in the DES group and 0.6% in the BMS group (P=0.09).

The mechanisms involved are probably related to the pleiotropic effects of statins. Improved endothelial function, reduced low grade inflammation and decreased thrombotic diathesis might reduce cardiac injury, diffuse cardiac necrosis, myocardial infarction and no-reflow phenomenon. A decreased risk of contrast-induced nephropathy (CIN) post-PCI might be an extracardiac mechanism that contributes to the reduction in all cause and CVD mortality.

Approval by the European Medicines Agency (EMA) for its current indication is limited to patients at high risk of major blood loss undergoing isolated coronary artery bypass graft surgery (iCABG).\nOBJECTIVE: To report current real-world data on the use and certain endpoints related to the safety of aprotinin in adult patients.\nDESIGN: The Nordic aprotinin patient registry (NAPaR) received data from 83 European centres in a noninterventional, postauthorisation safety study (PASS) performed at the request of the EMA.\nSETTING: Cardiac surgical centres committed to enrolling patients in the NAPaR.\nPATIENTS: Patients receiving aprotinin agreeing to participate.\nINTERVENTION: The decision to administer aprotinin was made by the treating physicians.\nMAIN OUTCOME MEASURES: Aprotinin safety endpoints were in-hospital death, thrombo-embolic events (TEEs), specifically stroke, renal impairment, re-exploration for bleeding\/tamponade.\nRESULTS: From 2016 to 2020, 5309 patients (male 71.5%; >75 years 18.9%) were treated with aprotinin; 1363 (25.7%) underwent iCABG and 3946 (74.3%) another procedure, including a surgical treatment for aortic dissection ( n  = 660, 16.7%); 54.5% of patients received the full-dose regimen. In-hospital mortality in iCABG patients was 1.3% (95% CI, 0.66 to 1.84%) vs. 8.3% (7.21 to 8.91%) in non-iCABG patients; incidence of TEEs and postoperative rise in creatinine level greater than 44 μmol l -1 2.3% (1.48 to 3.07%) and 2.7% (1.79 to 3.49%) vs. 7.2% (6.20 to 7.79%) and 15.5% (13.84 to 16.06%); patients undergoing re-exploration for bleeding 1.4% (0.71 to 1.93%) vs. 3.0% (2.39 to 3.44%). Twelve cases of hypersensitivity\/anaphylactic reaction (0.2%) were reported as Adverse Drug Reactions.\nCONCLUSION: The data in the NApaR indicated that in this patient population, at high risk of death or blood loss undergoing cardiac surgery, including complex cardiac surgeries other than iCABG, the incidence of adverse events is in line with data from current literature, where aprotinin was not used.\nTRIAL REGISTRATION: EU PAS register number: EUPAS11384.",

Renal stenting will be performed under angiographic imaging. For patients randomised to best medical treatment the degree of stenosis measured by renal duplex sonography (RDS) will be confirmed by MR angio or multi-slice CT where possible. Best medical treatment will be initiated at randomisation or post procedure (for PTRAS arm only), and adjusted as needed at all visits. Best medical treatment is defined as optimal drug therapy for control of the major risk factors (blood pressure < or = 125\/80 mmHg, LDL cholesterol < or = 100 mg\/dL, HbA1c < or = 6.5%). Data recordings include serum creatinine values, eGFR, brain natriuretic peptide, patients' medical history and concomitant medication, clinical events, quality of life questionnaire (SF-12v2), 24 hour ambulatory blood pressure measurement, renal artery duplex ultrasound and echocardiography. Follow-up intervals are at 2, 6, 12 and 36 months following randomisation.The primary endpoint is the difference between treatments in change of eGFR over 12 months. Major secondary endpoints are technical success, change of renal function based on the eGFR slope change between pre-treatment and post-treatment (i.e. improvement, stabilisation, failure), clinical events overall such as renal or cardiac death, stroke, myocardial infarction, hospitalisation for congestive heart failure, progressive renal insufficiency (i.e. need for dialysis), need of target vessel revascularisation or target lesion revascularisation, change in average systolic and diastolic blood pressure, change in left ventricular mass index calculated from echocardiography, difference in the size of kidney (pole to pole length) measured by renal duplex sonography, total number, drug name, drug class, daily dose, regimen and Defined Daily Dose (DDD), of anti-hypertensive drugs, and change in New York Heart Association (NYHA) classification.

However, neostigmine is contraindicated in renal failure, so it is underused in ACPO patients with renal failure who would be otherwise appropriate candidates. We described the first successfully treated case of acute kidney injury (AKI) with neostigmine in a patient with ACPO. A 72-year-old man who underwent a coronary artery bypass graft surgery 11 days prior presented to the emergency room with abdominal distension, peripheral edema, and dyspnea on exertion. Plain abdominal radiographs and abdomen computed tomography scan showed diffuse colonic dilatation without obstruction. Serum creatinine level was increased five-fold over baseline. We diagnosed the patient as ACPO with AKI. With conservative treatment, renal function failed to improve because the ACPO was not corrected. Administration of neostigmine rapidly resolved ACPO and renal function, avoiding more invasive procedures such as colonoscopic decompression and hemodialysis. Neostigmine appears to be an effective and safe treatment option for ACPO patients with renal failure. Prospective large-scale studies should be carried out to determine the safety and efficacy of neostigmine in ACPO patients with renal failure.",

This study examines the impact of diabetes mellitus (DM) on the long-term outcome of patients with ESRD on chronic hemodialysis.\nMETHODS: A cohort of patients with ESRD on chronic hemodialysis, who underwent PCI with drug-eluting stents, was followed for 1 year. The clinical outcome in this population was compared retrospectively based on the presence of DM. Major adverse cardiac events (MACE) as the composite of all-cause death, Q-wave myocardial infarction and target lesion revascularization (TLR), as well as TLR as an individual outcome, were the main end points of the study.\nRESULTS: In the study cohort (n = 198), 48.5% had DM. Diabetic patients were more commonly female. The lesion characteristics were similar between groups except for more frequent saphenous vein graft intervention in nondiabetics. At 1-year follow-up there was no difference in the rate of MACE between diabetic and nondiabetic patients (40.4% vs. 39.3%, respectively, p = 0.89), driven primarily by a very high mortality rate (1-year overall mortality of 33.5%).

The risk factors for stent thrombosis are drug default, age, diabetes, renal dysfunction, left ventricular dysfunction, smoking or procedure-related factors and complications. We are describing the case of a 55-year-old non-smoker patient without the conventional risk factors for stent thrombosis maintaining good compliance with dual antiplatelet (aspirin and clopidogrel) drugs in standard doses. The patient had a history of having received a Cypher stent more than 7 years (2634 days) ago in the left circumflex artery for the management of in-stent restenosis of a bare metal stent implanted previously. He was referred with acute stent thrombosis with an atypical presentation of non-ST elevation myocardial infarction having unexplainable spontaneous resolution of electrocardiographic changes. The patient was successfully managed with newer generation drug-eluting stents reimplantation. The presence of acute onset of symptoms and thrombus containing soft lesion as documented during intervention supported the diagnosis of acute stent thrombosis.

        "Abstract":"OBJECTIVES: This study evaluated the usability and contrast volume savings of the novel DyeVert™ System.\nBACKGROUND: During coronary diagnostic and interventional procedures, a substantial portion of injected contrast does not contribute to vessel imaging due to reflux into the ascending aorta. Contrast volume is the primary physician modifiable risk factor for prevention of contrast-induced acute kidney injury CI-AKI which is a frequent complication in patients undergoing coronary angiographic procedures and is related to increases in morbidity, mortality, and healthcare costs.\nMETHODS: In this pilot trial, 44 patients undergoing coronary diagnostic and\/or percutaneous coronary intervention (PCI) procedures were enrolled in two centers. All procedures were conducted using a manual manifold injection setup and the DyeVert System, which facilitates the diversion of excess contrast volume prior to injection into the patient. Direct measurements of both the amount of contrast that was attempted to be injected and the actual volume injected into the patient were taken.\nRESULTS: The difference between the two amounts indicated the volume saved. Procedure types included 34 diagnostic studies and 10 PCI. The mean percent volume saved by the DyeVert System was 47%, with a corresponding P value of <0.0001 achieving the pre-specified level of greater than 15% of contrast media being saved. Mean volume savings were similar for both diagnostic (47 ± 9%) and PCI (50 ± 9%) procedures. Image quality was good in 43\/44 (98%) patients.\nCONCLUSIONS: The DyeVert System substantially decreases contrast delivered to patients during diagnostic or interventional coronary procedures while maintaining adequate image quality. © 2017 Wiley Periodicals, Inc.",

Drug-eluting stents (DES) might reduce the rate of target vessel revascularization in comparison with bare-metal stents (BMS) in patients with chronic kidney disease. However, given the multiple concomitant individual variables present in such patients, the comparison of neointimal growth after percutaneous coronary intervention is complex and difficult to assess.\nMETHODS AND RESULTS: Randomized Comparison of Xience V and Multi-Link Vision Coronary Stents in the Same Multivessel Patient with Chronic Kidney Disease (RENAL-DES) was a prospective, randomized, multicenter study to directly compare the efficacy in the prevention of clinical restenosis of everolimus-eluting stent (Xience V) and BMS with an identical design (Multi-Link Vision), both implanted in the same patient with multivessel coronary artery disease and chronic kidney disease (estimated glomerular filtration rate <60 mL\/min). The primary end point of the study was the ischemia-driven target vessel revascularization as detected with myocardial scintigraphy at 12 months. In 215 patients, 512 coronary vessels were successfully treated with the randomly assigned DES (n=257) or BMS (n=255). At 1 year, the rate of ischemia-driven target vessel revascularization for DES and BMS groups was 2.7% (95% confidence interval, 1.1%-5.6%) and 11.4% (95% confidence interval, 7.8% to 16%), respectively, P<0.001. For the multivariate analysis, independent predictors of the ischemia-driven target vessel revascularization were BMS implantation (odds ratio, 4.95; 95% confidence interval, 2.1-11.6; P<0.001) and vessel size (odds ratio, 0.32; 95% confidence interval, 0.1-0.7; P=0.006).\nCONCLUSIONS: This is the first randomized trial showing a reduction of clinical restenosis with a new-generation DES in comparison with a BMS of equal design, in patients who have chronic kidney disease with multivessel coronary artery disease.\nCLINICAL TRIAL REGISTRATION URL: http:\/\/clinicaltrials.gov.

We sought to determine the influence of preoperative β-blocker administration before aortic valve replacement (AVR).\nMETHODS: All patients undergoing isolated AVR from 2002 to 2016 were extracted from a multi-institutional, statewide database composed of Society of Thoracic Surgeons data. Patients were propensity score matched by preoperative and operative variables, and the effects of preoperative β-blockers on outcomes were assessed.\nRESULTS: Of 7380 eligible patients, 53% received a preoperative β-blocker. After propensity matching, a total of 4592 patients were well matched (1:1) with minimal baseline differences between groups. Within the matched cohort, the operative mortality rate (β-blocker: 2.8% vs no β-blocker: 2.4%; P = .454) and rate of major morbidity (14.4% vs 12.7%; P = .101) were similar between groups. The rates of cardiac arrest (2.1% vs 1.3%; P = .034), renal failure requiring dialysis (1.7% vs 0.9%; P = .007), and postoperative transfusion (38.2% vs 33.8%; P = .002) after AVR were significantly greater in the cohort receiving preoperative β-blockade.

        "Abstract":"INTRODUCTION: The use of transplants from extended criteria donors increases the number of urological complications after renal transplantation. Two different anastomosis techniques used to restore urinary continuity are compared in this study.\nPATIENTS AND METHODS: Retrospective study, bi-center over a period of 5 years. One hundred and seventy six patients operated at Hospices Civils de Lyon benefited from ureteroneocystostomy according to De Campos-Freire (group 1) and 167 patients operated at the Necker Hospital in Paris had a pyelo-ureterostomy (group 2). The various urological complications (fistulas, strictures, seromas, haematomas and vesico-ureteric reflux) and their care were compared. Risk factors were sought.\nRESULTS: The waiting time before transplantation was longer in group 2 than in group 1 (51 and 33.84 months) as the percentage of anuric patients (52.9 % against 32.9 %) (P<0.001). The cold ischemic time was shorter in group 1 (939.3minutes on average against 1325.3minutes for group 2) (P<0.001). A double J stent was put in place in 97.6 % of cases in group 2 against 84.2 % for group 1 (P<0.001). We did not find any significant difference in the occurrence of stenosis and fistulas (major complications) between the 2 groups. There were more minor complications (hematoma, seroma and vesico-ureteric reflux) in group 1 (P=0.033). There was a difference in the treatment of these complications, especially stenosis (P=0.024) with a significantly more conservative approach in group 2. Multivariate analysis found anuria, sex of recipients and donor age as independent risk factors in the onset of complications and the double J stent as a protective factor.\nCONCLUSION: This study does not demonstrate the superiority of a urinary anastomosis technique. The establishment of a double J stent reduces the risk of complications. Analysis of risk factors allows to propose a decision tree to guide the surgical strategy, particularly in the population of anuric recipients.\nLEVEL OF EVIDENCE: 5.",

        "Abstract":"OBJECTIVES: The aims of this study were to investigate the long-term clinical outcomes of patients with successful versus unsuccessful revascularization with drug-eluting stents (DES) for chronic total occlusion (CTO).\nBACKGROUND: The benefits of successful revascularization of CTO remain unclear.\nMETHODS: Consecutive patients (n = 333) with \"true\" CTO, defined as Thrombolysis In Myocardial Infarction (TIMI) flow grade 0 on angiography and duration ≥3 months, were divided into two groups, those with successful (CTO success group, n = 251) and unsuccessful (CTO failure group, n = 82) revascularization with DES for CTO lesions. The primary endpoint was defined as major adverse cardiac events (MACE) the composite of death, Q-wave myocardial infarction (MI), or target vessel revascularization (TVR).\nRESULTS: The CTO success group was significantly younger, with a higher involvement of LAD, and lower incidences of renal failure, previous myocardial infarction, and previous coronary intervention than the CTO failure group. After a median follow up of 1,317 days (interquartile range, 1,059-1,590 days), there were no significant between-group differences in rate of MACE, both after crude analysis (9.4% vs. 11.8%, log-rank P = 0.16) and after adjustment (HR 1.17; 95% CI 0.47-2.88, P = 0.53). On multivariate analysis, major predictors of MACE were left ventricle ejection fraction (LVEF) <40% (HR 3.14; 95% CI 1.39-7.09, P = 0.005) and multiple CTO (HR 2.38; 95% CI 1.01-5.71, P = 0.049).\nCONCLUSIONS: Long-term clinical outcomes were similar in the CTO success and failure groups. Multiple CTOs and LVEF <40% in CTO patients were independent predictors of MACE.",

        "Abstract":"BACKGROUND: Although the detrimental effects of advanced chronic kidney disease (CKD) on prognosis in coronary artery disease is known, there are few data on the efficacy and safety of modern interventional therapies and medications in patients with advanced CKD, because this special patient cohort is often excluded or underrepresented in randomized trials.\nMETHODS: In the present study all patients admitted with ST-elevation myocardial infarctions (STEMI) from the region of Bremen\/Germany treated between 2006 and 2019 were analyzed. Advanced CKD was defined as glomerular filtration rate < 45 ml\/min.\nRESULTS: Of 9605 STEMI-patients, 1018 (10.6%) had advanced CKD with a serum creatinine of 2.22 ± 4.2 mg\/dl at admission and with lower rates of primary percutaneous coronary intervention (pPCI) (84.1 vs. 94.1%, p < 0.01) and higher all-cause-mortality (44.4 vs. 3.6%, p < 0.01). Over time, advanced CKD-patients were more likely to be treated with pPCI (2015-2019: 90.3% vs. 2006-2010:75.8%, p < 0.01) and with ticagrelor\/prasugrel (59.6% vs. 1.7%, p < 0.01) and drug eluting stents (90.7% vs. 1.3%, p < 0.01). During the study period a decline in adverse ischemic events (OR 0.3, 95% CI 0.1-0.7) and an increase in bleedings (OR 2.2, 95% CI 1.3-3.8) within 1 year after the index event could be observed in patients with advanced CKD while 1-year-mortality (OR 1.0, 95% CI 0.7-1.4) and rates of acute kidney injury (OR 1.2, 95% CI 0.8-1.7) did not change in a multivariate model. Both, ticagrelor\/prasugrel (OR 0.48, 95% CI 0.2-0.98) and DES (OR 0.38, 95% CI 0.2-0.8) were associated with a decrease in ischemic events at 1 year.\nCONCLUSIONS: During the observed time period STEMI-patients with advanced CKD were more likely to be treated with primary PCI, ticagrelor or prasugrel and DE-stents. These changes probably have contributed to the decline in ischemic events and the increase in bleedings within 1 year after STEMI while overall mortality at 1-year remained unchanged for this high-risk patient group.",

N-acetylcysteine (NAC) has been shown to reduce the risk of nephropathy; however, the impact of NAC on long-term clinical outcomes has not been assessed.\nMETHODS: This randomized, double-blind, placebo-controlled trial enrolled 180 patients with moderate renal dysfunction undergoing PCI or coronary angiography with a high likelihood of ad hoc PCI; 171 patients completed the clinical follow-up. Patients received oral NAC (2000 mg\/dose, n = 95) or placebo (n = 85) twice a day for 3 doses if randomized the night prior to the procedure, and 2 doses if randomized the day of the procedure. The primary end point was the incidence of a > or =25% increase in serum creatinine level 48 to 72 hours after PCI. Secondary end points were the inhospital incidence of death, nonfatal myocardial infarction, or urgent dialysis, and the 9-month incidence of death, nonfatal myocardial infarction, need for dialysis, or repeat hospitalization for cardiac reasons.\nRESULTS: CAN occurred in 9.6% of patients assigned to NAC and 22.2% of patients assigned to placebo (P =.04); 1 patient receiving NAC required urgent dialysis. The inhospital composite end point occurred in 7 (7.4%) NAC-treated and 3 (3.5%) placebo-treated patients, P = NS. At 9 months, the composite end point occurred in 23 (24.2%) NAC-treated patients and 18 (21.2%) placebo-treated, P = NS.\nCONCLUSION: Although high-dose NAC prevented periprocedural CAN, this benefit did not translate into a decrease in adverse outcomes over 9 months.

We analyzed 209 transplanted patients: 97 in the thymoglobulin and 112 in the control group.\nRESULTS: The main complication was DGF (59.3%), with a similar incidence in both groups (63.9% vs. 55.3%; P = .36). Acute rejection episodes (ARE) were decreased with thymoglobulin (8.2% vs. 28.5%; P < .001), but cytomegalovirus viremia was 3.4-fold more frequent (58.3% vs. 17.1%; P < .001). One-year graft function was significantly better in the thymoglobulin group (59.2 ± 17.2 vs. 51.8 ± 15.3 mL\/min; P = .004), even when censored by ARE (59.7 ± 17.5 vs. 53.3 ± 14.4; P = .023). The same difference was observed at the 2-year follow-up (P = .024), even when censored for ARE (P = .045). A multivariate analysis showed thymoglobulin to be a factor strongly associated with protection of graft function (P = .039).\nCONCLUSION: Despite not reducing the incidence of DGF, thymoglobulin induction significantly reduced the incidence of ARE and showed a long-term profile of protection of renal graft function, independent of the reduction in ARE.",

        "Published":null,
        "Abstract":"UNLABELLED: Left ventricular dysfunction is common after cardiac surgery and is often treated with positive inotropic drugs (PIDs). We hypothesized that the use of PIDs after cardiac valve surgery would have significant associations with the valvular pathophysiology and surgical procedure, and unlike the case for patients undergoing coronary artery surgery, would be unrelated to duration of cardiopulmonary bypass (CPB) or of aortic clamping. One hundred forty-nine consenting patients undergoing cardiac valve surgery were studied. Patients with hepatic or renal failure, or New York Heart Association class IV cardiac symptoms, were excluded. Patients were considered to have received PIDs if they received an infusion of amrinone, dobutamine, epinephrine, or dopamine (> or = 5 microg x kg[-1] x min[-1]). PIDs were received by 78 patients (52%). In a univariate model, older age, history of congestive heart failure, decreasing left ventricular ejection fraction, longer durations of CPB, and concurrent coronary artery surgery significantly increased the likelihood of PID support. There was also significant variation by anesthesiologist in the administration of PIDs. The specific diseased valve and valvular stenosis or insufficiency did not influence the likelihood of receiving PID support. In a multivariable model, age, history of congestive heart failure, decreasing left ventricular ejection fraction, and anesthesiologist were significantly associated with the likelihood of PID support, but duration of CPB and concurrent coronary artery surgery were not. In conclusion, patient age and ventricular function, as well as physician preferences, predicted the need for inotropic drug support; however, neither the specific valvular lesion, nor duration of CPB were strongly predictive in a multivariable model.\nIMPLICATIONS: We evaluated factors related to use of positive inotropic drugs after cardiac valve surgery. The likelihood of a patient receiving these drugs increases with advancing age and with more severe preoperative left ventricular dysfunction, but was not influenced by the specific diseased valve or the duration of cardiopulmonary bypass.",

There is limited evidence regarding the relationship between CKD and patients receiving second-generation drug-eluting stents for coronary artery disease.\nOBJECTIVE: This study aimed to investigate the effect of CKD on cardiovascular and renal events in patients undergoing percutaneous coronary intervention (PCI) with everolimus-eluting stents (EES).\nMETHODS: We analyzed 504 consecutive patients with stable angina pectoris and significant coronary artery stenosis treated with EES. CKD was defined as an estimated glomerular filtration rate < 60 mL\/min\/1.73 m2 before coronary angiography. The primary outcome was the occurrence of major adverse renal and cardiovascular events (MARCE) including cardiac death, revascularization, heart failure, cerebral infarction, worsening renal function > 25% from baseline, and renal replacement therapy at 1 year.\nRESULTS: Patients were divided into the a MARCE (n = 126) and a non-MARCE (n = 378) group. The incidence of CKD was 51% in all subjects (including those on hemodialysis) and was significantly higher in the MARCE group than in the non-MARCE group (p = 0.00001). Multivariate logistic regression analysis identified that CKD was independently associated with MARCE (adjusted odds ratio 2.03, 95% confidence interval 1.21-3.39, p = 0.007). Patients were divided into four groups based on CKD and C-reactive protein (CRP) level prior to initial coronary angiography. Cox proportional hazards analysis revealed that patients with CKD and high CRP (≥0.3 mg\/dL) had the worst prognosis (hazard ratio 4.371, 95% confidence interval 2.634-7.252, p = 0.00001) compared to patients without CKD and with low CRP.\nCONCLUSION: CKD combined with CRP predicted more clinical events in patients undergoing PCI with EES.",

At 1 year, white men had significantly lower major cardiovascular events driven by lower rate of death compared with the other groups.

        "Abstract":"(1) The standard anticoagulant for preventing thromboembolic events after hip or knee replacement surgery is a subcutaneous low-molecular-weight heparin such as enoxaparin; (2) Dabigatran, a specific thrombin inhibitor, was recently licensed for oral prophylaxis in this setting, as dabigatran etexilate (mesilate), a prodrug; (3) The clinical evaluation of dabigatran in this indication is based on two comparative double-blind trials with similar protocols, comparing dabigatran 150 mg or 220 mg\/day versus enoxaparin in 3494 patients undergoing hip replacement surgery and 2101 patients undergoing knee replacement surgery. The results were virtually identical: compared with enoxaparin, dabigatran did not reduce overall mortality (almost zero in the different groups), the frequency of symptomatic pulmonary embolism (almost zero in the different groups), or the frequency of symptomatic deep venous thrombosis (0.1% to 1.2%); (4) There was no difference between the groups with respect to the frequency of severe bleeding (about 1.5%), hepatic disorders (about 4%), or acute coronary events (a few cases). But dabigatran was associated with surgical wound seepage in 7% of patients, versus 4.7% with enoxaparin; (5) The anticoagulant effect of dabigatran, and therefore the frequency of haemorrhage, increases with age and in cases of renal failure. However, clinical trials included relatively few elderly patients and\/or patients with renal failure, who nonetheless represent a large proportion of the candidates for hip or knee replacement; (6) Dabigatran becomes more potent when combined with P-glycoprotein inhibitors or with drugs that impair renal function. Combination with other antithrombotic drugs should be avoided. (7) Dabigatran is administered orally, while enoxaparin requires daily subcutaneous injections. Dabigatran therapy does not necessitate laboratory monitoring, while the platelet count must be monitored with enoxaparin.

        "Abstract":"OBJECTIVE: A pharmacodynamic interaction between clopidogrel and proton pump inhibitors (PPIs) has been suggested, leading to reduced clopidogrel-induced platelet inhibitory effects. However, data from clinical studies are conflicting. The aim of this study was to evaluate the safety of long-term clopidogrel and PPI therapy.\nMETHODS: A total of 1328 consecutive patients (age 63±11 years; 81% male) undergoing drug-eluting stent implantation and 1-year follow-up were included. All patients were treated with a standard aspirin and clopidogrel treatment regimen for 12 months. The concomitant PPI therapy for the same duration was at the discretion of the clinical cardiologist. PPI therapy included lansoprazole (30 mg\/day), pantoprazole (20 mg\/day), or omeprazole (20 mg\/day). At 1-year follow-up, major adverse cardiac events (MACE), defined as death, myocardial infarction (MI), acute coronary syndrome leading to hospitalization and nonfatal stroke, were recorded. All cause death, any stent thrombosis (ST), and bleeding (Thrombolysis in MI major and minor) were also assessed.\nRESULTS: Lansoprazole, pantoprazole, and omeprazole were administered to 855, 178, and 125 patients, whereas 170 were not prescribed any PPI therapy. Among patients treated with PPIs, those on pantoprazole had more often prior MI, multivessel coronary artery disease, and chronic kidney disease, whereas earlier peptic ulcer was more frequent among patients treated with omeprazole. The incidence of 1-year MACE was not statistically different between patients in the PPI and no-PPI groups (7.5 vs. 5.0%; P=0.26). Similarly, 1-year rates of all cause death, ST, and Thrombolysis in MI major and minor bleedings did not significantly differ. After statistical adjustment for potential confounders, the concomitant use of clopidogrel and PPIs was not associated with the risk of 1-year MACE [odds ratio (OR) 1.54, P=0.38], death (OR: 0.97, P=0.961), and ST (OR: 1.01, P=0.998). No differences across the three PPI types were found.\nCONCLUSION: The association of clopidogrel and PPIs after drug-eluting stent implantation, prescribed on clinical judgement, seems safe.",

        "Abstract":"INTRODUCTION: Sodium-glucose co-transporter-2 (SGLT-2) inhibitors have been shown to have beneficial effects on various cardiovascular (CV) outcomes in patients with type 2 diabetes (T2D) in primary prevention and in those with a high CV risk profile. However, the mechanism(s) responsible for these CV benefits remain elusive and unexplained. The aim of the DAPAHEART study will be to demonstrate that treatment with SGLT-2 inhibitors is associated with greater myocardial insulin sensitivity in patients with T2D, and to determine whether this improvement can be attributed to a decrease in whole-body (and tissue-specific) insulin resistance and to increased myocardial perfusion and\/or glucose uptake. We will also determine whether there is an appreciable degree of improvement in myocardial-wall conditions subtended by affected and non-affected coronary vessels, and if this relates to changes in left ventricular function.\nMETHODS: The DAPAHEART trial will be a phase III, single-center, randomized, two-arm, parallel-group, double-blind, placebo-controlled study. A cohort of 52 T2D patients with stable coronary artery disease (without any previous history of myocardial infarction, with or without previous percutaneous coronary intervention), with suboptimal glycemic control (glycated hemoglobin [HbA1c] 7-8.5%) on their current standard of care anti-hyperglycemic regimen, will be randomized in a 1:1 ratio to dapagliflozin or placebo. The primary outcome is to detect changes in myocardial glucose uptake from baseline to 4 weeks after treatment initiation. The main secondary outcome will be changes in myocardial blood flow, as measured by N-ammonia positron emission tomography\/computed tomography (PET\/CT). Other outcomes include cardiac function, glucose uptake in skeletal muscle, adipose tissue, liver, brain and kidney, as assessed by fluorodeoxyglucose (FDG) PET-CT imaging during hyperinsulinemic-euglycemic clamp; pericardial, subcutaneous and visceral fat, and browning as observed on CT images during FDG PET-CT studies; systemic insulin sensitivity, as assessed by hyperinsulinemic-euglycemic clamp, glycemic control, urinary glucose output; and microbiota modification.\nDISCUSSION: SGLT-2 inhibitors, in addition to their insulin-independent plasma glucose-lowering effect, are able to directly (substrate availability, fuel utilization, insulin sensitivity) as well as indirectly (cardiac after-load reduction, decreased risk factors for heart failure) affect myocardial functions. Our study will provide novel insights into how these drugs exert CV protection in a diabetic population.\nTRIAL REGISTRATION: EudraCT No. 2016-003614-27; ClinicalTrials.gov Identifier: NCT03313752.",

Furthermore, the free fraction of d-tubocurarine was unrelated to plasma concentrations of total protein, total globulin, albumin, total lipids, or alpha 1-acid glycoprotein in the four patient groups. The free fraction of d-tubocurarine (0.55 +\/- 0.02, n = 7) in solutions of HSA (0.58 mM) was similar to that observed in plasma.

The purpose of this retrospective study was to compare the incidence of renal failure and mortality in our patient population to the published rates, accounting for risk factors associated with renal failure. After IRB approval; using the STS Database and cardiopulmonary bypass pump records, a total of 2292 cardiac patients were identified from January 2004 through June 2008. Forty-nine patients were excluded because they were on renal dialysis preoperatively. There were 1226 coronary artery bypass patients. Patients were separated into groups, according to which antifibrinolytic agent was used. This study included a total of 716 patients, divided into three groups; aprotinin (n = 436), tranexamic acid (n = 61), and off-pump coronary artery bypass (OPCAB) (n = 219). Epsilon aminocaproic acid (AMICAR) was given by the anesthesiologist to the majority of the remaining 510 patients and was not recorded on the bypass record. Therefore, patients given AMICAR were not included in this study. Outcomes included renal dialysis after surgery and mortality. Risk factors were identified and compared to patients in a study published by Mangano in the New England Journal of Medicine (N Engl J Med 2006; 354: 353-365). Aprotinin vs. control group showed no significant difference in risk factors for diabetes mellitus, hypertension, creatinine level above 1.3 mg\/dl, or low ejection fraction. The percentage of patients requiring renal dialysis and mortality was less in Medical University of South Carolina (MUSC) patients than the other published study. Overall, the patients in the MUSC study had greater risk factors for renal failure, with the exception of patients with preoperative serum creatinine of >1.3 mg\/dl (8.3 vs. 15.1%). This study does not show the same risk for renal failure associated with aprotinin that has been published elsewhere.",

Those with acute coronary syndrome (ACS) are at high risk for myocardial infarction (MI) if not treated with dual antiplatelet therapy (DAPT). We sought to assess pre and post-operative outcomes of patients maintained on Clopidogrel and aspirin up to the time of surgery and compare them with those on aspirin alone.\nMETHODS: From the cardiac surgery database, 240 patients were retrospectively registered between January and May 2017. There were 126 patients with ACS who underwent CABG on DAPT (Clopidogrel group [CG]) and 114 patients who underwent elective CABG on aspirin alone (control). The CG received intraoperative prophylactic platelet transfusion (PPT). Demographics, comorbidities, and laboratory data were prospectively entered at the time of surgery and were subsequently retrieved for analysis. Per and postoperative findings were identified and compared between both groups.\nRESULTS: The cohort consisted of 240 patients (mean age 61 years, 81.3% were male, SD ± 9.58). Patients in the CG were younger (Median 57 vs. 63, P-value 0.001), and with male predominance (86% versus 75%, P-value 0.028). In addition, they had less prevalence for diabetes and renal failure as compared to control (P-values 0.003, and 0.005, respectively). There were no significant differences between both groups in number of vessels grafts, duration of on-pump and aortic clamp. Hematologic laboratory data had also similar baseline values. The CG had similar bleeding rate, redo surgery and in-hospital death (P-values non-significant), however more infection and total hospital stay as compared to control (p-values 0.048 and 0.001).\nCONCLUSION: Patients who are at increased risk for MI can be maintained on DAPT up to the time of CABG because surgery is safe when patients are offered PPT.",

N-acetylcysteine (NAC) can decrease proinflammatory cytokines and plasma homocystine as well as reduce contrast-induced nephropathy. The aim of this study, therefore, was to compare normal saline hydration with and without intravenous NAC in terms of changes in renal function, proinflammatory cytokines, inflammatory markers, and plasma total homocysteine during coronary angiography. Forty-six patients who underwent coronary angiography and\/or stent implantation for unstable angina were enrolled and assigned to NAC or NS treatment groups based on normal saline hydration with or without intravenous NAC, respectively. The NS group had lower serum creatinine (Cre: p = 0.02) and plasma total homocysteine (tHcy; p < 0.001) and increased glomerular filtration rate (GFR; p = 0.003) after angiography. In the NAC group, the serum blood urea nitrogen (BUN; p = 0.001), Cre (p < 0.001), and plasma tHcy (p < 0.001) were lower, and the GFR (P = 0.013) was increased after angiography. There were no statistically significant differences in serum high-sensitivity C reactive protein (hs-CRP), tumor necrosis factor-alpha (TNF-alpha), or interleukin-10 (IL-10) before and after angiography in the NS and NAC groups. Intergroup comparison revealed that plasma tHcy level was lower for the NAC-treated patients (p = 0.002), with lower plasma tHcy level before and after treatment in this group (p < 0.001). Normal saline hydration can improve renal function and decrease plasma tHcy after coronary angiography with or without NAC; however, the combination of the two decreases plasma tHcy more than normal saline hydration alone.",

There are few trials evaluating the efficacy of prevention strategies in renal transplant patients on major adverse cardiac events (MACE) and cardiovascular mortality.

Here, we present the case of a 52-year-old male patient who received a first kidney transplant in 1993. He showed a small fixed perfusion defect on thallium scintigraphy before transplant. He was admitted at 13 months due to an antero-lateral myocardial infarction that was complicated with ventricular fibrillation. Despite anti-coagulation with acenocumarol, treatment with statins and angiotensin II receptor blocking agents and an excellent preservation of renal function, the patient presented with a second episode of myocardial infarction at 9 years post-transplant. This case report is discussed in order to highlight the way in which attitudes have been modified in the past decade in order to systematically pursue an early diagnosis of pre-existing coronary artery disease, aggressively treat MACE and actively decrease cardiovascular risk in transplant patients, using all available efficacious treatments as well as individualizing immunosuppression to prolong not only graft but also patient survival.",

Our report is based on an analysis of 202 successive transplantations performed in our institution from May 1984 to December 1986, using low-dose CsA as the basic means of immunosuppression. A total of 142 patients received the triple combination CsA, azathioprine (AZA), and corticosteroids.

From January to December 1986, both regimens were compared in a prospective randomized trial. The factors that affect graft survival were analyzed using the Cox multivariate hazard analysis. The relative risks were calculated for pretransplant baseline risk factors and for outcome-dependent post-transplant risk factors for surviving grafts at 1 month. Transplants performed with a prolonged ischemia time and patients whose graft did not function immediately were statistically at higher risk of graft loss. Adding prophylactic ALG to CsA was associated with better graft survival. Patients who experienced more than 1 rejection crisis and patients whose 1-month CsA dose was lower than or equal to 5 mg\/kg per day were also at significantly higher risk of further graft loss.

After excluding in-hospital mortality cases (n = 79), we categorized patients into two groups based on the average SBP (SBP) at the outpatient clinic: mean SBP 120 mmHg or less (n = 290) and mean SBP greater than 120 mmHg (n = 641). Primary endpoint was major adverse cardiovascular and cerebrovascular events (MACCEs), defined as cardiac death, myocardial infarction, repeat target vessel revascularization, or stroke. Propensity score matching was performed to adjust for differences in baseline clinical variables. Median follow-up duration was 77.7 (36.6-87.3) months.\nRESULTS: The mean SBP greater than 120 mmHg had higher prevalence of cardiovascular risk factors, such as diabetes (38.4 vs. 27.2%, P = 0.001), hypertension (58.8 vs. 32.4%, P < 0.001), and chronic kidney disease (3.3 vs. 1.0%, P = 0.043) than mean SBP 120 mmHg or less.

        "Abstract":"BACKGROUND: In low-resource regions, fibrinolytic therapy is often the only option for ST-elevation myocardial infarction (STEMI) patients as primary percutaneous coronary intervention (PCI) is often not available and patients are hardly transferred to a medical center with PCI capacity within the first 120 minutes. Chronic kidney disease (CKD) is one of the most frequently encountered complications of STEMI. However, the evidence for the efficacy of fibrinolytic therapy in STEMI patients with CKD is still limited. The aim of this study is to test whether CKD modifies the association between fibrinolytic therapy and short-term major adverse cardiovascular events (MACEs) among patients with STEMI.\nMETHODS AND FINDINGS: This is a real-world study analyzing the data from 9508 STEMI patients (mean age: 64.0±12.4 years; male: 70.1%) in the third phase of Clinical Pathways in Acute Coronary Syndromes program (CPACS-3), which is a large study of the management of acute coronary syndromes (ACS) in 101 county hospitals without PCI capacity in China. CKD was defined as an estimated glomerular filtration rate of less than 60 mL\/min per 1·73 m2 at the admission. The primary outcome is short-term MACEs, including all-cause death, recurrent myocardial infarction, or nonfatal stroke. Patients were recruited consecutively between October 2011 and November 2014. Out of them, 1282 patients (13.5%) were classified as having CKD. Compared with non-CKD patients, CKD patients were less likely to receive fibrinolytic therapy than non-CKD patients (26.4% vs. 38.9%, P<0.001), more likely to experience a failed fibrinolytic therapy (32.8% vs. 16.9%), and had a higher risk of short-term MACEs (19.7% vs. 5.6%). After full adjustment, use of fibrinolytic therapy was associated with a significantly lower risk of short-term MACEs in non-CKD patients (relative risk [RR] = 0.87, 95% confidence interval [CI]: 0.76-0.99), but not in CKD patients (P for interaction = 0.026). Further analysis stratified by the success of fibrinolysis showed that compared with patients who did not receive fibrinolytic therapy, patients with successful fibrinolysis had a lower risk of short-term MACEs that was similar between patients with (RR = 0.71, 95% CI: 0.55-0.82) and without CKD (RR = 0.67, 95% CI: 0.55-0.92), while patients with unsuccessful fibrinolysis had a similarly higher risk in CKD patients (RR = 1.25, 95% CI: 1.09-1.43) and non-CKD patients (RR = 1.30, 95% CI: 1.13-1.50).\nCONCLUSIONS: CKD reduced the likelihood of successful fibrinolysis and increased the risk of short-term MACEs in patients with STEMI. Attention should be paid to how to improve the success rate of fibrinolytic therapy for STEMI patients with CKD.\nTRIAL REGISTRATION: The CPACS-3 study was registered on www.clinicaltrials.gov (NCT01398228).",

        "Abstract":"In hypertensive patients as well as in normal subjects, urapidil has a hypotensive action. This is mainly mediated by a peripheral alpha adrenoceptor blockade with a decrease in systemic vascular resistance. In addition, acute animal experiments demonstrated a centrally mediated hypotensive action, possibly by 5-hydroxytryptamine1A-receptor stimulation. Studies in humans showed an increase in cardiac output, which was not always significant; it resulted either from an increased heart rate or an increased stroke volume. Acute changes in pulmonary hemodynamics after administration of urapidil were most pronounced in patients with pulmonary hypertension: pulmonary artery pressure and pulmonary vascular resistance decreased significantly and pulmonary capillary wedge pressure decreased non-significantly. A small reduction in pulmonary artery pressure and capillary wedge pressure was seen in patients with congestive heart failure and in patients in whom acute blood pressure elevation developed after coronary bypass surgery. In patients with essential hypertension, forearm, renal and splanchnic flows were shown to increase and vascular resistance to decrease significantly after an acute intravenous doses of urapidil. The hemodynamic changes that occur during chronic therapy are largely unknown, except for systemic vascular resistance which remains decreased.",

        "Abstract":"PURPOSE: Favorable long-term outcomes of the Zilver PTX drug-eluting stent (DES) in femoropopliteal lesions have been demonstrated. Chronic renal failure (CRF) has been shown to be a risk factor for restenosis and decreased limb salvage. The results of the DES in patients with CRF have not previously been reported. This study compares the results with the DES in patients with CRF and those without CRF.\nMETHODS: This retrospective analysis from the Zilver PTX Japan Post-Market Surveillance Study included 321 patients with CRF and 584 patients without CRF. Outcomes included freedom from target lesion revascularization (TLR) and patency.\nRESULTS: Of the patients included in this subgroup analysis, 2-year data were available for 209 patients in the CRF group and 453 patients in the non-CRF group. The two groups were similar in terms of lesion length and the frequency of in-stent restenosis. Critical limb ischemia, severe calcification, and diabetes were more common in patients with CRF, whereas total occlusion was more common in patients without CRF. Freedom from TLR rates were 81.4 versus 84.9% (p = 0.24), and patency rates were 70.7 versus 70.3% (p = 0.95) in patients with and without CRF at 2 years, respectively.\nCONCLUSION: This is the first comparative study of the DES in femoropopliteal artery lesions in patients with and without CRF. These results indicate that the DES placed in femoropopliteal artery lesions of CRF patients is safe and effective with similar patency and TLR rates to patients without CRF.\nLEVEL OF EVIDENCE: Level 3, Post-Market Surveillance Study.",

        "Abstract":"BACKGROUND: The direct thrombin inhibitor bivalirudin has been found to be noninferior to heparin plus planned glycoprotein (GP) IIb\/IIIa blockade in the prevention of acute ischemic end points and 1-year mortality after percutaneous coronary intervention (PCI) with bare metal stents. We investigated whether long-term outcomes after bivalirudin use remained comparable to heparin plus GP IIb\/IIIa blockade in current clinical practice of drug-eluting stent use.\nMETHODS: Using the 2004-2005 Cornell Angioplasty Registry, we studied 2504 consecutive patients undergoing urgent or elective PCI with periprocedural use of bivalirudin or heparin plus GP IIb\/IIIa platelet inhibitors. Patients presenting with an acute ST-elevation myocardial infarction (MI) < or = 24 hours, thrombolytic therapy < or = 7 days, hemodynamic instability\/shock, or renal insufficiency were excluded.\nRESULTS: Of the study cohort, 1340 patients (54%) received bivalirudin and 1164 patients (46%) received heparin plus GP IIb\/IIIa blockade. The incidence of inhospital mortality (0.3% vs 0.2%, P = .692), MI (6.6% vs 8.1%, P = .191), and combined end point of death, stroke, emergent coronary artery bypass graft\/PCI, and MI (6.9% vs 8.3%, P = .199) was similar in the bivalirudin and heparin plus GP IIb\/IIIa inhibitor groups. There was a lower incidence of major (0.7% vs 1.9%, P = .012) and minor bleeding (9.6% vs 15.6%, P < .001) in the bivalirudin versus heparin plus GP IIb\/IIIa inhibitor group. Mean clinical follow-up was 24.8 +\/- 7.7 months. At follow-up, there were 87 (6.5%) deaths in the bivalirudin group versus 42 (3.6%) in the heparin plus GP IIb\/IIIa inhibitor group (hazard ratio 1.87, 95% CI 1.30-2.71, P = .001). After a propensity score adjusted multivariate Cox analysis, bivalirudin use was associated with a nonsignificant trend toward increased long-term mortality (hazard ratio 1.45, 95% CI 0.98-2.16, P = .065).\nCONCLUSIONS: Compared with heparin plus GP IIb\/IIIa inhibition, routine use of bivalirudin as the procedural anticoagulant in contemporary PCI with drug-eluting stents was associated with lower rates of inhospital complications and similar long-term all-cause mortality.",

On one hand, drug-eluting stents (DES) have emerged as a solution to the problem of restenosis after balloon angioplasty or bare-metal stent implantation, which was responsible for a higher rate of events (mainly repeat revascularization) in relation to CABG. On the other hand, off-pump bypass techniques and minimally invasive grafting of the left anterior descending artery appear to be safe and efficacious alternatives to traditional, on-pump CABG. Available literature includes studies outdated by current technologies, leaving the dilemma of best revascularization strategy unanswered in the general CAD population, but also in high-risk groups, such as diabetics and patients with chronic kidney disease. A number of ongoing trials, especially designed for this purpose, are set to end the debate, providing headto- head comparisons between DES-assisted PCI and contemporary bypass surgery.",

        "Abstract":"BACKGROUND: A therapeutic dilemma exists when patients with symptomatic carotid stenosis and concomitant heparin-induced thrombocytopenia (HIT) are advised to urgently undergo carotid endarterectomy (CEA) with heparin therapy.\nMETHODS: After a 63-year-old man with HIT and multiple medical comorbidities underwent emergent coronary artery bypass grafting, postoperative imaging revealed plaque at the origin of the left internal carotid artery with 80%-99% stenosis and minimal contralateral internal carotid artery disease. During the patient's evaluation to undergo CEA for symptomatic high-grade carotid stenosis, enzyme-linked immunosorbent assay revealed persistent platelet factor 4 antibodies.\nRESULTS: The endarterectomy was successfully performed while the patient received argatroban, both as a continuous infusion and intermittent irrigation during dissection of the plaque. Postoperatively, the drip was continued for 24 hours, and the patient was discharged day 2 on a daily dose of 325 mg of aspirin. At the 6-month examination, Doppler ultrasound revealed normal anterograde velocities with no evidence of stenosis, and the patient noted no subsequent ischemic events.\nCONCLUSIONS: We now recommend systemic intravenous and local argatroban irrigation to prevent thromboembolic complications in CEA cases with HIT and renal insufficiency. Bivalirudin for both systemic intravenous use and local irrigation may be safer in patients without renal insufficiency because of its shorter half-life.",

Neither pupil reacted to light stimulus. Funduscopic findings revealed a slightly pale optic disc and renal retinopathy with macular folds in both eyes. No other neuro-ophthalmologic or neurologic abnormalities were observed. Based on these findings, the patient was diagnosed as having bilateral posterior ischemic optic neuropathy and was treated with intravenous corticosteroids. From about 50 days after the operation, visual acuity gradually improved, and papillary light reaction was immediate. In cranial magnetic resonance imaging, no characteristic lesions of multiple sclerosis could be detected. Six months later, visual acuity improved to 20\/20 in both eyes.\nCONCLUSION: In patients with renal failure and underlying systemic vascular disease and anemia, the risk of posterior ischemic optic neuropathy should be considered even in minor surgery with stable vital signs and without severe blood loss.",

We applied three cycles of lower limb tourniquet, inflated its cuff for 5 minutes in study group or left un-inflated (sham or control group) before the procedure. The primary outcome was serum creatinine, creatinine clearance and troponin-I Levels at time 0, 6, 12, 24 and 48 h. Secondary outcomes were serum C-reactive protein, inotrope score, ventilation time and ICU stay. Data's were analyzed by MedCalc (MedCalc Software bvba, Acacialaan, Belgium). We compared the two group by student t test, chi-square and Mann-Whitney tests.\nRESULTS: The two groups were not statistically different in terms of age, gender, smoking habits, drug use, hypertension, hyperlipidemia and diabetes mellitus. This study showed a higher CRP level in study group comparing with control group (P=0.003), creatinine clearance was slightly higher in study group specially 24 h after procedure but was not statistically significant (p=0.11). Troponin-I level was significantly lower in study group (p=0.001).\nCONCLUSION: This study showed a lower Troponin-I level in study group which suggest a cardio-myocyte protective function of RIPC. It also showed slightly lower Creatinine clearance in control group, gap between two group increases significantly 24 hours after procedure which may suggest a potential kidney protection by RIPC.

Polymerase chain reaction was carried out to measure transforming growth factor beta (TGF-beta), hypoxia induced factor (HIF), signal transducing activator 3 and vascular endothelial growth factor.\nRESULTS: Ten-day survival in rats undergoing 90% hepatectomy significantly increased in i.p.-pretreated animals. After 70% hepatectomy the mitotic index was significantly increased in both rHuEPO-treated groups. These data were confirmed by PCNA and Ki-67 expression, which was significantly increased in the treated groups 24 h and 2 days after liver resection. TGF-beta and HIF mRNA both were upregulated in control animals 3 h after surgery.\nCONCLUSION: rHuEPO effectively increased liver regeneration in rats after 70% liver resection and enhanced survival after 90% hepatectomy. Thus, rHuEPO may increase the regenerative capacity after major hepatectomy.",

We followed 1,145 individuals in the Pharmacogenomic Resource to improve Medication Effectiveness Genotype Guided Antiplatelet Therapy cohort for MACE and bleeding events following PCI for ACS. We constructed Cox proportional hazards models to compare MACE and bleeding in those with versus without HF, adjusting for sociodemographics, comorbidities, and medications. We also determined predictors of MACE and bleeding events in both groups. 370 (32%) individuals did and 775 (68%) did not have HF prior to PCI. Mean age was 61.7 ± 12.2 years, 31% were female, and 24% were African American. After a median follow-up of 0.78 years, individuals with HF had higher rates of MACE compared to those without HF (48 vs. 24 events per 100 person years) which remained significant after multivariable adjustment (hazard ratio [HR] 1.31, 95% confidence interval [CI] 1.00 to 1.72). Similarly, bleeding was higher in those with versus without HF (22 vs. 11 events per 100 person years), although this was no longer statistically significant after multivariable adjustment (HR 1.29, 95% CI 0.86 to 1.93). Diabetes and peripheral vascular disease were predictors of MACE, and end-stage renal disease was a predictor of bleeding among participants with HF. MACE risk is higher in individuals with versus without HF following PCI for ACS. However, the risk of bleeding, especially among those with end-stage renal disease , must be considered when determining post-PCI anticoagulant strategies.",

We sought to investigate the differential prognostic impact of angiographic CR over incomplete revascularization (IR), according to the presence of CKD in the drug-eluting stent era.\nMETHODS AND RESULTS: Between 2003 and 2011 at Samsung Medical Center, consecutive patients with multivessel disease were stratified by the presence of CKD (estimated glomerular filtration rate <60 mL\/min per 1.73 m) and classified according to angiographic CR (residual SYNTAX score=0) or IR. Clinical outcomes were compared between angiographic CR and IR, stratified by the presence of CKD.

Intravenous therapy with platelet glycoprotein (GP) IIb\/IIIa receptor antagonists improves outcome in patients with acute coronary syndromes (ACS). Whether potent long-term antiplatelet therapy with oral GP IIb\/IIIa antagonists will further improve outcome at a dose that is tolerable in long-term treatment is unknown.\nTRIAL DESIGN: SYMPHONY (Sibrafiban versus aspirin to Yield Maximum Protection from ischemic Heart events post-acute cOroNary syndromes) was a randomized, double-blind, aspirin-controlled trial with 2 concentration regimens of sibrafiban, an oral peptidomimetic GP IIb\/IIIa antagonist, for long-term treatment instead of aspirin in patients after an ACS. Patients were eligible for SYMPHONY if they presented within 7 days of an ACS (>\/=20 minutes of ischemic symptoms), had been clinically stable for at least 12 hours, and met one of the following inclusion criteria: ST-segment depression or elevation of at least 0.5 mm or new left bundle branch block with the ACS or elevated creatinine kinase MB more than the upper limit of normal and >3% of total creatine kinase or, if creatine kinase MB was not measured, an elevated level of troponin T or I. Approximately 9000 patients post ACS were randomized 1:1:1 to treatment with either aspirin (80 mg every 12 hours) or high-dose or low-dose sibrafiban every 12 hours. Assignment of tablet strength (3, 4.5, or 6 mg) within the sibrafiban arms was based on body weight and renal function to achieve a target steady-state plasma concentration. The duration of study drug therapy was 90 days. Patients who had intracoronary stenting during the course of the study initially received a blinded stent medication assignment for 2 to 4 weeks based on their initial randomization as follows: aspirin\/ticlopidine 250 mg twice daily, low-dose sibrafiban\/ticlopidine placebo twice daily, and high-dose sibrafiban\/ticlopidine placebo twice daily. After the second interim safety assessment by the Data and Safety Monitoring Board the stent regimen for the low-dose group was modified to include ticlopidine 250 mg twice daily.\nEND POINTS: The primary efficacy end point of SYMPHONY was the 90-day incidence of a composite of all-cause mortality, myocardial infarction or reinfarction, and severe recurrent ischemia. A clinical events classification committee was established to determine the end points of reinfarction and severe recurrent ischemia. The primary safety end points were the incidence of major bleeding or minor bleeding and the combined incidence of major and minor bleeding. Bleeding classification was done by computer algorithm. Tolerability was assessed by the rate of study drug discontinuation from bleeding.",

CA-AKI was defined as a post-PCI increase in serum creatinine of >0.5 mg\/dL or a relative increase of ≥25% compared with pre-PCI. CKD was defined as estimated glomerular filtration rate <60 mL\/min\/1.73 m. The primary endpoint was the 2-year rate of net adverse clinical events (NACE): All-cause mortality, myocardial infarction (MI), definite or probable stent thrombosis, or major bleeding.\nRESULTS: Of 7287 (85%) patients with evaluable data, 476 (6.5%) developed CA-AKI. In a multivariable model, older age, female sex, Caucasian race, congestive heart failure, diabetes, hypertension, CKD, presentation with ST-segment elevation MI, Killip class II to IV, radial access, intra-aortic balloon pump use, hypotension, and number of stents were independent predictors of CA-AKI. The 2-year NACE rate was higher in patients with CA-AKI (adjusted HR: 1.88; 95% CI: 1.42-2.49), as was each component of NACE (all-cause mortality, HR: 1.77; 95% CI: 1.22-2.55; MI, HR: 1.67; 95% CI: 1.18-2.36; definite\/probable stent thrombosis, HR: 1.71; 95% CI: 1.10-2.65; and major bleeding, HR: 1.38; 95% CI: 1.06-1.80).

Hyperglycaemia is a major, potentially modifiable risk factor of adverse outcome after cardiac surgery known to aggravate organ damage. The aim of this study was to address the association between intraoperative glucose concentration and postoperative AKI in patients who underwent OPCAB.\nMETHODS: The medical records of 880 consecutive patients were retrospectively reviewed. Patients were divided into three groups according to the time-weighted average of intraoperative glucose concentrations (<110, 110-150 and >150 mg\/dl), and the incidence of AKI (increase of serum creatinine to >2.0 mg\/dl and 2 × most recent preoperative value or a new requirement for dialysis) was compared. Multivariate logistic regression analysis was performed to identify independent risk factors for postoperative AKI.\nRESULTS: The incidence of AKI was higher in patients with a glucose level >150 mg\/dl than in patients with a glucose level = 110-150 mg\/dl [8% (20 of 251) vs 3% (14 of 453), P = 0.004].

        "Published":null,
        "Abstract":"Since 2001 independent Organ Donor Facilities(OFOs) have been proposed within Organ Procurement Organizations (OPOs) with the aim of reducing organ procurement costs 1, cold ischemia time of donor organs and the flight-related risk 2 for donor surgeons, perfusionists and coordinators. An independent OFO has been established in 2001 in St. Louis 3, half away between the 2 Transplant Centers (TCs) (Washington University School of Medicine and St. Louis University) and now includes a two-bed intensive care facility, a complete laboratory, a cardiac catheterization facility, a Computed Tomography (CT) scanner and an operating room. All brain-dead (BD) patients within OPO (Mid-America Transplant Services), after family's informed consent, are transferred, if necessary by an OPO owned and operated airplane, to this facility, where undergo multiorgan harvesting. By doing so the organ acquisition charges (OACs) apparently decreased, as well as delay in recovery, which can affect organ viability and move families to withdraw consent; also risks and tiring of transplant surgeons were reduced. This independent OFO successfully procured in 2001 not only livers, but also pancreas, kidneys, hearts and lungs 4-6. Cold ischemia time was reduced and there was no Primary Non Function (PNF) of harvested organs, but only kidney delayed graft function (DGF). In the past, heart donors were moved to the recipient's hospital. With the development of multiorgan harvesting, usually donor surgeons are sent by the TCs in order to evaluate liver, pancreas, heart and lungs, while the only local surgeons is the \"nephrectomist\", that in local hospital is not a transplant surgeon. To move a donor, although hemodinamically stable, is always a risk. Finally, the decrease of OAC must balance the extra expenses to create and operate independent OFOs. In all the papers published by the members of this OFO, the control group of the retrospective analysis consisted of less selected BD donors, requiring more vasosuppressor support, which can be a study bias. It has been proposed that OPOs should organize \"recovery teams\" for multiple TCs but most transplant surgeons, in case of marginal donors, would like to inspect the organ prior to starting recipient surgery or would send their own team to harvest organs. According to literature, there are no other independent OFOs in US, probably because there is no need for them, and increasing their numbers would not increase organ donation rate. Considering Europe, we do not have information about the existence of independent OFOs: this may be a consequence of logistical organization and minor distances, as well as the higher concentration of TCs. However, the acceptance of such a procedure from donors' families may be less enthusiastic in Europe than in USA, particularly from minorities. In Italy would not be acceptable that the maintenance of BD donors and more generally the operation of independent OFO would rely on non-physicians, to save costs. Finally it is not clear from the reviewed papers who pay for transportation of the donor's body from the independent OFO back to home, but donor's family should not be charged for these expenses. At least 5 donors were lost during transportation, confirming that moving of BD donors remains a risky procedure. The potential economical and organizative benefits of independent OFOs could be counterweighted by the perceived (by relatives and public opinion) commodification\/ reification of BD patients. Anyway, the authors of these papers should be congratulated for their innovative proposal. However, a prospective randomized trial would be needed to draw more definitive conclusions on the real benefits of independent OFOs.",

Patients were randomly assigned to 3 groups; Group I; 38 pts. 6.5 mln KIU aprotynin. Group II; placebo--30 pts. Group III; 23 pts. 2 mln. KIU. There were 4 measurements 1.--before operation, 2. after discontinuing CPB, 3.--6 h after operation, 4.--24 h after operation. We measured Hb, Ht, PLT Glucose, D-dimers, APTT, TT Fibrynogen, INR, AT3, Ca2+, factor V, VIII, GOT GPT CK, CK-MB, CRP, ACT concentration of Hb in drainage 6 h after operation. There were estimated: renal function profile, drainage loss, perioperative MI, mortality, reoperation rate due to bleeding.\nRESULTS: The level of blood count and coagulation parameters did not differ between the groups in any test periods. D-dimer levels were significantly higher in the placebo group than in group I and III. The decrease of fibrin degradation was not related to the dose of aprotynin. Drainage was insignificantly higher in placebo group. Renal function was impaired in neither group. Reoperation rate perioperative infarction and mortality did not differ between the groups, however was highest in group I.\nCONCLUSION: Aprotynin reduces blood loss after operation in CPB and decrease fibrin degradation independently to the dose of the drug. The high-dose of aprotynin may increase the risk of early graft occlusion in patients without coagulation disorders.",

Patients with AKI had significantly increased in-hospital mortality than patients without AKI. Multivariate logistic regression analysis showed that decreased baseline eGFR, increased fasting plasma glucose (FPG), use of diuretics and Killip grade IV were independent risk factors of AKI, while increased DBP on admission was a protective factor for patients in conservative treatment group. Decreased baseline eGFR, increased FPG, use of diuretics, intraoperative hypotension and acute infection were independent risk factors of AKI for patients in the CAG group. Decreased baseline eGFR, increased FPG, use of diuretics and low cardiac output syndrome after operation were independent risk factors of AKI for patients in the CABG group.\nCONCLUSIONS: AKI is a common complication and associated with increased mortality after AMI. Decreased baseline renal function, increased FPG and use of diuretics were common independent risk factors of AKI after AMI.",

        "Abstract":"AIMS: Chronic kidney disease (CKD) is associated with worse outcomes in patients with coronary artery disease (CAD). How CKD influences the benefit-risk balance of drug-eluting stents (DES) versus bare-metal stents (BMS) is less known.\nMETHODS AND RESULTS: In the multicentre BASKET-PROVE trial, 2314 patients in need of large coronary stenting (≥ 3.0mm) were randomised 2:1 to DES or BMS. In an a priori planned secondary analysis, outcomes were evaluated according to renal function defined by estimated glomerular filtration rates (eGFR; normal: eGFR ≥ 60 ml\/min\/1.73 m(2); CKD: eGFR<60 ml\/min\/1.73 m(2)). The primary endpoint was the first major adverse cardiac event (MACE: cardiac death, myocardial infarction, target vessel revascularisation) up to 2 years. A Cox proportional-hazard model was used to evaluate adjusted relative risks (hazard rates, HRs) for BMS versus DES. The interaction of stent type and renal function was tested. CKD patients (189 (11.2%)\/1681 with such data) had a 2-year MACE rate of 8.5% versus 7.4% in those without CKD [HR 0.98 (0.56-1.72), p=0.95] with cardiac mortalities of 5.3% and 1.5%, respectively (p=0.002, non-significant after baseline adjustments). The MACE rate was lower in CKD patients with DES than with BMS [4.9% versus 15.2%, p=0.017, HR 0.29(0.10-0.80)] as was the MACE rate in patients without CKD [5.6% with DES versus 11.1% with BMS, p<0.0001, HR 0.51(0.35-0.75)]. No significant interaction between stent type and renal function was found.\nCONCLUSIONS: This analysis of patients needing large coronary artery stenting confirms the increased mortality of CKD patients and documents a long-term benefit of DES compared to BMS irrespective of kidney function.",

        "Abstract":"BACKGROUND: Triflusal is an irreversible inhibitor of platelet cyclooxygenase. Triflusal significantly reduced the incidence of nonfatal myocardial infarction in patients with unstable angina. Antithrombotic properties have also been demonstrated in patients with aortocoronary vein grafting, coronary angioplasty, peripheral arteriopathy and cerebrovascular disease. Moreover, in diabetic patients it has a protective effect against retinal microangiopathy, improves renal flow and reduces proteinuria. The drug has a high tolerability and has low incidence of side effects, with prevalence of gastrointestinal and skin disorders. Because of its demonstrated effectiveness and its good handling, we decided to use Triflusal in treatment of geriatric patients with peripheral arteriopathy. Often these patients have a diffused arteriopathic disease which can be associated with chronic diseases. For this reason there are severe problems of compliance due to contemporary administration of several drugs; so the utilization of effective drugs, without side effects, promotes a safer clinical management of patients.\nMETHODS: Between April 2000 and March 2001, we treated with Triflusal 70 patients, over 65 years old, with peripheral arteriopathy. The group comprises patients who had undergone traditional vascular surgery, or endovascular surgery and patients treated exclusively with drug therapy. During the follow-up we obser-ved the possible clinical development of side effects of the drug reported in the literature (nausea, vomiting, etc.).\nRESULTS: One patient, already affected by gastroduodenal disease, suspended the therapy because of severe epigastric burning.\nCONCLUSIONS: The follow-up of the patients goes on in order to evaluate the tolerability and handling of Triflusal, observing a larger number of patients.",

        "Abstract":"The study of efficacy and safety of the drug vitaprost plus (rectal suppositories) in its use for prevention of infectious-inflammatory complications after transurethral resection (TUR) of the prostate for adenoma included 55 male surgical patients with prostatic adenoma (PA). The patients were randomized into two groups matched by age, symptoms and clinical data. The control group consisted of 20 patients (group 1), the study group--of 35 patients (group 2). TUR of the prostate was made in both groups, but patients of group 2 were given additional prophylactic treatment--vitaprost plus, one suppository before going to bed 2 days before surgery and for 8 days after TUR, the course lasted for 10 days. Postoperative blood and urine samples showed inflammatory changes more often in group 1, free of infection bacterial tests were more often in group 2. Renal microcirculation in group 1 after TUR evidenced for functional depression on perfusion intensity and renal ischemia and congestion. These changes persisted on postoperative day 8, being a potential cause of renal inflammation and ascending pyelonephritis. Group 2 patients exhibited insignificant postoperative microcirculatory disorders in the kidneys and were not registered on postoperative day 8. Infectious-inflammatory complications in group 1 patients were registered much more frequently than in group 2 patients. Thus, vitaprost plus can be recommended for prophylaxis of infectious-inflammatory complications of TUR in PA patients.",

        "Abstract":"BACKGROUND: We compared efficacy and safety of short- (3 or 6 months) versus long-term (≥12 months) dual antiplatelet therapy (DAPT) after drug-eluting stent (DES) implantation, according to the presence of chronic kidney disease (CKD).\nMETHODS: Patient-level pooled analysis was performed with 7242 patients (87.2% with 2nd generation DES) from 5 randomized controlled trials.\nRESULTS: In both CKD (1273 patients) and non-CKD (5969 patients) population, the rates of patient-oriented composite outcomes at 1-year (POCO, all-cause death, any myocardial infarction [MI], stroke and TIMI major bleeding) were not different between the short- and long-term DAPT (hazard ratio [HR] 1.19, 95% confidence interval [CI] 0.76-1.86, P=.449 in CKD population; HR 1.14, 95% CI 0.83-1.56, P=.434 in non-CKD population). The rates of coronary thrombotic events (any MI and definite\/probable stent thrombosis) also did not differ between short- and long-term DAPT in either CKD or non-CKD population. As for bleeding events, long-term DAPT increased the TIMI major bleeding (HR 2.91, 95% CI 1.31-6.48, P=.009) in non-CKD population. The similar trend was observed with long-term DAPT in CKD population. But it did not reach statistical significance (HR 3.15, 95% CI 0.64-15.63, P=.160).\nCONCLUSIONS: The rates of POCO and coronary thrombotic events were significantly higher in patients with CKD compared with those without CKD, which were not affected by short- or long-term DAPT. Higher bleeding incidence by long-term DAPT was only observed in non-CKD patients but not in CKD patients. Further large scale studies are warranted to confirm our findings.",

        "Abstract":"CONTEXT: Renal dysfunction is a complication of coronary artery bypass graft (CABG) surgery performed with cardiopulmonary bypass (CPB) that is associated with increased morbidity and mortality. N-acetylcysteine, an antioxidant and vasodilator, counteracts renal ischemia and hypoxia.\nOBJECTIVE: To determine whether perioperative intravenous (IV) N-acetylcysteine preserves renal function in high-risk patients undergoing CABG surgery with CPB compared with placebo.\nDESIGN, SETTING, AND PATIENTS: Randomized, quadruple blind, placebo-controlled trial (October 2003-September 2004) in operating rooms and general intensive care units (ICUs) of 2 Ontario tertiary care centers. The 295 patients required elective or urgent CABG and had at least 1 of the following: preexisting renal dysfunction, at least 70 years old, diabetes mellitus, impaired left ventricular function, or undergoing concomitant valve or redo surgery.\nINTERVENTIONS: Patients received 4 (2 intraoperative and 2 postoperative) doses of IV N-acetylcysteine (600 mg) (n = 148) or placebo (n = 147) over 24 hours.\nMAIN OUTCOME MEASURES: The primary outcome was the proportion of patients developing postoperative renal dysfunction, defined by an increase in serum creatinine level greater than 0.5 mg\/dL (44 micromol\/L) or a 25% increase from baseline within the first 5 postoperative days. Secondary outcomes included postoperative interventions and complications, the requirement for renal replacement therapy (RRT), adverse events, hospital mortality, and ICU and hospital length of stay.\nRESULTS: There was no difference in the proportion of patients with postoperative renal dysfunction (29.7% vs 29.0%, P = .89; relative risk [RR], 1.03 [95% confidence interval {CI}, 0.72-1.46]) in the N-acetylcysteine and placebo groups, respectively. We noted nonsignificant differences in postoperative interventions and complications, the need for RRT (0.7% vs 2.1%; P = .37), total (6.1% vs 9.6%; P = .26) and serious adverse events, hospital mortality (3.4% vs 2.7%; P>.99), and ICU and hospital length of stay between the N-acetylcysteine and placebo groups. A post hoc subgroup analysis of patients (baseline creatinine level >1.4 mg\/dL [120 micromol\/L]) showed a nonsignificant trend toward fewer patients experiencing postoperative renal dysfunction in the N-acetylcysteine group compared with the placebo group (25.0% vs 37.1%; P = .29).\nCONCLUSIONS: N-acetylcysteine did not prevent postoperative renal dysfunction, interventions, complications, or mortality in high-risk patients undergoing CABG surgery with CPB. Further research is required to identify CABG patients at risk for postoperative renal events, valid markers of renal dysfunction, and to establish renal thresholds associated with important clinical outcomes.",
