The primary study endpoint was a composite of a persistent decline of more than 30% in eGFR or ESRD.\nRESULTS: 23.1% of patients had COVID-19 during a follow-up period of 2.5 y (0.8-2.6), while 17.6% of patients reached the composite endpoint. Those with COVID-19 were more likely to reach the composite endpoint [26.7% vs. 14.8%; OR, 2.1 (95%CI, 1.23-3.58), p = 0.006). There was a significant eGFR change in the first year of follow-up between the two study groups [-2.24 (95%CI,-4.86; 0.37) vs. +2.31 (95%CI, 0.78; 3.85) ml\/min, p = 0.004], with an adjusted mean difference of -4.68 ml\/min (95%CI,-7.7; -1.59)(p = 0.03). The trend for worse renal outcomes remained consistent in patients with IgAN, MN and FSGS, but not in those with LN. After multivariate adjustment, the independent predictors of the composite endpoint were baseline eGFR (HR, 0.94; 95%CI, 0.92-0.95), COVID-19 (HR, 1.91; 1.16-3.12) and male gender (HR, 1.64; 95%CI, 1.01-2.66). In multivariate linear regression analysis, COVID-19 independently determined a reduction of eGFR at 12 months by 4.62 ml\/min\/1.73m2 (β coefficient, -4.62; 95%CI, -7.74 to -1.5, p = 0.004).\nCONCLUSIONS: There is a significant impact of COVID-19 on long-term renal function in patients with biopsy-proven kidney diseases, leading to a greater decline of eGFR and a worse renal survival.",

Renal outcome defined as End-Stage Renal Disease (ESRD). To compare the predictive ability of different REE estimation equations on ESRD. Patients' REE was assessed according to the estimating equation with the best predictive power, and then the relationship between REE and ESRD risk was fitted using a restricted cubic spline curve (RCS) plot and REE cutoff values were obtained. Grouping using cutoff values, and ultimately evaluate the relationship between REE and the risk of ESRD using a Multivariate Cox regression model.\nRESULTS: The strongest predictive validity for renal outcomes was the NDCKD-equation. The patients were divided into the higher-REE group ( = 78) and the lower-REE group ( = 46), based on the cutoff value. During the follow-up, 30 of 124 patients (24.2%) proceeded to ESRD.

        "Abstract":"INTRODUCTION: Acute kidney injury (AKI) in cancer patients receiving immune checkpoint inhibitors (ICIs) may recognize multiple causes. Here, we reviewed cases of biopsy-proven acute tubulointerstitial nephritis (ATIN) to describe the clinical characteristics and outcomes of this condition.\nMETHOD: We conducted a pooled analysis of clinical cases of ICI-related biopsy-proven ATIN up to 1 May 2022. We collected data on clinical characteristics, AKI, biopsy findings, laboratory examinations, and renal outcomes.\nRESULTS: Eighty-five patients (61.4 ± 19 years, 56 male) were evaluated. Melanoma was the most prevalent diagnosis (51%), followed by non-small cell lung cancer (30%). ICI treatment consisted of PD-1, PDL-1 (nivolumab, pembrolizumab, atezolizumab), and CTLA-4 inhibitors (i) (ipilimumab) or combination PD-1i+CTLA4i. Renal toxicity developed after a median of four cycles of therapy. Fifty-one patients (65.5%) developed the most severe form of AKI- stage 3, including five patients requiring dialysis. All the 19 patients treated with dual ICI blockade developed AKI-stage 3, compared with 29 patients out of the 60 receiving a single agent (p<0.001). Most events were managed with corticosteroids associated with ICI withdrawal. In 15 patients ICI was restarted, but in six (40%) AKI recurred. Overall, 32 patients (40%) presented a complete renal recovery, which chance was inversely associated with dual ICI blockade (OR 0.15, 95CI 0.03-0.7, p=0.01).\nCONCLUSION: ICI-related ATIN may develop late after the therapy initiation, presenting as severe AKI, particularly in patients with dual ICI blockade. Although this complication may be partially reversible, concerns remain about the renal function sequelae and the possibility of restarting ICI treatment.",

        "Abstract":"A 54-year-old woman on dialysis due to chronic renal failure had a fever lasting 2 weeks and was referred to a hospital. Non-enhanced CT and blood tests showed no remarkable findings. She was hospitalized and received an antibacterial drug. Although she was discharged after the fever subsided, she was hospitalized again due to a fever a few days later. A contrast-enhanced CT revealed mediastinal lymphadenopathy, and she was transferred to our hospital for a bronchoscopy. Endobronchial Ultrasound-Guided Transbronchial Needle Aspiration (EBUS-TBNA) for subcarinal lymph nodes was performed in our hospital. The Polymerase Chain Reaction (PCR) test of the obtained specimen was positive for mycobacterium tuberculosis, and histologically, caseous granulomas were found in the specimen. She was diagnosed with mediastinal tuberculous lymphadenitis, and HREZ (isoniazid, rifampicin, ethambutol, and pyrazinamide) treatment was started. The fever subsided immediately, and she was discharged from our hospital 2 weeks after the initiation of treatment. Thereafter, she received treatment as an outpatient. Since the use of a contrast medium was complicated by dialysis, a non-enhanced CT was performed at first, and it was difficult to make a diagnosis from this. We report this as an informative case that could be diagnosed with EBUS-TBNA, which was easily performed on a patient weakened by prolonged fever and dialysis.",

        "Abstract":"Many studies have reported that protocol biopsy (PB) may help preserve kidney function in kidney transplant recipients. Early detection and treatment of subclinical rejection may reduce the incidence of chronic antibody-mediated rejection and graft failure. However, no consensus has been reached regarding PB effectiveness, timing, and policy. This study aimed to evaluate the protective role of routine PB performed 2 weeks and 1 year after kidney transplantation. We reviewed 854 kidney transplant recipients at the Samsung Medical Center between July 2007 and August 2017, with PBs planned at 2 weeks and 1 year after transplantation. We compared the trends in graft function, chronic kidney disease (CKD) progression, new-onset CKD, infection, and patient and graft survival between the 504 patients who underwent PB and 350 who did not undergo PB. The PB group was again divided into 2 groups: the single PB group (n = 207) and the double PB group (n = 297). The PB group was significantly different from the no-PB group in terms of the trends in graft function (estimated glomerular filtration rate). The Kaplan-Meier curve showed that PB did not significantly improve graft or overall patient survival. However, in the multivariate Cox analysis, the double PB group had advantages in graft survival, CKD progression, and new-onset CKD. PB can play a protective role in the maintenance of kidney grafts in kidney transplant recipients.",

        "Abstract":"BACKGROUND: Oxaliplatin is an anticancer therapy for pancreatic, gastric, and colorectal cancers. It is also used in patients with carcinomas of unknown primary sites. Oxaliplatin is associated with less frequent renal dysfunction than other conventional platinum-based drugs such as cisplatin. Albeit, there have been several reports of acute kidney injury with frequent use. In all cases, renal dysfunction was temporary and did not require maintenance dialysis. There have been no previous reports of irreversible renal dysfunction after a single dose of oxaliplatin.\nCASE PRESENTATION: Previous reports of oxaliplatin-induced renal injury occurred after patients received multiples doses. In this study, a 75-year-old male with unknown primary cancer and underlying chronic kidney disease developed acute renal failure after receiving the first dose of oxaliplatin. Suspected of having drug-induced renal failure through an immunological mechanism, the patient was treated with steroids; however, treatment was ineffective. Renal biopsy ruled out interstitial nephritis and revealed acute tubular necrosis. Renal failure was irreversible, and the patient subsequently required maintenance hemodialysis.\nCONCLUSIONS: We provide the first report of pathology-confirmed acute tubular necrosis after the first dose of oxaliplatin which led to irreversible renal dysfunction and maintenance dialysis.",

It is unknown how women with CKD understand their pregnancy risk. This nine-centre, cross-sectional study aimed to explore how women with CKD perceive their pregnancy risk and its impact on pregnancy intention, and identify associations between biopsychosocial factors and perception of pregnancy risk and intention.\nMETHODS: Women with CKD in the UK completed an online survey measuring their pregnancy preferences; perceived CKD severity; perception of pregnancy risk; pregnancy intention; distress; social support; illness perceptions and quality of life. Clinical data were extracted from local databases. Multivariable regression analyses were performed. Trial registration: NCT04370769.\nRESULTS: Three hundred fifteen women participated, with a median estimated glomerular filtration rate (eGFR) of 64 ml\/min\/1.73m(IQR 56). Pregnancy was important or very important in 234 (74%) women. Only 108 (34%) had attended pre-pregnancy counselling. After adjustment, there was no association between clinical characteristics and women's perceived pregnancy risk nor pregnancy intention. Women's perceived severity of their CKD and attending pre-pregnancy counselling were independent predictors of perceived pregnancy risk. Importance of pregnancy was an independent predictor of pregnancy intention but there was no correlation between perceived pregnancy risk and pregnancy intention (r = - 0.002, 95% CI - 0.12 to 0.11).\nDISCUSSION: Known clinical predictors of pregnancy risk for women with CKD were not associated with women's perceived pregnancy risk nor pregnancy intention. Importance of pregnancy in women with CKD is high, and influences pregnancy intention, whereas perception of pregnancy risk does not.",

        "Abstract":"INTRODUCTION: Although the investigation of chronic kidney disease of uncertain etiology (CKDu) has identified many possible influencing factors in recent years, the exact pathomechanism of this disease remains unclear.\nMETHODS: In this study, we collected 13 renal biopsies from patients with symptomatic CKDu (Sym-CKDu) from Sri Lanka with well-documented clinical and socioeconomic factors. We performed light microscopy and electron microscopic evaluation for ultrastructural analysis, which was compared with 100 biopsies from German patients with 20 different kidney diseases.\nRESULTS: Of the 13 Sri Lankan patients, 12 were men (92.3%), frequently employed in agriculture (50%), and experienced symptoms such as feeling feverish (83.3%), dysuria (83.3%), and arthralgia (66.6%). Light microscopic evaluation using activity and chronicity score revealed that cases represented early stages of CKDu except for 2 biopsies, which showed additional signs of diabetes. Most glomeruli showed only mild changes, such as podocyte foot process effacement on electron microscopy. We found a spectrum of early tubulointerstitial changes including partial loss of brush border in proximal tubules, detachment of tubular cells, enlarged vacuoles, and mitochondrial swelling associated with loss of cristae and dysmorphic lysosomes with electron-dense aggregates. None of these changes occurred exclusively in Sym-CKDu; however, they were significantly more frequent in these cases than in the control cohort.\nCONCLUSION: In conclusion, our findings confirm the predominant and early alterations of tubular structure in CKDu that can occur without significant glomerular changes. The ultrastructural changes do not provide concrete evidence of the cause of CKDu but were significantly more frequent in Sym-CKDu than in the controls.",

        "Abstract":"Despite significant improvements of renal and obstetrical management, pregnancies in women with glomerular diseases and with lupus nephritis continue to be associated with increased complications both for the mother and the fetus as compared to those of pregnancies in healthy women. To reduce the risk of these complications, planning pregnancy in a phase of stable remission of the underlining disease is necessary. A kidney biopsy is an important event in any phase of pregnancy. A kidney biopsy can be of help during counselling before pregnancy in cases of incomplete remission of the renal manifestations. In these situations, histological data may differentiate active lesions that require the reinforcement of therapy from chronic irreversible lesions that may increase the risk of complications. In pregnant women, a kidney biopsy can identify new-onset systemic lupus erythematous (SLE) and necrotizing or primitive glomerular diseases and distinguish them from other, more common complications. Increasing proteinuria, hypertension, and the deterioration of kidney function during pregnancy may be either due to a reactivation of the underlying disease or to pre-eclampsia. The results of the kidney biopsy suggest the need to initiate an appropriate treatment, allowing the progression of the pregnancy and the fetal viability or the anticipation of delivery. Data from the literature suggest avoiding a kidney biopsy beyond 28 weeks of gestation to minimize the risks associated with the procedure vs. the risk of preterm delivery. In case of the persistence of renal manifestations after delivery in women with a diagnosis of pre-eclampsia, a renal kidney assessment allows the final diagnosis and guides the therapy.",

        "Abstract":"Kidney transplantation is the treatment of choice for patients with kidney failure. Priority on the waiting list and optimal donor-recipient matching are guided by mathematical scores, clinical variables and macroscopic observation of the donated organ. Despite the increasing rates of successful kidney transplantation, maximizing the number of available organs while ensuring the optimum long-term performance of the transplanted kidney remains both key and challenging, and no unequivocal markers are available for clinical decision making. Moreover, the majority of studies performed thus far has focused on the risk of primary non-function and delayed graft function and subsequent survival and have mainly analysed recipients' samples. Given the increasing use of donors with expanded criteria and\/or cardiac death, predicting whether grafts will provide sufficient kidney function is increasingly more challenging. Here we compile the available tools for pre-transplant kidney evaluation and summarize the latest molecular data from donors that may predict short-term (immediate or delayed graft function), medium-term (6 months) and long-term (≥12 months) kidney function. The use of liquid biopsy (urine, serum, plasma) to overcome the limitations of the pre-transplant histological evaluation is proposed. Novel molecules and approaches such as the use of urinary extracellular vesicles are also reviewed and discussed, along with directions for future research.",

Patients with type III crescentic glomerulonephritis had the worst prognosis for primary outcomes (HR, 95% CI for type I vs. type III: 0.29, 0.14-0.58; type II vs. type III: 0.44, 0.22-0.91) and a significantly faster rate of eGFR decline after adjusting for baseline variables. In patients with 75%-100% glomeruli with crescents, the risk of a primary outcome increased nearly fourfold (HR 3.96; 95% CI 2.17-7.23) compared with patients with 50-75% glomeruli with crescents after adjusting for baseline variables. Type of crescentic glomerulonephritis and percentage of cellular and total glomeruli with crescents were independent risk factors for early primary outcomes (within 6 months).\nCONCLUSIONS: This study provides new insights into crescentic glomerulonephritis, including a description of the worst outcomes occurring in patients with type III crescentic glomerulonephritis, and suggests that the quantification of the percentage of crescents may be of use for guiding therapeutic decisions, due to their role in identifying the risk of primary outcomes.",

        "Abstract":"Renal involvement in systemic lupus erythematosus (SLE), so-called lupus nephritis (LN), is one of the most frequent organ manifestations with an incidence of approximately 40-60%. It is not uncommon for renal involvement to be the initial manifestation of SLE or to occur in the first 5-10 years after diagnosis of SLE. Urinalysis is useful in screening for the presence of LN, demonstrating proteinuria or active sediment with acanthocytes. Histologic confirmation of LN, and thus the LN class present, is currently the gold standard for confirming the diagnosis. In addition, knowledge of the LN class is a relevant component of adequate treatment planning in SLE patients with LN. In particular, early diagnosis and rapid response to therapy are of prognostic importance for the preservation of renal function as well as morbidity and mortality of the mostly young patients at the time of initial diagnosis. Thus, the focus of therapy is to achieve complete remission, as well as to avoid active disease phases. Due to a complex pathogenesis and at the same time a very heterogeneous clinical presentation, with six different histological classes of LN, there are different therapeutic targets. This in turn results in a significant expansion of the study landscape in the field of LN with an increasing understanding of the signaling pathways and influencing factors, and fortunately in a growing armamentarium of available targeted therapy options. Simultaneously, new insights into drug therapy to inhibit progression of chronic renal disease are opening up supportive therapy options that can further improve preservation of renal function.",

        "Abstract":"Increased triglycerides (TG) and decreased high-density lipoprotein cholesterol (HDL-C) are dyslipidemias characteristic of diabetes. Here, we aimed to examine associations of TG\/HDL-C ratio with cardiovascular disease (CVD) and kidney dysfunction among patients with diabetic nephropathy. This retrospective observational study consists of patients with biopsy-proven diabetic nephropathy at Nara Medical University Hospital. Exposure of interest was TG\/HDL-C ratio measured at kidney biopsy. Outcome variables were kidney histological findings, incident CVD and end-stage kidney disease (ESKD). Multivariable logistic regression models and Cox proportional hazard models were used to examined these associations. A total of 353 subjects were divided into quartiles based on TG\/HDL-C ratio: Quartile 1 (reference), <1.96; Quartile 2, 1.96-3.10; Quartile 3, 3.11-4.55; and Quartile 4, ≥4.56. TG\/HDL-C ratio was not a predictor of any histological findings in fully adjusted models. During median follow-up periods of 6.2 and 7.3 years, 152 and 90 subjects developed CVD and ESKD, respectively. Higher TG\/HDL-C ratio was independently associated with higher incidences of CVD even after adjustments for potential confounders (hazard ratio [95% confidence interval] for Quartile 3 vs. reference; 1.73 [1.08-2.79] and Quartile 4 vs. reference; 1.86 [1.10-3.17]). Although there was a weak association between TG\/HDL-C ratio and ESKD in the univariable model, the association was not significant in fully adjusted models. In conclusion, among patients with biopsy-proven diabetic nephropathy, higher TG\/HDL-C ratio was independently associated with higher incidences of CVD but not with kidney outcomes, suggesting different impact of TG\/HDL-C ratio on cardiorenal outcomes.",

        "Abstract":"The purpose of this meta-analysis was to evaluate the diagnostic performance of shear wave elastography (SWE) for the staging of renal fibrosis in patients with chronic kidney disease (CKD). Classification of CKD into mild, moderate and severe fibrosis was based on renal biopsy pathology (glomerulosclerosis, tubulointerstitial injury and vascular sclerosis). The Cochrane Library, Medline, PubMed, Web of Science, EMBASE and CNKI databases were searched from January 1, 2009, to April 20, 2022. Pooled sensitivity, specificity, diagnostic odds ratio and area under the receiver operating characteristic curve (AUROC) were calculated using random effects models. A total of 1394 patients from 14 studies were included in the final analysis. For mild, moderate and severe renal fibrosis, SWE had a sensitivity of 0.79 (95% confidence interval [CI]: 0.67-0.88), 0.73 (95% CI: 0.65-0.80) and 0.87 (95% CI: 0.71-0.95); a specificity of 0.82 (95% CI: 0.75-0.87), 72% (95% CI: 0.67-0.77) and 0.83 (95% CI: 0.80-0.86); an AUROC of 0.87 (95% CI: 0.84-0.90), 0.78 (95% CI: 0.75-0.82) and 0.86 (95% CI: 0.82-0.88); and a diagnostic odds ratio of 17 (95% CI: 7-43), 7 (95% CI: 4-12) and 34 (95% CI: 13-88), respectively. Meta-regressions revealed that the publication date, system used and number of valid measurements of SWE were the main causes of heterogeneity. SWE is a good technique for diagnosing mild and severe renal fibrosis, as well as a fair technique for diagnosing moderate fibrosis.",

Data on nephrotic and nephritic syndrome were available in 1992 and 2026 biopsies, respectively. In a subgroup of 898 biopsies containing ≥10 glomeruli from 2018 to 2019, disease chronicity was graded using the Mayo Clinic Chronicity Score (MCCS). The association between clinical variables and MCCS was determined using simple and multiple linear regression models.\nRESULTS: Nephrotic syndrome (present in 378 patients, 19.0%) was most frequently caused by minimal change disease in younger patients (18-44 years), membranous nephropathy in older patients (45-74 years) and amyloidosis in the elderly (>75 years). Nephritic syndrome (present in 421 patients, 20.8%) was most frequently caused by immunoglobulin A nephropathy (IgAN) in younger patients (18-64 years) and ANCA-associated vasculitis (AAV) in older patients (>64 years). AAV and IgAN were the most frequent underlying diagnoses in biopsies in which crescents were identified. In multivariable analysis, acute and chronic kidney disease and diagnoses of diabetic kidney disease, nephrosclerosis and hyperoxaluria\/hypercalcemic nephropathy were associated with the highest MCCS increases.\nCONCLUSIONS: The FCGG registry validates data from previous Western European registries and provides a snapshot of disease chronicity in the whole biopsied Flemish population.",

        "Abstract":"The interest in determining the number of nephrons in the kidney dates back to the 1960s, when an influential laboratory method for determining ex vivo the number of nephrons in the kidneys was described by Bricker. Over the years, various methods have been developed to estimate the number of nephrons in living beings as accurately as possible. These modern methods combine data such as the glomerular density, the percentage of glomeruli in sclerosis calculated from biopsy samples, and the kidney volume, which can be precisely estimated from magnetic resonance, CT scan, or specific ultrasound methods. As the reduction in the number of functioning nephrons is closely connected with an increased risk of progression of renal disease (especially in patients with nephrotic syndrome) and hypertension, its introduction into clinical practice could allow a precise stratification of progression risk in patients with kidney disease and a better understanding of the mechanisms that contribute to the loss of functioning nephrons.",

Previous studies have suggested that urinary level of podocyte-associated molecules may predict the prognosis of DKD.\nSTUDY DESIGN: Observational cohort.\nSETTING & PARTICIPANTS: 118 consecutive patients with biopsy-proven DKD; 13 nondiabetic patients with hypertensive nephrosclerosis as controls.\nPREDICTORS: Urinary podocalyxin and podocin levels were obtained by quantitative polymerase chain reaction and enzyme-linked immunosorbent assay (ELISA) and the corresponding intrarenal levels by western blotting.\nOUTCOMES: Dialysis-free survival; kidney event-free survival; rate of kidney function decline in 12 months.\nANALYTICAL APPROACH: Correlation and time to event analysis.\nRESULTS: Urinary podocalyxin level was closely correlated with its messenger RNA (mRNA) level ( = 0.562,  < 0.001), but this did not predict the progression of DKD. Intrarenal podocalyxin level had only modest correlation with its urinary mRNA and ELISA levels, was an independent predictor of dialysis-free survival (adjusted HR, 1.85; 95% CI, 1.21-2.82;  = 0.005), and showed an insignificant trend of predicting kidney event-free survival (adjusted HR, 1.36; 95% CI, 0.94-1.95;  = 0.10). Urinary podocin level by ELISA had a modest correlation with the rate of kidney function decline ( = 0.238,  = 0.01) but did not predict dialysis-free survival.\nLIMITATIONS: Small sample size; lack of serial measurement.\nCONCLUSIONS: Intrarenal podocalyxin level, but not its urinary level, was an independent predictor of dialysis-free survival, whereas urinary podocin level by ELISA correlated with the rate of kidney function decline. Although intrarenal podocalyxin level has prognostic value, it may not be suitable for routine clinical use.",

Different immunosuppressive agents have been used with inconsistent outcome. We analyzed the data in our FSGS patients who, in addition to steroid, were treated with cyclosporine (CYA), cyclophosphamide (CYP), and mycophenolate mofetil (MMF) along with the long-term follow-up. This is a retrospective analysis of 113 patients diagnosed to have FSGS with 11 years' follow-up carried out at The Kidney Center Post Graduate Training institute. Among 113 patients, 51.3% were male with a mean age of 34.4 ± 11.8 standard deviation. Patients who achieved complete remission with steroid alone and steroid with combination of CYA, CYP, and MMF were 38 (26%), 19 (16.8%), and six (5.3%), respectively, similarly those who got partial remission were three (3.6%), five (4.4%), three (2.6%), and eight (7.0%), respectively. The factors which affected the outcome were serum creatinine (SCr), tubulointerstitial fibrosis (TIF), and the treatment. In adjusted analysis, increase in 1 mg of SCr reduces the patient recovery by 56%, while the absence of TIF increases recovery by 80.75%. Taking steroid as reference category, steroid + CYA found 2.03 times more effective as compared with steroid alone. Seven patients developed end-stage renal disease (ESRD) and three died due to disease during the follow-up. CYA comes out as the most effective treatment for steroid-resistant FSGS followed by MMF and CYP. The long-term outcome of all modalities is the same in terms of mortality and developing ESRD. The degree of TIF and renal failure has strong influence on the course of the disease.",

The advance in medicine over the past years made PRB safer and more feasible. This is an observational retrospective study in a tertiary referral center of pediatric nephrology and was conducted to determine both the indications and the histopathological findings of renal biopsies performed in pediatric patients. The retrospective review of 73 files searching for gender, age, indication for renal biopsy, and histopathological diagnosis of biopsy was done. The statistical analysis was done using Microsoft Excel Worksheet version 2010. The files of 73 cases were reviewed, of which three were excluded due to inadequate sample (success rate of 95.9%). The mean age was 6.9 years (standard deviation ±3.51) with a male-to-female ratio of 1.8:1. The main indication for PRB was nephrotic syndrome (NS) (40%) mainly steroid-resistant NS. Focal segmental glomerulosclerosis was found in most of the cases (46.4%) followed by minimal change disease (32.1%). Among secondary glomerulonephritis, lupus nephritis (LN) was the most common indication (15.7%). Class IV LN came at the top of the list (45.5%). Poststreptococcal GN patients were biopsied when rapidly progressive GN was suspected. Immunoglobulin A nephropathy was found in only 1.4%. Other PRB indications were hematuria (8.6%), unexplained acute (2.9%), or chronic renal failure (4.3%). Renal biopsy remains to be a mainstay diagnostic tool in pediatric nephrology. This study confirms the reliability of PRB as a diagnostic tool which can probably impact the management and hence improve the outcome. The findings in our patients align with findings from other centers and differ in others denoting that disease distribution can vary from one place to another.",

Here we described the clinical and genetic characteristics of biopsy-proven FSGS patients in Thailand. Patients with FSGS pathology, without secondary causes, were included in our study. Clinical laboratory and pathological data were collected. Whole-exome sequencing (WES) was subsequently performed. 53 unrelated FSGS patients were recruited. 35 patients were adults (66.0%), and 51 patients were sporadic cases (96.2%). Clinical diagnosis before kidney biopsy was steroid-resistant nephrotic syndrome (SRNS) in 58.5%, and proteinuric chronic kidney disease in 32.1%. Using WES, disease-associated pathogenic\/likely pathogenic (P\/LP) variants could be identified in six patients including the two familial cases, making the P\/LP detection rate of 11.3% (6\/53). Of these six patients, two patients harbored novel variants with one in the COL4A4 gene and one in the MAFB gene. Four other patients carried previously reported variants in the CLCN5, LMX1B, and COL4A4 genes. Four of these patients (4\/6) received immunosuppressive medications as a treatment for primary FSGS before genetic diagnosis. All four did not respond to the medications, emphasizing the importance of genetic testing to avoid unnecessary treatment. Notably, the mutation detection rates in adult and pediatric patients were almost identical, at 11.4% and 11.1%, respectively. In conclusion, the overall P\/LP variant detection rate by WES in biopsy-proven FSGS patients was 11.3%. The most identified variants were in COL4A4.

Of these, 83 children (90%) had proliferative lupus nephritis (LN) (Class III\/IV ± V). Mycophenolate was used for induction in 36%, whereas 34% received cyclophosphamide (CYC); 55% received mycophenolate as maintenance immunosuppression. The rates of complete remission (CR) and partial remission (PR) at 6 months and 12 months, respectively, were 65% and 20% and 78% and 8%. Two patients died (mortality rate 2.1\/1000 patient-years), with a standardized mortality ratio of 22.3. Three patients (3.2%) developed end-stage kidney disease (ESKD), and advanced CKD occurred in 5 patients (5.4%).

        "Abstract":"OBJECTIVES: IgA nephropathy (IgAN) is the most common primary glomerular disease, and is the leading cause of chronic renal failure. Because mesangial lesions are the main pathological changes seen in IgAN, we investigated factors associated with the progression of mesangial lesions in IgAN.\nMETHODS: We enrolled participants with IgAN who underwent repeat renal biopsies. Based on the progression of mesangial proliferative lesions, the participants were divided into progressive and stable groups. The progression group included participants with a ratio of mesangial cell proliferation score ≥ 1.1 (i.e., proliferation of > 10%) in the second biopsy specimen compared to the first biopsy specimen. The stable group included participants who did not fulfill the aforementioned criteria. We recorded the laboratory parameters, expression of renin-angiotensin system (RAS) receptors (angiotensin II type 1 receptor [AT1R], angiotensin II type 2 receptor [AT2R], Mas receptor [MasR], and the Mas-related G protein-coupled receptor, member D [MrgD]) and mesangial matrix proteins (collagen [Col] IV, fibronectin [FN] and laminin) at the first and second renal biopsies, and the use of immunosuppressive therapy and\/or RAS blockers after the first biopsy.\nRESULTS: We enrolled 24 patients with IgAN who underwent repeat renal biopsies. Half of patients showed progression of mesangial lesions on repeat renal biopsy after a median of 4.3 (1-6) years. The progression group had significantly higher expression levels of AT1R and mesangial matrix proteins (Col IV and FN), and significantly lower expression of AT2R and MasR, compared to the stable group. Multivariate analysis showed that the use of RAS blockers (hazard ratio [HR], 0.27; 95% CI, 0.08-0.97; p < 0.05) and the level of proteinuria (HR, 1.8; 95% CI, 1.04-3.12; p < 0.05) were associated with progression of mesangial lesions. Additionally, the progression group exhibited a more rapid decline of renal function compared to the stable group (0.38 and 0.012 ml\/min\/1.73 m\/month, respectively; p = 0.004).\nCONCLUSIONS: Continuous activation of the intrarenal RAS and massive proteinuria correlate with histological progression of mesangial lesions in IgAN patients, which may further accelerate the deterioration of renal function.",

No scoping review reports have focused on China's spectrum of glomerular diseases in children. This study aimed to systematically identify and describe retrospective studies on pediatric glomerular disease based on available data on sex, age, study period, and region.\nMETHODS: Six databases were systematically searched for relevant studies from initiation to December 2021 in PubMed, Embase, Web of Science, Global Health Library, Wangfang Database, and CNKI.\nRESULTS: Thirty-four studies were identified in the scoping review, including 40,430 patients with biopsy-proven diagnoses. The proportion of boys was significantly higher than that of girls. In this study, 28,280 (70%) cases were primary glomerular disease, 10,547 (26.1%) cases were diagnosed as secondary glomerular disease, and 1146 (2.8%) cases were hereditary glomerular disease. Minimal change disease is the most common glomerular disease among children in China, followed by mesangial proliferative glomerulonephritis, IgA nephropathy, and purpura nephritis. We observed increments in glomerular diseases in periods 2 (2001-2010) and 3 (2011-2021).

The distribution patterns of kidney diseases in these elderly patients remain largely unclear. Here, we compared biopsy-based renal disease patterns between elderly and nonelderly patients. We performed a single-center, retrospective study (1992-2008) on biopsy-proven renal diseases to compare results between geriatric patients (age ≥ 65 years; n = 254) and nongeriatric patients (18 ≤ age < 65 years; n = 2592). Renal pathology was interpreted by pathologists based on light microscopy, immunofluorescence, and electron microscopy. The ages of the geriatric and nongeriatric groups were 71.8 ± 4.5 (65.1-87.3) and 39.7 ± 17.6 (18-64.9) years, respectively, and 74% and 41% of them, respectively, were men. In the geriatric group, the most frequent diagnosis was membranous nephropathy (46.1%), followed by minimal change disease\/focal segmental glomerulosclerosis (16.9%), diabetic nephropathy (8.3%), hypertensive nephrosclerosis (7.5%), and IgA nephropathy (5.9%). The geriatric group had more membranous nephropathy and less lupus nephritis and IgA nephropathy than the nongeriatric group. Furthermore, the 5-year survival rate of the geriatric group was significantly low. Our results demonstrated the different distributions of renal biopsy patterns in geriatric patients diagnosed with acute or chronic progressive kidney injury and proteinuria through renal biopsy.",

To obtain a detailed insight into renal histopathological features of COVID-19, we conducted a review including all studies reporting histopathological findings of diagnostic and postmortem kidney biopsies from patients with COVID-19 published between January 1, 2020, and January 31, 2021. A total of 89 diagnostic and 194 postmortem renal biopsies from individual patients in 39 published studies were investigated and were included in the analysis. In the diagnostic biopsy group, mean age was 56 years and AKI incidence was 96%. In the postmortem biopsy group, mean age was 69 years and AKI incidence was 80%. In the diagnostic biopsy group, the prevalence of acute glomerular diseases was 74%. The most common glomerular lesions were collapsing focal segmental glomerulosclerosis (c-FSGS) in 54% and thrombotic microangiopathy (TMA) in 9% of patients. TMA was also found in 10% of patients in the postmortem biopsy group. The most common acute tubular lesions was acute tubular necrosis (ATN) which was present in 87% of patients in the diagnostic and in 77% of patients in the postmortem biopsy group. Additionally, we observed a high prevalence of preexisting chronic lesions in both groups such as atherosclerosis and glomerulosclerosis. Histopathological changes in renal biopsies of COVID-19 patients show a heterogeneous picture with acute glomerular lesions, predominantly c-FSGS and TMA, and acute tubular lesions, predominantly ATN.

However, little is known about the prevalence of Fabry nephropathy (FN) in patients with chronic kidney disease (CKD). We extracted FN data from the Japan Renal Biopsy Registry, analyzed the prevalence of FN, and examined the correlation between clinical characteristics and renal involvement according to sex differences and hemi- and heterozygosity in patients with FD.\nMETHODS: A total of 38,351 participants who underwent renal biopsy were retrospectively enrolled, and FN was determined. The clinical characteristics of FD patients were examined based on sex differences.\nRESULTS: Twenty-nine patients (0.076%) (19 males and 10 females, mean age: 43.7 ± 15.5 years old) were diagnosed with FN. Median estimated urinary protein (UP) and mean eGFR levels were 0.9 [interquartile range (IQR) [0.7-1.6] g\/gCr and 67.1 ± 36.8 mL\/min\/1.73 m, respectively.

An inverse correlation between eGFR and logarithm UP levels was observed (r = 0.23, p = 0.02), SBP was positively associated with logarithm UP (r = 0.34, p = 0.004) overall and inversely associated with eGFR (r = 0.25, p = 0.007) regardless of sex, and SBP was an independent determinant of proteinuria (p = 0.004) and eGFR (p = 0.007).\nCONCLUSIONS: The prevalence of biopsy-proven FN was 0.076%. Since SBP is associated with eGFR regardless of zygosity, strict SBP control might be necessary to prevent progression to end-stage kidney disease in both male and female patients with FN.",

Patients were divided into the lower bile acids group (≤2.8 mmol\/L) and higher bile acids group (>2.8 mmol\/L) based on the cutoff value of bile acids obtained using the time-dependent receiver-operating characteristic curve. Renal outcomes were defined as end-stage renal disease (ESRD). The influence of bile acids on renal outcomes and correlations between bile acids and clinicopathological indicators were evaluated.\nRESULTS: Bile acids were positively correlated with age (r = 0.152; P = 0.040) and serum albumin (r = 0.148; P = 0.045) and negatively correlated with total cholesterol (r = -0.151; P = 0.041) and glomerular class (r = -0.164; P =0.027). During follow-up, 64 of 184 patients (34.78%) experienced progression to ESRD. Lower levels of proteinuria, serum albumin, and bile acids were independently associated with an increased risk of ESRD (hazard ratio, R=5.319; 95% confidence interval, 1.208-23.425).\nCONCLUSIONS: Bile acids are an independent risk factor for adverse renal outcomes of DKD patients.

The purpose of this study is to assess the utility of kidney biopsy for the management of glomerulopathies in an Eastern European cohort, targeting patients older than 65 years.\nMETHODS: This retrospective study included 875 adults (147 older than 65 years), with biopsy-proven glomerulopathies, followed up for 71.1 (95% CI 68.2-73.9) months. The primary endpoint was chronic renal replacement therapy initiation. Statistical evaluation was performed with IBM SPSS software version 20, Analyse-it, and SAS Studio. The Kaplan-Meier method was used to estimate the time to death and the log-rank test was used for comparisons. The multivariate Cox proportional hazard analysis was used to evaluate the risk of death.\nRESULTS: Secondary glomerulopathies were more frequent in patients aged > 65 years (52.4% vs. 41.9%, p = 0.004). Membranous nephropathy and amyloidosis were the most frequent primary and secondary glomerulopathies in this age group. Kidney biopsy complications were low (< 4%) in both age groups. In 42% of the elderly, the result of biopsy guided the immunosuppressive therapy. While the all-cause mortality rate was higher (OR 4.2; 95% CI 2.7-6.7; p < 0.0001) in elderly individuals, the rate of renal replacement therapy initiation was similar (31.3 vs 26%; p = 0.1) in both age groups. In the competitive risk analysis, kidney survival was similar irrespective of age [CIF 0.4 (95% CI 0.26-0.53) vs. 0.34 (95% CI 0.28-0.39), p = 0.08]. However, after adjusting for the confounding factors, younger age was associated with an increased risk of renal replacement therapy (HR = 1.57, p = 0.01), along with secondary glomerulopathies.\nCONCLUSION: The diagnosis of an underlying glomerulopathy guided the therapy in almost one-half of the elderly patients who underwent a kidney biopsy, provided important prognostic information and had a low complications rate; kidney biopsy may therefore be considered a safe, reliable procedure in the management of glomerulopathies, even in patients over 65 years of age.",

Kidney disease has heterogeneity in histology in diabetes patients and includes both diabetic kidney disease (DKD) (albuminuric or nonalbuminuric) and nondiabetic kidney disease (NDKD) either in isolation or in coexistence with DN. Diabetic nephropathy is hard to overturn. While NDKD is treatable and reversible.\nMATERIALS AND METHODS: We enrolled a total of 50 type 2 diabetes mellitus (T2DM) patients with clinical kidney disease, of both genders and age &gt;18 years, who underwent kidney biopsy from October 2016 to October 2018. Patients with proteinuria &lt;30 mg per day were excluded from the study. The indications of the renal biopsy were nephrotic syndrome (NS), active urinary sediment, rapid decline in renal function, asymptomatic proteinuria, and hematuria.\nRESULT: A total of 50 (males: 42 and females: eight) patients with T2DM who underwent kidney biopsy were enrolled. The clinical presentation was: NS 26 (52%), chronic kidney disease (CKD) 11 (22%), asymptomatic proteinuria and hematuria six (12%), acute kidney injury (AKI) four (8%), and acute nephritic syndrome (ANS) three (6%). Diabetic retinopathy (DR) was noted in 19 (38%) cases. Kidney biopsy revealed isolated DN, isolated NDKD, and NDKD superimposed on DN in 26 (52%), 14 (28%), and 10 (20%) cases, respectively. Idiopathic membranous nephropathy (MN) (4) and amyloidosis (2) were the most common forms of NDKD, whereas diffuse proliferative glomerulonephritis (DPGN) was the main form of NDKD superimposed on DN. Diabetic nephropathy was observed in 15 (79%) cases in presence of DR and also in 11 (35.5%) cases even in absence of DR. Of eight patients with microalbuminuria four (50%) cases have biopsy-proven DN.\nCONCLUSION: About 48% of patients had NDKD either in isolation or in coexistence with DN. Diabetic nephropathy was found in absence of DR and in patients with a low level of proteinuria. The level of proteinuria and presence of DR does not help to distinguish DN vs NDKD. Hence, renal biopsy may be useful in selected T2DM patients with clinical kidney disease to diagnose NDKD.",

        "Abstract":"OBJECTIVE: This retrospective analysis evaluated the prognostic value of renal response status 2 years after biopsy-proven lupus nephritis (LN) for the prediction of long-term renal outcomes.\nMETHODS: Eligible patients with SLE as per American College of Rheumatology or Systemic Lupus International Collaborating Clinics criteria and biopsy-proven class III, IV, V or mixed LN were identified from the Hopkins Lupus Cohort, and categorised into binary renal response categories (modified primary efficacy renal response (mPERR) or no mPERR at 2 years post biopsy). These categories were defined by a modified version of the Belimumab International Lupus Nephritis Study (BLISS-LN) protocol using urine protein:creatinine ratio (≤0.7 g\/day) and estimated glomerular filtration rate (≥60 mL\/min\/1.73 m or ≤20% below the baseline value) criteria. Long-term renal survival (defined as survival without end-stage renal disease (ESRD) or death) and chronic renal insufficiency-free survival were assessed in Kaplan-Meier plots with log-rank test and covariate-adjusted Cox proportional hazards models.\nRESULTS: Of the 173 eligible patients, 91.3% were female; the mean (SD) age at biopsy was 36.2 (11.8) years. At 2 years post biopsy, 114 (65.9%) patients achieved mPERR. These patients showed a lower risk of ESRD\/death and chronic renal insufficiency in the follow-up period (HR (95% CI) 0.33 (0.13 to 0.87), p=0.0255; and HR (95% CI) 0.26 (0.14 to 0.47), p<0.0001, respectively).\nCONCLUSIONS: The 2-year post-biopsy renal response status, defined per 2019-updated BLISS-LN criteria, has prognostic value for long-term renal survival and lower risk of chronic renal insufficiency in patients with LN.",

Both can be independent entities; however, renal insufficiency can also be caused by the paraprotein. We assessed all kidney biopsies in patients with monoclonal gammopathy in our clinic over the past 20 years and evaluated the histological results. : Biopsies were systematically performed in nearly all patients with paraproteinemia and impaired kidney function ( = 178). The histological findings were systematically evaluated and correlated with the initial clinical diagnosis. : We found cast nephropathy (CN) in  = 66 (37.1%) biopsies, AL amyloidosis in  = 31 (17.4%) biopsies, monoclonal immunoglobulin deposition disease (MIDD) in  = 7 (3.9%) biopsies and other renal diseases (ORDs) in  = 74 (41.6%) biopsies. In the latter group, paraprotein-associated changes were found in 37 of 74 (50%) patients, whereas paraprotein-independent changes were found in the other half. Whereas, in the group of patients with MGUS, the findings were heterogenous, most of the patients with known multiple myeloma (MM) or B-NHL showed malignancy-associated changes in the kidney. The biopsy changed the diagnoses in a significant proportion of the patients: The group of patients with MM grew from 71 to 112 patients, whereas, in the MGUS group, only 31 of 44 patients remained. : Kidney biopsies in patients with paraproteinemia and renal impairment show a wide range of findings that can lead to a change in diagnosis.",

        "Abstract":"BACKGROUND: There is scarce information on biopsy-verified kidney disease in childhood and its progression to chronic kidney disease stage 5 (CKD 5). This study aims to review biopsy findings in children, and to investigate risk of kidney replacement therapy (KRT).\nMETHODS: We conducted a retrospective long-term follow-up study of children included in the Norwegian Kidney Biopsy Registry (NKBR) and in the Norwegian Renal Registry (NRR) from 1988 to 2021.\nRESULTS: In total, 575 children with a median (interquartile range, IQR) age of 10.7 (6.1 to 14.1) years were included, and median follow-up time (IQR) after kidney biopsy was 14.3 (range 8.9 to 21.6) years. The most common biopsy diagnoses were minimal change disease (MCD; n = 92), IgA vasculitis nephritis (IgAVN; n = 76), IgA nephropathy (n = 63), and focal and segmental glomerulosclerosis (FSGS; n = 47). In total, 118 (20.5%) of the biopsied children reached CKD 5, median (IQR) time to KRT 2.3 years (7 months to 8.4 years). Most frequently, nephronophthisis (NPHP; n = 16), FSGS (n = 30), IgA nephropathy (n = 9), and membranoproliferative glomerulonephritis (MPGN; n = 9) led to KRT.\nCONCLUSIONS: The risk of KRT after a kidney biopsy diagnosis is highly dependent on the diagnosis. None of the children with MCD commenced KRT, while 63.8% with FSGS and 100% with NPHP reached KRT.

One hundred patients were included and divided into an early DN group (eGFR ≥ 60 ml\/min, n = 42) and an advanced DN group (eGFR < 60 ml\/min, n = 58). The valerate and caproate were measured using gas chromatography-mass spectrometry.

We observed a significant lower concentration of valerate and caproate in the advanced DN group. There were negative correlations between valerate and glomerular classification (r = - 0.20, P = 0.03) and between caproate and interstitial fibrosis and tubular atrophy (IFTA) (r = - 0.24, P = 0.01).

Resistance of microorganisms to antibiotics is a challenging issue for clinicians in everyday practice. In the current study, we investigated the rates of sepsis and hospital admissions following transperineal (TP) prostate biopsies using a single dose of gentamicin.\nMATERIAL AND METHODS: Data for consecutive patients who underwent TP prostate biopsies (March 2019-March 2020) were included. Patients received a single-dose of prophylactic gentamicin 120 mg IV and had skin preparation with antiseptic povidone-iodine or chlorhexidine solution prior to the procedure. Patient's electronic records were reviewed for rates of sepsis and readmission to hospital within 7 days following TP prostate biopsy.\nRESULTS: A total of 365 consecutive patients were included in the study. After exclusion of non-eligible patients, 280 patients were included in final analysis. The median age was 67 years (32-83), the median prostate-specific antigen (PSA) level was 8.5 ng\/ml (0.2-58), and the median prostate size was 44 cc (10-188). Approximately 58% of patients had one or more comorbidities in the form of diabetes mellitus (DM), hypertension, asthma, chronic kidney disease, or ischemic heart disease. Adenocarcinoma was found in 71.7% of patients. None of the 280 patients developed sepsis. Urinary tract infection (UTI) occurred in 2.8% of patients with E.coli, none of them required hospital readmission.\nCONCLUSIONS: Our single centre experience showed a 0% sepsis rate after TP prostate biopsy with single prophylactic dose of gentamicin. Future randomized controlled trials (RCTs) should explore the possibility of performing these procedures without antibiotic prophylaxis in order to reduce the unnecessary use of antibiotics.",

        "Abstract":"BACKGROUND: Semiquantitative visual inspection for glomerulosclerosis, interstitial fibrosis, and arteriosclerosis is often used to assess chronic changes in native kidney biopsies. Morphometric evaluation of these and other chronic changes may improve the prognostic assessment.\nMETHODS: We studied a historical cohort of patients who underwent a native kidney biopsy between 1993 and 2015 and were followed through 2021 for ESKD and for progressive CKD (defined as experiencing 50% eGFR decline, temporary dialysis, or ESKD). Pathologist scores for the percentages of globally sclerosed glomeruli (GSG), interstitial fibrosis and tubular atrophy (IFTA), and arteriosclerosis (luminal stenosis) were available. We scanned biopsy sections into high-resolution images to trace microstructures. Morphometry measures were percentage of GSG; percentage of glomerulosclerosis (percentage of GSG, ischemic-appearing glomeruli, or segmentally sclerosed glomeruli); percentage of IFTA; IFTA foci density; percentage of artery luminal stenosis; arteriolar hyalinosis counts; and measures of nephron size. Models assessed risk of ESKD or progressive CKD with biopsy measures adjusted for age, hypertension, diabetes, body mass index, eGFR, and proteinuria.\nRESULTS: Of 353 patients (followed for a median 7.5 years), 75 developed ESKD and 139 experienced progressive CKD events. Visually estimated scores by pathologists versus morphometry measures for percentages of GSG, IFTA, and luminal stenosis did not substantively differ in predicting outcomes. However, adding percentage of glomerulosclerosis, IFTA foci density, and arteriolar hyalinosis improved outcome prediction. A 10-point score using percentage of glomerulosclerosis, percentage of IFTA, IFTA foci density, and any arteriolar hyalinosis outperformed a 10-point score based on percentages of GSG, IFTA, and luminal stenosis >50% in discriminating risk of ESKD or progressive CKD.\nCONCLUSION: Morphometric characterization of glomerulosclerosis, IFTA, and arteriolar hyalinosis on kidney biopsy improves prediction of long-term kidney outcomes.",

        "Abstract":"BACKGROUND AND OBJECTIVES: Digital pathology and artificial intelligence offer new opportunities for automatic histologic scoring. We applied a deep learning approach to IgA nephropathy biopsy images to develop an automatic histologic prognostic score, assessed against ground truth (kidney failure) among patients with IgA nephropathy who were treated over 39 years. We assessed noninferiority in comparison with the histologic component of currently validated predictive tools. We correlated additional histologic features with our deep learning predictive score to identify potential additional predictive features.\nDESIGN, SETTING, PARTICIPANTS, & MEASUREMENTS: Training for deep learning was performed with randomly selected, digitalized, cortical Periodic acid-Schiff-stained sections images (363 kidney biopsy specimens) to develop our deep learning predictive score. We estimated noninferiority using the area under the receiver operating characteristic curve (AUC) in a randomly selected group (95 biopsy specimens) against the gold standard Oxford classification (MEST-C) scores used by the International IgA Nephropathy Prediction Tool and the clinical decision supporting system for estimating the risk of kidney failure in IgA nephropathy. We assessed additional potential predictive histologic features against a subset (20 kidney biopsy specimens) with the strongest and weakest deep learning predictive scores.\nRESULTS: We enrolled 442 patients; the 10-year kidney survival was 78%, and the study median follow-up was 6.7 years. Manual MEST-C showed no prognostic relationship for the endocapillary parameter only. The deep learning predictive score was not inferior to MEST-C applied using the International IgA Nephropathy Prediction Tool and the clinical decision supporting system (AUC of 0.84 versus 0.77 and 0.74, respectively) and confirmed a good correlation with the tubolointerstitial score (r=0.41, <0.01). We observed no correlations between the deep learning prognostic score and the mesangial, endocapillary, segmental sclerosis, and crescent parameters. Additional potential predictive histopathologic features incorporated by the deep learning predictive score included () inflammation within areas of interstitial fibrosis and tubular atrophy and () hyaline casts.\nCONCLUSIONS: The deep learning approach was noninferior to manual histopathologic reporting and considered prognostic features not currently included in MEST-C assessment.\nPODCAST: This article contains a podcast at https:\/\/www.asn-online.org\/media\/podcast\/CJASN\/2022_07_26_CJN01760222.mp3.",

We compared clinical and histopathology findings in those with calcification (n = 429) compared to those without calcification (n = 3,936). Patients with calcification were older, had more comorbidities, lower estimated glomerular filtration rates (eGFR), were more likely to have hyaline arteriosclerosis, interstitial fibrosis\/tubular atrophy, and a primary pathologic diagnosis of acute tubular injury or acute tubular necrosis when compared to patients without calcification. Patients with calcium oxalate deposition alone, compared to calcium phosphate or mixed calcifications, had fewer comorbidities but were more likely to have a history of gastric bypass surgery or malabsorption and take vitamin D. In patients with two or more years of follow-up, multivariate analyses showed the presence of calcification (HR 0.59, 0.38-0.92, p = 0.02) and higher eGFR (HR 0.76, 0.73-0.79, p < 0.001), was associated with decreased likelihood of progressing to end-stage renal disease. The presence of calcification was also associated with a reduced slope\/decline in eGFR compared to known biopsy and clinical risk factors for decline in kidney function. We hypothesized this was due to more recoverable acute kidney injury (AKI) and found more severe acute kidney injury network stage in patients with kidney calcification but also greater improvement over time.\nDISCUSSION\/CONCLUSION: In summary, we demonstrated that calcification on kidney biopsy specimens was associated with a better prognosis than those without calcification due to the association with recoverable AKI.",

For receiver operating characteristic (ROC) curve showed that the optimal cut-off for AAR to predict end stage renal disease (ESRD) was 1.22. So, patients were divided into two groups according to their AAR at the time of renal biopsy: high AAR Group (those with AAR > 1.22); low AAR Group (those with AAR ≤1.22).

        "Published":"2022-07-14",
        "Abstract":"BACKGROUND: Glomerulopathy with fibronectin deposits (GFND) is a rare autosomal dominant genetic disorder, and proteinuria and hematuria are the most common clinical manifestations. The pathogenesis of this disease is primarily related to mutation of the fibronectin 1 gene. Unfortunately, without specific treatment, the prognosis remains poor. Here we present a case report that investigates the clinical characteristics, renal pathology, and gene testing of childhood GFND.\nCASE PRESENTATION: A two-year-old child was brought to our hospital for \"persistent hematuria for 1 year and 10 months.\" The disease onset was at the age of 4 months, with persistent microscopic hematuria accompanied by intermittent gross hematuria, occasionally with proteinuria, and without hypertension or renal failure. The chief complaint was intermittent gross hematuria, without massive proteinuria, hypertension, or renal failure. Family history: The child's mother had microscopic hematuria, his maternal aunt had nephrotic syndrome due to focal segmental glomerulosclerosis, and his maternal grandmother had end-stage renal disease. No significant pathological changes were found in the renal pathological biopsy of the child under a light microscope. Under the electron microscope, the basement membrane was found to be of uneven thickness, ranging from 150 to 400 nm. The stratum compactum of the basement membrane was thickened, with a small part showing tear-like and cobweb-like morphology. No electron-dense deposits were found. The renal tubular epithelial cells were vacuolated, and there were no unique pathological changes in the renal interstitium. Immunofluorescence showed that IgG, IgM, IgA, C3, and C1q were all negative. Alport syndrome was preliminarily considered. However, exome sequencing revealed a mutated site in the fibronectin 1 gene. The child's mother was the carrier of the pathogenic gene and the final diagnosis was GFND.\nCONCLUSIONS: Fibronectin deposition is a typical pathological change in GFND, and the disease progresses slowly to end-stage renal disease. There is no specific treatment so far, and the prognosis is poor. The early onset of childhood patients may not show typical renal pathological changes, but only changes in the thickness of basement membrane, etc. Genome sequencing technology may helpful for the early diagnosis of GFND.",

        "Abstract":"CONTEXT.—: Galectin-9 reduces tissue damage in certain immune-mediated glomerular diseases. However, its role in structural and functional renal changes in patients with varying types of chronic kidney disease (CKD) is less clear.\nOBJECTIVE.—: To investigate the association between plasma galectin-9 levels, proteinuria, tubulointerstitial lesions, and renal function in different CKD stages.\nDESIGN.—: We measured plasma galectin-9 levels in 243 patients undergoing renal biopsy for determining the CKD etiology. mRNA and protein expression levels of intrarenal galectin-9 were assessed by quantitative real-time polymerase chain reaction and immunostaining. Relationships between plasma galectin-9, clinical characteristics, and tubulointerstitial damage were analyzed with logistic regression. We investigated galectin-9 expression patterns in vitro in murine J774 macrophages treated with differing stimuli.\nRESULTS.—: To analyze the relationship between galectin-9 and clinical features, we divided the patients into 2 groups according to median plasma galectin-9 levels. The high galectin-9 group tended to be older and to have decreased renal function, higher proteinuria, and greater interstitial fibrosis. After multivariable adjustment, elevated plasma galectin-9 levels were independently associated with stage 3b or higher CKD. An analysis of gene expression in the tubulointerstitial compartment in the biopsy samples showed a significant positive correlation between intrarenal galectin-9 mRNA expression and plasma galectin-9 levels. Immunohistochemistry confirmed increased galectin-9 expression in the renal interstitium of patients with advanced CKD, and most galectin-9-positive cells were macrophages, as determined by double-immunofluorescence staining. In vitro experiments showed that galectin-9 expression in macrophages was significantly increased after interferon-γ stimulation.\nCONCLUSIONS.—: Our findings suggest that plasma galectin-9 is a good biomarker for diagnosing advanced CKD.",

The NOTCH signaling is activated in many biological processes including nephrogenesis, tubulogenesis, and glomerulogenesis, as well as during pathological situations. Activation of Notch signaling is characterized by successive proteolytic cleavages triggered by the interaction between membrane-bound Notch receptors and ligands expressed on neighboring cells.

We aimed to compare parameters of bone turnover, mineralization, and volume assessed by bone biopsies with results derived from 18F-NaF PET\/CT and biomarkers (bone-specific alkaline phosphatase, osteocalcin, fibroblast growth factor 23, and osteoprotegerin).\nMETHODS: A cross-sectional study included 17 dialysis patients, and results from 18F-NaF PET\/CT scans and the biomarkers were directly compared with the results of histomorphometric analyses of tetracycline double-labeled trans-iliac bone biopsies.\nRESULTS: Bone biopsies showed 40% high, 20% normal, and 40% low bone turnover. No biopsies had generalized abnormal mineralization, and the bone volume\/total tissue volume was low in 80% and high in 7%. The pelvic skeletal plasma clearance (Ki) from 18F-NaF PET\/CT correlated with bone turnover parameters obtained by bone biopsy (activation frequency: r = 0.82, p < 0.01; bone formation rate\/bone surface: r = 0.81, p < 0.01), and Ki defined low turnover with high sensitivity (83%) and specificity (100%). CT-derived radiodensity correlated with bone volume, r = 0.82, p < 0.01.

        "Abstract":"BACKGROUND: Currently, following the new advances in cancer treatments and the increasing prevalence of kidney disease in the population, more kidney biopsies are being performed. The aim of our study is to analyze clinical and histological characteristics of patients with active solid organ malignancy who underwent kidney biopsy. This is a multi-center collaborative retrospective study supported by groups GLOSEN\/Onconephrology from the Spanish Society of Nephrology. Clinical, demographical and histological data were collected.\nRESULTS: A total of 148 patients with cancer who underwent a kidney biopsy from 12 hospitals were included. 64.3% men and mean age of 66.9 years old. The indications for biopsy were acute renal injury (67.1%), proteinuria (17.1%), exacerbated chronic kidney disease (8.2%), and chronic kidney disease (7.5%). Most frequent malignances were lung (29.1%) and abdominal (25%), with 49.7% metastatic cancer. As oncospecific treatment, 28% received chemotherapy, 29.3% immunotherapy, 19.3% specific therapies, and 2.1% conservative treatment. At the time of kidney biopsy, median creatinine was of 2.58 mg\/dL [1.81-4.1 (IQ 25-75)], median urine protein-to-creatinine ratio of 700 mg\/g [256-2463 (IQ 25-75)] and 53.1% presented hematuria. The most frequent renal biopsy diagnoses were: acute interstitial nephritis (39.9%), acute tubular necrosis (8.8%), IgA nephropathy (7.4%) and membranous nephropathy (6.1%). Median follow-up was 15.2 months [5.7-31.4 (IQ 25-75)].\nCONCLUSIONS: There is a new trend in kidney disease and cancer patients in terms of diagnosis and treatment. Acute interstitial nephritis has established itself as the most common kidney injury in patients with cancer who underwent a kidney biopsy. Renal biopsy is a valuable tool for diagnosis, treatment, and prognosis of solid organ cancer patients with kidney damage.",

Clinical and histological findings at first and at second biopsy were analysed with Cox proportional hazard models to predict ESKD, defined as start of kidney replacement therapy. Survival curves were calculated with Kaplan-Meier method.\nRESULTS: Ninety-two patients with LN were included, 87% females, mean follow-up 17.9±10.1 years. Reasons for second kidney biopsy encompassed nephritic flares (n=28, 30.4%), proteinuric flares (n=46, 50%) or lack of renal response (n=18, 19.5%). Class switch from first biopsy occurred in 50.5% of cases, mainly from non-proliferative towards proliferative classes. Class IV remained stable in over 50% of cases. Twenty-five patients (27.2%) developed ESKD, mostly belonging to the nephritic flare group (17\/28, 60.7%). Independent predictors of ESKD at second biopsy were activity index (AI; (HR 95% CI) 1.20 (1.03 to 1.41), p=0.022), chronicity index (CI; 1.41 (1.09 to 1.82), p=0.008) and 24h-proteinuria (1.22 (1.04 to 1.42), p=0.013). AI≥2 (log-rank p=0.031), CI >4 (log-rank p=0.001) or proteinuria ≥3.5 g\/day (log-rank=0.009) identified thresholds for higher ESKD risk. In a subgroup analysis, glomerular activity and tubular chronicity mostly accounted for AI and CI association with ESKD. No histological or laboratory predictors emerged at first biopsy (95% CI): AI: 0.88 to 1.19; CI: 0.66 to 1.20; proteinuria 0.85 to 1.08.\nCONCLUSIONS: Findings at second but not at first kidney biopsy in patients with persistently active or relapsing LN inform about ESKD development in a long-term follow-up.",

        "Abstract":"Bone Biopsy (BB) with histomorphometric analysis still represents the gold standard for the diagnosis and classification of different forms of renal osteodystrophy. Bone biopsy is the only technique able to provide comprehensive information on all bone parameters, measuring static and dynamic parameters of turnover, cortical and trabecular microarchitecture, and mineralization defects. In nephrological practice, bone biopsy yields relevant indications to support therapeutic choices in CKD, heavily impacting the management and prognosis of uremic patients. Unfortunately, the use of bone biopsy has decreased; a lack of expertise in performing and interpreting, perceived procedure invasiveness and pain, and reimbursement issues have all contributed to this decline. Nevertheless, both bone biomarkers and instrumental images cannot be considered reliable surrogates for histological findings, being insufficiently accurate to properly evaluate underlying mineral and bone disorders. This is a multidisciplinary position paper from the Nephrology and Osteoporosis Italian Scientific Societies with the purpose of restating the role of bone biopsy in CKD patient management and of providing strong solutions to allow diffusion of this technique in Italy, but potentially also in other countries. The Italian approach through the optimization and standardization of bone biopsy procedure, the construction of the Italian Hub and Spoke network, and a request for adjustment and national homogenization of reimbursement to the Italian Health Ministry has led the way to implement bone biopsy and to improve CKD patient management and prognosis.",

We analyzed prospective data from patients with kidney disease who underwent percutaneous native kidney biopsies from January 2006 to December 2017. Demographic data, clinical presentations, and the laboratory and radiological findings at the time of biopsy were analyzed. Of 530 patients, 42.8% were male. The mean age was 33.9 (32.8-34.9.2) years; 66.3% were aged 25-64 years. Edema was the main clinical presentation (61.9%), with clinical urine changes seen in 66.7%. Most (89.6%) were nondiabetic; 46.8% had high blood pressure or were on antihypertensive therapy. Most patients (77.5%) were in Stages I, II, and III, and 12.3% underwent hemodialysis at the time of admission. Most (54.4%) were obese. Low hemoglobin (31.8%), high triglycerides (30%), high total cholesterol (58.2%), low serum albumin (73.9%), nephrotic proteinuria (61.8.6%), and microscopic hematuria (79.8%) were the main laboratory findings.

        "Published":"2022-04-07",
        "Abstract":"All transplanted kidneys are subjected to some degree of injury as a result of the donation-implantation process and various post-transplant stresses such as rejection. Because transplants are frequently biopsied, they present an opportunity to explore the full spectrum of kidney response-to-wounding from all causes. Defining parenchymal damage in transplanted organs is important for clinical management because it determines function and survival. In this study, we classified the scenarios associated with parenchymal injury in genome-wide microarray results from 1,526 kidney transplant indication biopsies collected during the INTERCOMEX study. We defined injury groups by using archetypal analysis (AA) of scores for gene sets and classifiers previously identified in various injury states. Six groups and their characteristics were defined in this population: No injury, minor injury, two classes of acute kidney injury (\"AKI,\" AKI1, and AKI2), chronic kidney disease (CKD), and CKD combined with AKI. We compared the two classes of AKI, namely, AKI1 and AKI2. AKI1 had a poor function and increased parenchymal dedifferentiation but minimal response-to-injury and inflammation, instead having increased expression of PARD3, a gene previously characterized as being related to epithelial polarity and adherens junctions. In contrast, AKI2 had a poor function and increased response-to-injury, significant inflammation, and increased macrophage activity. In random forest analysis, the most important predictors of function (estimated glomerular filtration rate) and graft loss were injury-based molecular scores, not rejection scores. AKI1 and AKI2 differed in 3-year graft survival, with better survival in the AKI2 group. Thus, injury archetype analysis of injury-induced gene expression shows new heterogeneity in kidney response-to-wounding, revealing AKI1, a class of early transplants with a poor function but minimal inflammation or response to injury, a deviant response characterized as PC3, and an increased risk of failure. Given the relationship between parenchymal injury and kidney survival, further characterization of the injury phenotypes in kidney transplants will be important for an improved understanding that could have implications for understanding native kidney diseases (ClinicalTrials.gov #NCT01299168).",

        "Abstract":"BACKGROUND: Acute and chronic kidney diseases are important comorbidities in People Living With HIV (PLWH). Biopsy is often pursued in this cohort with ongoing renal impairment without a clear aetiology, in order to establish the diagnosis and to guide management. Despite the importance of renal disease in PLWH, there is a paucity of biopsy data-especially in the Australian setting. Consequently, who and when to biopsy is mainly based on clinical experience. The aims of this study were to describe biopsy-proven renal disease in PLWH at our institution and to assess for correlation between any demographic or laboratory characteristics with histological diagnosis.\nMETHODS: A retrospective review of all PLWH who underwent renal biopsy between January 2010 and December 2020 at Royal Prince Alfred Hospital, Sydney, Australia was performed. All PLWH over 18 years, who were not transplant recipients were included. Demographic, laboratory and biopsy data was extracted from the electronic medical records. Basic descriptive statistics were performed, and correlation was assessed using chi square and Kendall's coefficient of rank test.\nRESULTS: 19 renal biopsies were included in the study. The majority of PLWH were Australian born (53%), male (84%) and had a mean age of 48 years (SD 13). Comorbid hypertension and diabetes were present in 74% and 21% of people respectively. The mean serum creatinine was 132 µmol\/L (SD 55) and the mean estimated glomerular filtration rate (eGFR) was 61 ml\/min\/1.73m (SD 24). The most common histological diagnosis was tubulointerstial nephritis in 5 people (24%). Hypertensive glomerulosclerosis and IgA nephropathy were present in 4 (19%) and 3 (14%) people respectively. There were no cases of HIV-associated nephropathy. There was no significant correlation between any cohort characteristics and diagnoses.\nCONCLUSIONS: This study represents the first description of biopsy-proven kidney disease in the HIV-infected population of Australia. Our results support the use of renal biopsy in PLWH with ongoing renal impairment for accurate diagnosis and to guide further management.

In developing countries, it is the most common cause of end-stage renal disease (ESRD). Chronic kidney disease affects 10-16% of the adult population in Asia, including 21.2% in Pakistan. This study aims to determine the frequency and spectrum of glomerulonephritis at our center. Methodology This is a cross-sectional analysis of 81 renal core biopsies obtained between August 2020 and August 2021. The histopathological reports, demographic data, and relevant laboratory investigations, such as blood urea and creatinine levels, were collected. All cases were blindly reviewed by two pathologists with a special interest in medical renal pathology. Data were analyzed using SPSS version 22 (IBM Corp., Armonk, NY, USA). Results The majority of the patients (46.9%) were between the ages of 21 and 40 years. There was a slight male predominance, with 44 (54.3%) of the 81 participants being male. Hematuria was reported in 20 (24.7%) patients, with mean serum urea and creatinine levels of 75 mg\/dL and 2.6 mg\/dL, respectively. Nephrotic syndrome was the most common indication for a renal biopsy, accounting for 54 (67.7%) of the 81 cases. Chronic glomerulonephritis is classified into two categories, namely, primary and secondary glomerulonephritis. Focal segmental glomerulosclerosis (FSGS), the leading cause of primary glomerulonephritis, was found in 25 (30.9%) 81 patients. Furthermore, lupus nephritis (9.9%) and advanced glomerulonephritis (9.9%) were found in equal proportions among secondary glomerulonephritis. Conclusions According to our study, nephrotic syndrome was the most common indication for medical renal biopsy, with FSGS being the most common primary glomerulonephritis. Lupus nephritis and advanced glomerulonephritis were the most common secondary glomerulonephritis diagnoses.",

        "Abstract":"INTRODUCTION: To date, almost 7 billion doses of the different types of vaccine against SARS-CoV-2 have been administered worldwide. Although the severity of new cases of SARS-CoV-2 has progressively decreased, and the pressure on national health systems has declined, the development of de novo glomerular injuries has been suggested.\nMETHODS: This study aimed to examine the patients who were hospitalized in our Unit between April and November 2021 and underwent renal biopsy for new-onset urinary abnormalities (UA) and\/or renal impairment within 3 months of SARS-CoV-2 vaccination.\nRESULTS: We identified 17 patients who developed UA and\/or renal insufficiency within 3 months of vaccination. Minimal change disease was the most common disease in our cohort (5 patients, 29.4%) followed by acute tubulointerstitial nephritis (TIN; 3 patients, 17.6%), membranous nephropathy (3 patients, 17.6%), and rapidly progressive IgA nephropathy (2 patients, 11.8%). The other 4 patients had a diagnosis of membranoproliferative glomerulonephritis (1 patient), systemic lupus erythematosus (1 patient), ANCA-associated vasculitis (1 patient), and tip-variant focal segmental glomerulosclerosis (1 patient), respectively. Eight out of the 17 patients (47.1%) developed acute kidney injury. Two patients with acute TIN had to start hemodialysis that was discontinued after 1 and 2 months, respectively, due to the recovery of renal function. All patients underwent treatment with corticosteroids and\/or immunosuppressants.\nDISCUSSION: Although it is not possible to conclusively determine whether there is a causal relationship between SARS-CoV-2 vaccination and new-onset nephropathies, based on the appearance of UA and\/or renal insufficiency shortly after vaccination, we hypothesize that the immune response to the COVID-19 vaccine may be a trigger of nephropathies. Therefore, our results highlight the need for pharmacovigilance. However, this report should not lead to vaccine hesitation during this pandemic as the benefits of vaccination strongly outweigh the potential risks.",

This study aimed to address how to incorporate a prior biopsy-proven diagnosis in outcome prediction.\nMETHODS: We examined the association of biopsy-proven kidney disease diagnoses with kidney failure with replacement therapy (KFRT) and all-cause death before KFRT in patients with various biopsy-proven diagnoses (n = 778, analysis A) and patients with diabetes mellitus labeled with biopsy-proven diabetic nephropathy (DN), other biopsy-proven diseases and no biopsy (n = 1117, analysis B).\nRESULTS: In analysis A, adding biopsy-proven diagnoses to the GFR-albuminuria (GA) classification improved the prediction of 8-year incidence of KFRT and all-cause death significantly regarding integrated discrimination improvement and net reclassification index. Fine-Gray (FG) models with KFRT as a competing event showed significantly higher subdistribution hazard ratios (SHRs) for all-cause death in nephrosclerosis {4.12 [95% confidence interval (CI) 1.11-15.2)], focal segmental glomerulosclerosis [3.77 (95% CI 1.09-13.1)]} and membranous nephropathy (MN) [2.91 (95% CI 1.02-8.30)] than in immunoglobulin A nephropathy (IgAN), while the Cox model failed to show significant associations. Crescentic glomerulonephritis had the highest risk of all-cause death [SHR 5.90 (95% CI 2.05-17.0)]. MN had a significantly lower risk of KFRT than IgAN [SHR 0.45 (95% CI 0.24-0.84)].

Increasing evidence reported the role of the overactivated complement system in the pathogenesis of DKD. Whether renal complement depositions are associated with renal outcomes of DKD in T2DM is of interest.\nMETHODS: A total of 213 biopsy-proven DKD patients with T2DM were retrospectively recruited. Clinical and pathological data of the patients were analyzed. Kaplan-Meier analysis and Cox regression analysis were performed to explore predictors of end-stage renal disease (ESRD).\nRESULTS: During a median follow-up of 23.0 (12.0, 39.0) months, 100\/213 (46.9%) patients progressed to ESRD. C3c and C1q deposition were observed in 133\/213 (62.4%) and 45\/213 (21.1%) patients, respectively.

This study was undertaken to see the effect of this pandemic on subjects requiring renal biopsy.\nMATERIALS AND METHOD: Renal biopsies performed during the COVID 19 pandemic between April 2020 and December 2020 (Group 1) were compared with those in pre-COVID period between June 2019 and February 2020 (Group 2). Indication of biopsies, syndromic diagnosis and all baseline laboratory characteristics were retrieved from the hospital records.\nRESULTS: 130 and 191 patients were biopsied in groups 1 and 2, respectively. Patients in group 1 were younger compared with group 2 (32.55 ± 15.60 and 36.37 ± 16.96 years, respectively, p value 0.038). The mean serum creatinine value in group 1 was significantly higher than in group 2 (3.21 ± 2.08 and 2.68 ± 2.02 mg\/dl respectively, p value: 0.023). Group 1 comprises a significantly higher percentage of rapidly progressive renal failure patients (RPRF) (39.3 vs 28, p value 0.046). A higher percentage of nephrotics was biopsied in group 2 vs group 1 (46.9 vs 30.4 respectively, p value 0.008). The treatment protocol remained similar in both the groups. Evaluation of the transplant biopsies revealed a nonsignificant higher number of rejections in group 1 (11 out of 18) as compared to group 2 (5 out of 16), p value 0.100. Combined rejection saw a lesser use of rATG in group 1.\nCONCLUSION: COVID pandemic induced restrictive measures could have led to selective high risk patients with RPRF as presumptive diagnosis and higher creatinine values getting biopsied. Higher rejections were noticed in transplant recipients pointing towards the need of establishing a more efficient support system for managing such patients.",

We aim to identify urinary miRNA targets for the diagnosis of IgAN by including hypertensive nephrosclerosis (HTN) as a control group. Methods In the development cohort, we performed complete miRNA profiling of urinary sediment in 33 patients with IgAN, 9 with HTN, and 9 healthy controls (CTL). Potential miRNA targets were quantified by a separate validation cohort of 72 IgAN, 34 HTN, and 20 healthy controls. Results In the development cohort, we identified 6 miRNA targets with urinary levels significantly increased in IgAN as compared to both HTN and CTL. In the validation study, all 6 miRNA targets remained increased than the other groups, although the result of miR-345 did not reach statistical significance. The area-under-curve of the receiver operating characteristic (ROC) curve for urinary mi-106a level for the diagnosis of IgAN was 0.742 (p < 0.0001), and the diagnostic performance was not further improved by having additional miRNA targets.

Each biopsy was stained for EXT1 and NCAM1 and scored as positive or negative. Histopathologic and clinical data were reviewed.\nRESULTS: We identified 31 patients with a clinical diagnosis of SLE and at least two kidney biopsies with MLN. A total of 28 patients (90%) showed concordant staining for EXT1 and NCAM1 in both biopsies; 8 patients (26%) were EXT1 positive and NCAM1 negative, 18 patients (58%) were EXT1 negative and NCAM1 negative and 2 patients (7%) were EXT1 negative and NCAM1 positive. A total of three patients (10%) had discordant EXT1 staining between their first and last biopsies; two patients (7%) were EXT1 positive in their first biopsy and EXT1 negative in the last biopsy and one patient (3%) was EXT1 negative in his first biopsy and EXT1 positive in the last biopsy.

        "Abstract":"BACKGROUND AND OBJECTIVES: Kidney biopsy (KB) is the \"gold standard\" for the diagnosis of nephropathies and it is a diagnostic tool that presents a low rate of complications. Nowadays, biobank collections of renal tissue of patients with proven renal pathology are essential for research in nephrology. To provide enough tissue for the biobank collection, it is usually needed to obtain an extra kidney core at the time of kidney biopsy. The objective of our study is to evaluate the complications after KB and to analyze whether obtaining an extra core increases the risk of complications.\nMATERIAL AND METHODS: Prospective observational study of KBs performed at Vall d'Hebron Hospital between 2019 and 2020. All patients who accepted to participate to our research biobank of native kidney biopsies were included to the study. Clinical and laboratory data were reviewed and we studied risk factors associated with complications.\nRESULTS: A total of 221 patients were included, mean age 56.6 (±16.8) years, 130 (58.8%) were men, creatinine was 2.24 (±1.94) mg\/dL, proteinuria 1.56 (0.506-3.590) g\/24 h, hemoglobin 12.03 (±2.3) g\/dL, INR 0.99 (±0.1), and prothrombin time (PT) 11.86 (±1.2) s. A total of 38 patients (17.2%) presented complications associated with the procedure: 13.1% were minor complications, 11.3% ( = 25) required blood transfusion, 1.4% ( = 3) had severe hematomas, 2.3% ( = 5) required embolization, and 0.5% ( = 1) presented arterio-venous fistula. An increased risk for complication was independently associated with obtaining a single kidney core (vs. 2 and 3 cores) ( = 0.021).\nCONCLUSIONS: KB is an invasive and safe procedure with a low percentage of complications. Obtaining an extra kidney core for research does not increase the risk of complications during the intervention, which remains low in concordance with previously published reports.",

        "Abstract":"INTRODUCTION: It is not fully elucidated whether preeclampsia (PE) is a marker or a cause of chronic kidney disease (CKD). To test the hypothesis of a biphasic relationship between PE and CKD, we assessed PE prevalence in women who underwent a kidney biopsy.\nMETHODS: This retrospective, observational study recruited patients who underwent a kidney biopsy after delivery in 2014 to 2019 in 3 Italian Centers (Cagliari, Bari, Messina); low-risk pregnancies observed in Cagliari served as controls. A history of PE was assessed on the clinical charts and by phone interview.\nRESULTS: In the biopsy cohort (379 pregnancies, 205 patients; 38 PE in 32 patients), kidney biopsy shows clustering in the first 5 years after PE (11 of 32). Pre-existing CKD was detected in 8 of 11 of these cases. Focal-segmental glomerulosclerosis (FSGS) and complex lesions were found in 12 of 32 biopsies. The odds ratio (OR) of having had a PE episode, compared with 561 low-risk pregnancies, was 10.071 (95% CI: 4.859-20.875;  < 0.001); multiparity maintained a protective effect (OR: 0.208). The delivery-to-biopsy time was significantly shorter in women with PE, both considering the first or the last PE versus the first or last delivery in patients with or without PE episodes. The characteristics of PE did not differ as compared with low-risk controls.\nCONCLUSION: Within the limitation of the retrospective design, our study, quantifying the association between needing a kidney biopsy and history of PE, suggests a biphasic pattern, with a peak in the first 5 years after delivery (probably due to pre-existing diseases) and a later increase, suggesting that PE may have later played as one hit in a multiple-hit pathogenesis.",

Therefore, this analysis sought to develop and validate a predictive model incorporating both clinical and pathological markers to predict renal outcomes in patients with biopsy-confirmed DN.\nMETHODS: A predictive nomogram was developed based upon data pertaining to 194 patients with biopsy-confirmed DN. The prognostic relevance of individual clinicopathological variables was assessed through univariate and multivariate Cox regression analyses. A prognostic nomogram was then developed and validated based upon concordance (C)-index values and calibration curves. Internal validation was conducted through bootstrap resampling, while the clinical utility of this model was assessed via a decision curve analysis (DCA) approach.\nRESULTS: Nephrotic-range 24-h proteinuria, late-stage CKD, glomerular classification III-IV, and IFTA score 2-3 were all identified as independent predictors of poor renal outcomes in DN patients and were incorporated into our final nomogram. Calibration curves revealed good agreement between predicted and actual 3- and 5-year renal survival in DN patients with the C-index value for this nomogram at 0.845 (95% CI: 0.826-0.864). DCA revealed that our nomogram was superior to models based solely upon clinical indicators.\nCONCLUSION: A predictive nomogram incorporating clinical and pathological indicators was developed and validated for the prediction of renal survival outcomes in patients with biopsy-confirmed DN.

Kidney elastography is a noninvasive imaging modality that might be used to assess tissue fibrosis.

In all patients, the transverse and sagittal elastography measurements were made using a sonoelastography device before the biopsy. The total histological score was calculated.\nRESULTS: Fifty-seven native kidney patients with proteinuria were included in the study. Patients were divided into two groups according to the presence ( = 6) and absence of fibrosis ( = 51) as detected by kidney biopsy. A significant correlation was found between the presence of fibrosis detected by biopsy and elastography outcomes ( = .046,  = .192). A significant correlation was found between the urea and creatinine levels and transverse elastography measurements ( = .036,  = .240). No correlation was observed between the transverse elastography measurements and total histological score consisting of glomerular, vascular, and tubular scores ( = .006,  = .967).\nCONCLUSION: The findings of our study suggest a significant relationship between the elastography measurements and interstitial fibrosis. Because of the high negative predictive value (91%), we suggest that elastography should mainly be used as an exclusion test for the presence of fibrosis.

        "Published":"2022-02-11",
        "Abstract":"Kidney involvement, termed lupus nephritis (LN), develops in 35-60% of patients with systemic lupus erythematosus, often early during the disease course. When not treated promptly and efficiently, LN may lead to rapid and severe loss of kidney function, being the reason why it is considered one of the most severe lupus manifestations. Despite improved pharmacotherapy, 5-20% of LN patients develop end-stage kidney disease within ten years from the LN diagnosis. While the principal ground of LN therapy is prevention of renal function worsening, resembling a race against nephron loss, consensual agreement upon outcome measures and clinically meaningful short- and long-term targets of LN therapy have yet to be determined. Literature points to the importance of inclusion of tissue-based approaches in the determination of those targets, and evidence accumulates regarding the importance of per-protocol repeat kidney biopsies in the evaluation of the initial phase of therapy and prediction of long-term renal prognosis. The latter leads to the hypothesis that the information gleaned from repeat biopsies may contribute to optimised therapeutic decision making, and, therefore, increased probability to attain complete renal response in the short term, and a more favourable renal prognosis within a longer prospect. The multinational project ReBioLup was recently designed to serve as a key contributor to form evidence about the role of per-protocol repeat biopsies in a randomised fashion and aspires to unify the global LN community towards improved kidney and patient survival.",

Only a limited number of studies have reported etiology-based differences in the clinical and\/or histopathological properties and kidney outcomes of the biopsy-proven TIN.\nMETHODS: Patients with biopsy-proven TIN identified from 2005 to 2016 in five hospitals were categorized based on the etiologies and were retrospectively analyzed in relation to the clinicopathological findings and kidney outcomes.\nRESULTS: Among 4815 biopsy cases screened, 153 Japanese TIN patients were identified, of whom 139 patients with ≥ 6 months of follow-up data (median 58 years old, 45.3% female, median 31.5 months follow-up) were further analyzed. TIN was drug-induced in 32.4%, autoimmune-related in 24.5%, of unknown etiology in 27.3% and other disease-related in 15.8%. Non-steroidal anti-inflammatory drugs and antibiotics were major causative drugs in drug-induced TIN, and IgG4-related disease, Sjögren's syndrome and sarcoidosis were common in autoimmune-related TIN. Among etiology groups, drug-induced TIN showed advanced AKI with elevated serum creatinine (sCr) and increased C-reactive protein levels at the diagnosis. TIN patients with autoimmune diseases showed less-severe AKI, but were more frequently treated with corticosteroids than others. Tubulointerstitial injury expansion in biopsy specimens was comparable among the groups. Complete or partial kidney function recovery at 6 months was more frequent in drug-induced and autoimmune-related TIN than in others. sCr levels at 6 months were similar among the groups.\nCONCLUSIONS: This largest case series study of the biopsy-proven TIN in Japan provides detailed information regarding both etiology-based clinicopathological properties and kidney outcomes.",

        "Abstract":"['post hoc', 'p', 'p', 'p', 'p', 'p', 'p', 'p', 'p']\nBone biopsy is still the gold standard tool to evaluate either trabecular or cortical bone, though the quantitative computed tomography of the vertebrae (QCT), a non-invasive technique, could be useful to evaluate bone structure in patients with chronic kidney disease (CKD). Cortical bone microstructure derangements have been associated with poor outcomes in the general population. An association between trabecular bone density, assessed by QCT, and bone volume and microarchitecture by histomorphometry, has been previously documented. This relationship has not yet been fully evaluated in cortical bone in the CKD scenario. The aim of this study was to evaluate the relationship among vertebrae density measured by QCT, structural histomorphometric parameters of cortical bone and biochemical and hormonal data in 50 CKD stage 2-5ND patients. This was a  analysis of a cross-sectional study where cortical porosity and cortical thickness were analyzed in undecalcified bone samples from the iliac crest. The cortical bone density was obtained by QCT from the thoracic vertebrae. The patients were 52 ± 10 years, 68% men, 30% diabetes and the estimated glomerular filtration rate 34 ± 16 mL\/min\/1.73 m2. Cortical porosity was 4.6% (3.6; 6.6) and cortical thickness was 578.4 ± 151.8 μm, while cortical bone density was 149.2 ± 58.3 HU. Cortical density correlated with cortical thickness ( = 0.001) but not with cortical porosity ( = 0.30). Higher porosity was associated with older age ( = 0.02), higher levels of PTH ( = 0.04) and lower renal function ( = 0.03), while smaller thickness was associated with higher levels of PTH ( = 0.02). Lower density was associated with older age ( = 0.02) and higher levels of PTH ( = 0.01). In conclusion, cortical bone density measured by QCT was able to mirror the cortical thickness of bone biopsy in pre-dialysis CKD patients. In addition, PTH action on cortical bone can be already seen in this population.",

The ultimate goal of IFTA calculation is an estimation of the functional nephritic area. However, the clinical gold standard of estimation by pathologist is imprecise, primarily due to the overwhelming number of tubules sampled in a standard kidney biopsy. Artificial intelligence algorithms could provide significant benefit in this aspect as their high-throughput could identify and quantitatively measure thousands of tubules in mere minutes. Towards this goal, we use a custom panoptic convolutional network similar to Panoptic-DeepLab to detect tubules from 87 WSIs of biopsies from native diabetic kidneys and transplant kidneys. We measure 206 features on each tubule, including commonly understood features like tubular basement membrane thickness and tubular diameter. Finally, we have developed a tool which allows a user to select a range of tubule morphometric features to be highlighted in corresponding WSIs. The tool can also highlight tubules in WSI leveraging multiple morphometric features through selection of regions-of-interest in a uniform manifold approximation and projection plot.",

        "Abstract":"The outcome after living kidney donation was assumed to be comparable to that of the general population. However, recent register studies reveal negative changes in kidney function, quality of life and fatigue. Avoiding methodological issues of previous studies, the Safety of the Living Kidney Donor (SoLKiD) cohort study analyzed the outcome of donors in a multicenter and interdisciplinary fashion. Donor data were collected pre-donation and two-, six- and 12-months post-donation in 20 German transplantation centers. Primary parameters were kidney function, quality of life, and fatigue. Secondary endpoints were blood pressure, hemoglobin, hemoglobin A1c, body mass index, depression and somatization. Parameters were analyzed with non-parametric statistical tests and a mixed model regression for changes in time, their clinical relevance and interaction encompassing 336 donors with mean age of 52 years. Most of the physical secondary parameters, depression, and quality of life showed little or no changes and regained their pre-donation level. Kidney function decreased significantly with a 37% loss of glomerular filtration rate and an increase of donors with chronic kidney disease stage 3 from 1.5% pre-donation to about 50%. Donors consistently showed increased fatigue and somatization. Mental fatigue increased from 10.6% to 28.1%. The main influencing factors for decreased kidney function and increased fatigue were their respective pre-donation levels, and donor age for kidney function and subject stress level in fatigue. Thus, our study showed that a significant number of donors developed clinically relevant changes in physical and mental health and emphasizes the urgent need to inform potential donors about these risks.",

        "Abstract":"Ultrasound-guided percutaneous renal biopsy (PRB) has revolutionized the clinical practice of nephrology in the last decades. PRB remains an essential tool for the diagnosis, prognosis, and therapeutic management of several renal diseases and for the assessment of renal involvement in systemic diseases. In this study, we examine the different applications and provide a review of the current evidence on the periprocedural management of patients. PRB is recommended in patients with significant proteinuria, hematuria, acute kidney injury, unexpected worsening of renal function, and allograft dysfunction after excluding pre- and post-renal causes. A preliminary ultrasound examination is needed to assess the presence of anatomic anomalies of the kidney and to identify vessels that might be damaged by the needle during the procedure. Kidney biopsy is usually performed in the prone position on the lower pole of the left kidney, whereas in patients with obesity, the supine antero-lateral position is preferred. After preparing a sterile field and the injection of local anesthetics, an automatic spring-loaded biopsy gun is used under ultrasound guidance to obtain samples of renal parenchyma for histopathology. After the procedure, an ultrasound scan must be performed for the prompt identification of potential early bleeding complications. As 33% of complications occur after 8 h and 91% occur within 24 h, the ideal post-procedural observation time is 24 h. PRB is a safe procedure and should be considered a routine part of the clinical practice of nephrology.",

        "Abstract":"BACKGROUND: In Fabry disease, the presence of globotriaosylceramide (GL3) deposits in various kidney cells leads to progressive renal dysfunction. However, kidney biopsy studies in patients with Fabry disease are limited. In the present study, the pathologic findings of patients with Fabry nephropathy receiving enzyme replacement therapy (ERT) and untreated patients without albuminuria were investigated.\nMETHODS: The present study included 15 patients with Fabry disease who underwent renal biopsy while receiving ERT (group 1: n = 9, age 19-58 years, two males and seven females) or before ERT initiation (group 2: n = 6, age 11-66 years, one male and five females). All patients in group 2 were normoalbuminuric.\nRESULTS: Group 1 showed improved clinical symptoms, such as acroparesthesia. The ERT duration was 1.2 to 8 years and seven of the nine patients showed GL3 deposits in various kidney cells and segmental foot process effacement (FPE) of podocytes. GL3 deposits and FPE were not observed in the two remaining patients in group 1. Group 2 showed segmental FPE and podocyte GL3 deposits. Most patients in group 2 also showed GL3 deposits in the mesangium, endothelium, or tubular epithelium.\nCONCLUSION: The study results showed that segmental FPE and GL3 deposits can persist in Fabry nephropathy despite ERT. In addition, segmental FPE and GL3 deposits were observed in various kidney cells in normoalbuminuric patients with Fabry disease. These findings indicated that kidney biopsies at baseline and follow-up evaluation of Fabry nephropathy are essential for timely ERT initiation and ERT response assessment.",

In our study, we aimed to explore the expression of Gal-3 in biopsy-proven patients, and we tested the hypothesis that chronic kidney disease (CKD) leads to upregulation of plasma Gal-3 expression in corresponding biopsy findings and RNA sequencing analysis.  In 249 patients (male\/female: 155\/94, age: 57.2 ± 16.3 years) who underwent kidney biopsy, plasma levels of Gal-3 were measured to estimate the association of renal fibrosis. Relationships between plasma Gal-3 levels, estimated glomerular filtration rate (eGFR) and renal histology findings were also assessed. We further examined the gene expression of Gal-3 in RNA-sequencing analysis in biopsy-proven patients.  Compared to patients without CKD, CKD patients had higher levels of plasma Gal-3 (1,016.3 ± 628.1 pg\/mL vs. 811.6 ± 369.6 pg\/ml;  = 0.010). Plasma Gal-3 was inversely correlated with eGFR ( = 0.005) but not with proteinuria. Higher Gal-3 levels were associated with interstitial fibrosis, tubular atrophy and vascular intimal fibrosis. RNA-sequencing analysis showed the upregulation of Gal-3 in fibrotic kidney biopsy samples, and the differentially expressed genes were mainly enhanced in immune cell activation and the regulation of cell-cell adhesion.  Plasma Gal-3 levels are inverse correlated with eGFR but positively correlated with renal fibrosis, which may be involved in the immune response and associated pathways.

        "Abstract":"BACKGROUND: Computer-aided diagnosis (CAD) systems based on medical images could support physicians in the decision-making process. During the last decades, researchers have proposed CAD systems in several medical domains achieving promising results. CAD systems play an important role in digital pathology supporting pathologists in analyzing biopsy slides by means of standardized and objective workflows. In the proposed work, we designed and tested a novel CAD system module based on image processing techniques and machine learning, whose objective was to classify the condition affecting renal corpuscles (glomeruli) between sclerotic and non-sclerotic. Such discrimination is useful for the biopsy slides evaluation performed by pathologists.\nRESULTS: We collected 26 digital slides taken from the kidneys of 19 donors with Periodic Acid-Schiff staining. Expert pathologists have conducted the slides preparation, digital acquisition and glomeruli annotations. Before setting the classifiers, we evaluated several feature extraction techniques from the annotated regions. Then, a feature reduction procedure followed by a shallow artificial neural network allowed discriminating between the glomeruli classes. We evaluated the workflow considering an independent dataset (i.e., processing images not used in the training procedure). Ten independent runs of the training algorithm, and evaluation, allowed achieving MCC and Accuracy of 0.95 (± 0.01) and 0.99 (standard deviation < 0.00), respectively. We also obtained good precision (0.9844 ± 0.0111) and recall (0.9310 ± 0.0153).\nCONCLUSIONS: Results on the test set confirm that the proposed workflow is consistent and reliable for the investigated domain, and it can support the clinical practice of discriminating the two classes of glomeruli. Analyses on misclassifications show that the involved images are usually affected by staining artefacts or present partial sections due to slice preparation and staining processes. In clinical practice, however, pathologists discard images showing such artefacts.",

        "Published":"2021-10-21",
        "Abstract":"Kidney biopsy is the cornerstone for the diagnosis of immunoglobulin A nephropathy (IgAN). The immunofluorescence technique evidences the IgA deposits in the glomeruli; the routine histology shows degree of active and chronic renal lesions. The spectrum of renal lesions is highly variable, ranging from minor or no detectable lesions to diffuse proliferative or crescentic lesions. Over the past three decades, renal transcriptomic studies have been performed on fresh or frozen renal tissue, and formalin-fixed paraffin-embedded kidney tissue specimens obtained from archival histological repositories. This paper aims to describe (1) the transcriptomic profiles of the kidney biopsy and (2) the potential urinary biomarkers that can be used to monitor the follow-up of IgAN patients. The use of quantitative Real-Time Polymerase Chain Reaction (qRT-PCR), microarrays and RNA-sequencing (RNA-seq) techniques on renal tissue and separated compartments of the nephron such as glomeruli and tubule-interstitium has clarified many aspects of the renal damage in IgAN. Recently, the introduction of the single-cell RNA-seq techniques has overcome the limitations of the previous methods, making that it is possible to study the whole renal tissue without the dissection of the nephron segments; it also allows better analysis of the cell-specific gene expression involved in cell differentiation. These gene products could represent effective candidates for urinary biomarkers for clinical decision making. Finally, some of these molecules may be the targets of old drugs, such as corticosteroids, renin-angiotensin-aldosterone blockers, and new drugs such as monoclonal antibodies. In the era of personalized medicine and precision therapy, high-throughput technologies may better characterize different renal patterns of IgAN and deliver targeted treatments to individual patients.",

        "Published":null,
        "Abstract":"BACKGROUND: Sarcoidosis is characterized by granulomatous inflammation in multiple organs. Renal involvement is rare, and granulomatous tubulointerstitial nephritis (TIN) is the predominant histologic feature. TIN is also a hallmark of tubulointerstitial nephritis and uveitis (TINU) syndrome. Diagnoses of both sarcoidosis and TINU syndrome are usually made by exclusion and by combining clinical and histological findings, and often remain misdiagnosed. The aim of this retrospective study was to determine the characteristics of renal sarcoidosis and TINU syndrome in Slovenia in the last decade (2010 - 2020).\nMATERIALS AND METHODS: A thorough search of the national database of renal biopsies from January 2010 to December 2020 was performed. Inclusion criteria were TIN and a clinical history of either sarcoidosis or TINU syndrome. To compare the characteristics of our cohort with others, we also reviewed the global literature reported since 2010.\nRESULTS: 13 patients (9 female, 4 male) were included in our study. Indications for kidney biopsy were acute kidney injury (n = 8), acute exacerbation of chronic kidney disease (n = 4), and proteinuria (n = 1). Seven patients had clinical and histological evidence of sarcoidosis, and 6 patients were classified as having TINU syndrome. All patients were treated with corticosteroids. Of the 13 patients, 11 had improved kidney function 6 months after treatment, and proteinuria decreased in 9 patients. One patient was on dialysis at the time of diagnosis and remained so thereafter.\nCONCLUSION: Renal sarcoidosis and TINU syndrome are rare but important causes of kidney injury, with a favorable long-term prognosis if properly diagnosed and treated in a timely manner.",

        "Published":"2021-10-08",
        "Abstract":"The use of bone biopsy for histomorphometric analysis is a quantitative histological examination aimed at obtaining quantitative information on bone remodeling, structure and microarchitecture. The labeling with tetracycline before the procedure also allows for a dynamic analysis of the osteoblastic activity and mineralization process. In the nephrological setting, bone biopsy is indicated to confirm the diagnosis of subclinical or focal osteomalacia and to characterize the different forms of renal osteodystrophy (ROD). Even if bone biopsy is the gold standard for the diagnosis and specific classification of ROD, the use of this approach is very limited. The main reasons for this are the lack of widespread expertise in performing or interpreting bone biopsy results and the cost, invasiveness and potential pain associated with the procedure. In this regard, the sedation, in addition to local anesthesia routinely applied in Italian protocol, significantly reduces pain and ameliorates the pain perception of patients. Concerning the lack of widespread expertise, in Italy a Hub\/Spokes model is proposed to standardize the analyses, optimizing the approach to CKD patients and reducing the costs of the procedure. In addition, new tools offer the possibility to evaluate the osteogenic potential or the ability to form bone under normal and pathological conditions, analyzing mesenchymal stem cells and their ability to differentiate in the osteogenic lineage. In the same way, circulating microRNAs are suggested as a tool for exploring osteogenic potential. The combination of different diagnostic approaches and the optimization of the bioptic procedure represent a concrete solution to spread the use of bone biopsy and optimize CKD patient management.",

        "Abstract":"['P', 'P', 'R', 'P']\n2\nCardiovascular morbidity is a major problem in patients with chronic kidney disease (CKD) and endothelial dysfunction (ED) is involved in its development. The luminal side of the vascular endothelium is covered by a protective endothelial glycocalyx (eGC) and indirect evidence indicates eGC loss in CKD patients. We aimed to investigate potential eGC loss and ED in skin biopsies of CKD patients and their association with inflammation and volume overload. During living kidney transplantation procedure, abdominal skin biopsies were taken from 11 patients with chronic kidney disease stage 5 of whom 4 were treated with hemodialysis and 7 did not receive dialysis treatment. Nine healthy kidney donors served as controls. Biopsies were stained and quantified for the eGC marker Ulex europaeus agglutinin-1 (UEA1) and the endothelial markers vascular endothelial growth factor-2 (VEGFR2) and von Willebrand factor (vWF) after double staining and normalization for the pan-endothelial marker cluster of differentiation 31. We also studied associations between quantified log-transformed dermal endothelial markers and plasma markers of inflammation and hydration status. Compared to healthy subjects, there was severe loss of the eGC marker UEA1 ( < 0.01) while VEGFR2 was increased in CKD patients, especially in those on dialysis ( = 0.01). For vWF, results were comparable between CKD patients and controls. Skin water content was identical in the three groups, which excluded dermal edema as an underlying cause in patients with CKD. The dermal eGC\/ED markers UEA1, VEGFR2, and vWF all associated with plasma levels of NT-proBNP and sodium (all   > 0.29 and  < 0.01), except for vWF that only associated with plasma NT-proBNP. This study is the first to show direct histopathological evidence of dermal glycocalyx loss and ED in patients with CKD. In line with previous research, our results show that ED associates with markers of volume overload arguing for strict volume control in CKD patients.",

        "Abstract":"Fabry disease (FD) is a rare X-linked lysosomal storage disorder caused by mutations in the galactosidase A (GLA) gene that result in deficiency of α-GLA activity, leading to major organ failure and premature mortality. According to different disease courses, FD can be divided into classical and nonclassical phenotypes. The nonclassical FD phenotype is always absent of characteristic symptoms, which makes identifying it challenging. This article presents a 49-year-old man with a 10-year history of proteinuria and decreased glomerular filtration rate. An electrocardiogram showed a complete right bundle branch block and abnormal Q waves in high lateral, accompanied by dramatically elevated ST segment. Consequently, a renal biopsy was performed. Vacuolation was found in many podocytes in light microscopic examinations. Similarly, a myelin-like structure was detected by electron microscopy. Pathological findings were most consistent with FD. Consequently, genetic analysis, p.R301Q (c.902G>A [p.Arg301Gln]), confirmed the FD diagnosis. Angiotensin receptor blocker and traditional Chinese medicine, but not enzyme replacement therapy, were prescribed due to financial constraints. The patient had stabilization of kidney disease 6 months later. The case showed that renal biopsy should be performed in patients with cardiac and renal symptoms, which could contribute toward the correct diagnosis for nonclassical FD type.",

        "Abstract":"OBJECTIVES: ANCA-associated vasculitis (AAV) is a rare autoimmune disorder that commonly involves the kidney. Early identification of kidney involvement, assessing treatment-response and predicting outcome are important clinical challenges. Here, we assessed the potential utility of interval kidney biopsy in AAV.\nMETHODS: In a tertiary referral centre with a dedicated vasculitis service, we identified patients with AAV who had undergone interval kidney biopsy, defined as a repeat kidney biopsy (following an initial biopsy showing active AAV) undertaken to determine the histological response in the kidney following induction immunosuppression. We analysed biochemical, histological and outcome data, including times to kidney failure and death for all patients.\nRESULTS: We identified 57 patients with AAV who underwent at least one interval kidney biopsy (59 interval biopsies in total; median time to interval biopsy ∼130 days). Of the 59 interval biopsies performed, 24 (41%) patients had clinically suspected active disease at time of biopsy which was confirmed histologically in only 42% of cases; 35 (59%) patients were in clinical disease-remission, and this was correct in 97% of cases. The clinician's impression was incorrect in one in four patients. Hematuria at interval biopsy did not correlate with histological activity. Interval biopsy showed fewer acute lesions and more chronic damage compared with initial biopsy and led to immunosuppressive treatment-change in 75% (44\/59) of patients. Clinical risk prediction tools tended to operate better using interval biopsy data.\nCONCLUSION: Interval kidney biopsy is useful for determining treatment-response and subsequent disease management in AAV. It may provide better prognostic information than initial kidney biopsy and should be considered for inclusion into future clinical trials and treatment protocols for patients with AAV.",

We aimed to analyze the clinicopathological findings of kidney diseases in the elderly (≥ 65 years), in comparison with their younger counterparts (aged 16 - 64 years).\nMATERIALS AND METHODS: The data at the time of renal biopsy were obtained by reviewing medical records and the biopsy reports of the patients retrospectively. The data at the time of renal biopsy were obtained by reviewing medical records and the biopsy reports of the patients who underwent renal biopsy at Bakirkoy Dr. Sadi Konuk Education and Research Hospital. Demographic characteristics, clinical syndrome at presentation, and histopathological diagnosis of all patients were recorded.\nRESULTS: Among the 750 renal biopsies, 93 were performed in elderly patients, which constitutes 12.4% of the biopsies. The mean age of the patients was 71.7 ± 5.4 years, and 62.4% were male. The most common indication for renal biopsy was nephrotic syndrome (NS) in elderly and younger age groups (45.2% vs. 40%). The most frequent histopathological diagnosis was membranous glomerulonephritis (MGN). According to the clinical presentation, MGN (42.8%) was the leading cause of NS, and almost 1\/3 of the patients with acute or rapidly progressive renal failure were found to have pauci-immune glomerulonephritis (GN). In comparison with renal biopsy results of younger patients, MGN and pauci-immune GN were more prevalent, but IgA nephropathy, lupus nephritis, and acute tubular necrosis were less common in elderly patients.\nCONCLUSION: Clinical presentation and the frequency of certain renal pathologies differ with age. The relatively high prevalence of potentially curative kidney diseases in the elderly indicates the importance of renal biopsy in these patients.",

        "Abstract":"Introduction Chronic kidney disease (CKD) has become a health concern with an extensive burden on incidence and prognosis. While the increasing lifespan contributes to a higher incidence of CKD among the elderly, the diagnostic picture in this age group is complicated by senescence-related changes. A better understanding of the etiology and progression of the disease warrants renal biopsy in such patients. This study aims to explore the histopathological spectrum of native renal biopsies leading to CKD in elderly patients in a tertiary care hospital. Methods Among the list of patients who had undergone renal biopsy at our institute from January 2015 to March 2020, elderly patients aged ≥ 60years were chosen for this study. Their demographic details, lab investigations and histopathological reports were collected. The sex distribution and prevalence of different renal diseases was calculated. The subjects were classified into four broad diagnostic groups - primary glomerular disease, diabetic nephropathy, hypertensive nephropathy, and tubulointerstitial disease. The estimated glomerular filtration rate (eGFR) values were calculated and used to stage chronic kidney disease in these patients. Statistical analysis was carried out to find a correlation between diagnostic groups and CKD presence and between serum C3 values and immunofluorescence for the same on biopsy. Results One hundred thirty-two patients formed the study sample with a male to female ratio of 1.28:1, showing a slight male predominance. The most common diagnostic group was primary glomerular disease (46%), among which focal segmental glomerulosclerosis (FSGS) was the most common entity (12%). 47.7% and 66.6% of patients in the study sample showed elevated serum blood urea nitrogen (BUN) and creatinine values, respectively. 86% of our study sample had low eGFR values, and the majority (35%) of the patients were classified under CKD stage 3. CKD incidence was high among patients with primary glomerular diseases, but no significant statistical correlation was found. 43.5% of all IF positive cases showed low serum C3 values and established a positive correlation between IF and serum C3 values. Conclusion There is no statistically significant correlation of the four diagnostic groups to the CKD. CKD in the elderly may be multifactorial, and a collaborative study across the nations may be needed to further evaluate the etiology.",

In this study, we investigate the application of 'increased expression of thoroughly validated gene transcripts\/classifiers strongly associated with AMR' as diagnostic criteria.\nMETHOD: We used quantitative real-time polymerase chain reaction for 10 genes associated with AMR in a retrospective cohort of 297 transplant biopsies, including biopsies that met the full diagnostic criteria for AMR, even without molecular data (AMR, n = 27), biopsies that showed features of AMR, but that would only meet criteria for AMR with increased transcripts [suspicious for AMR (AMRsusp), n = 49] and biopsies that would never meet criteria for AMR (No-AMR, n = 221).\nRESULTS: A 10-gene AMR score trained by a receiver-operating characteristic to identify AMR found 16 cases with a high score among the AMRsusp cases (AMRsusp-high) that had significantly worse graft survival than those with a low score (AMRsusp-low; n = 33). In both univariate and multivariate Cox regression analysis, the AMR 10-gene score was significantly associated with an increased hazard ratio (HR) for graft loss (GL) in the AMRsusp group (HR = 1.109, P = 0.004 and HR = 1.138, P = 0.012, respectively), but not in the whole cohort. Net reclassification index and integrated discrimination improvement analyses demonstrated improved risk classification and superior discrimination, respectively, for GL when considering the gene score in addition to histological and serological data, but only in the AMRsusp group, not the whole cohort.\nCONCLUSIONS: This study provides evidence that a gene score strongly associated with AMR helps identify cases at higher risk of GL in biopsies that are suspicious for AMR but do not meet full criteria.",

Cox proportional hazards models tested associations of plasma KIM-1 levels with future kidney failure and death.\nRESULTS: In the BKBC Study, higher plasma KIM-1 levels were associated with more severe acute tubular injury, tubulointerstitial inflammation, and more severe mesangial expansion after multivariable adjustment. Participants with diabetic nephropathy, glomerulopathies, and tubulointerstitial disease had significantly higher plasma KIM-1 levels after multivariable adjustment.

There was no statistically significant association of plasma KIM-1 levels with death in either cohort.\nLIMITATIONS: Generalizability and unmeasured confounding.\nCONCLUSIONS: Plasma KIM-1 is associated with underlying tubulointerstitial and mesangial lesions and progression to kidney failure in 2 cohort studies of individuals with kidney diseases.",

        "Abstract":"INTRODUCTION: Chronic kidney disease (CKD) patients infected with COVID-19 are at risk of serious complications such as hospitalization and death. The prognosis and lethality of COVID-19 infection in patients with established kidney disease has not been widely studied.\nMETHODS: Data included patients who underwent kidney biopsy at the Vall d'Hebron Hospital between January 2013 and February 2020 with COVID-19 diagnosis during the period from March 1 to May 15, 2020.\nRESULTS: Thirty-nine (7%) patients were diagnosed with COVID-19 infection. Mean age was 63 ± 15 years and 48.7% were male. Hypertension was present in 79.5%, CKD without renal replacement therapy in 76.9%, and cardiovascular disease in 64.1%. Nasopharyngeal swab was performed in 26 patients; older (p = 0.01), hypertensive (p = 0.005), and immunosuppressed (p = 0.01) patients, those using RAS-blocking drugs (p = 0.04), and those with gastrointestinal symptoms (p = 0.02) were more likely to be tested for CO-VID-19. Twenty-two patients required hospitalization and 15.4% died. In bivariate analysis, mortality was associated with older age (p = 0.03), cardiovascular disease (p = 0.05), chronic obstructive pulmonary disease (p = 0.05), and low hemoglobin levels (p = 0.006). Adjusted Cox regression showed that low hemoglobin levels at admission had 1.81 greater risk of mortality.\nCONCLUSIONS: Patients with CO-VID-19 infection and kidney disease confirmed by kidney biopsy presented a mortality of 15.4%. Swab test for COVID-19 was more likely to be performed in older, hypertensive, and immunosuppressed patients, those using RAS-blocking drugs, and those with gastrointestinal symptoms. Low hemoglobin is a risk factor for mortality.",

        "Published":"2021-01-15",
        "Abstract":"BACKGROUND: Chronic kidney disease (CKD) is one of the pathologies with the greatest impact on the public health system. Over the last few decades, the relevance of CKD in Mexico has increased, with associated overwhelming costs for care of renal disease. There are no reliable CKD statistics in Mexico.\nMETHODOLOGY: In June 2018, the government of Aguascalientes called on all Health Institutions to create a state registry of treated end-stage renal disease (ESRD). In the same system, a renal biopsy result registry included all the native kidney biopsies obtained in the state of Aguascalientes since 2012. We herein describe the prevalence, incidence and characteristics of the patients included in the CKD and renal biopsy registry in the state of Aguascalientes.\nRESULTS: As of April 2020, the state has documented 2827 patients on renal replacement therapy (RRT), 1877 on dialysis and 950 that have been transplanted. The prevalence of patients on dialysis is 1326 per million population (p.m.p.), and if transplanted individuals are included, it is 1997 p.m.p. The incidence of treated ESRD in 2019 was 336 p.m.p. ( = 474) in individuals with an average age of 45.6 years (standard deviation ±18), and in a higher proportion of men (61%). There is a bimodal distribution of the age at which RRT was initiated. The first and the most significant peaks are between the ages of 20 and 40 years and are usually the result of CKD of unknown cause (73%). The second peak is between 50 and 70 years of age, and CKD is usually the result of diabetes mellitus and systemic arterial hypertension (59.6%). Since January 2012, 423 biopsies have been recorded. The patient's ages were between 20 and 30 years ( = 112), and the most frequent diagnosis was focal segmental glomerulosclerosis (FSGS) (54%).\nCONCLUSIONS: The prevalence of treated ESRD in the state of Aguascalientes is high. The disease mostly afflicts young people between 20 and 40 years of age, and there is a clear male predominance. In this age group, the main clinical diagnosis is CKD of unknown origin, and the most frequent biopsy diagnosis was FSGS.",

        "Abstract":"Roughly 3% of patients worldwide with a new diagnosis of type 2 diabetes mellitus (T2DM) already have an overt nephropathy at diagnosis and about 20-30% of the remaining ones develop a complication of this kind later in life. The early identification of kidney disease in diabetic patients is important as it slows its progression, which is important not only because this reduces the need for renal replacement therapy, but also because it decreases the high rate of mortality and morbidity associated with a reduction in kidney function. The increasing prevalence of type 2 diabetes and the consequent greater probability of finding different types of kidney diseases in diabetic patients frequently gives rise to overlapping diagnoses, a definition encompassing the differential diagnosis between diabetic and non-diabetic kidney disease. The issue is made more complex by the acknowledgement of the increasing frequency of presentations of what is termed \"diabetic kidney disease\" without relevant proteinuria, in particular in T2DM patients. Distinguishing between diabetes related and non-diabetes related forms of kidney disease in diabetic patients is not only a semantic question, as different diseases require different clinical management. However, while the urologic and macrovascular complications of diabetes, as well as overlapping parenchymal damage, can be diagnosed by means of imaging studies, often only a kidney biopsy will make a differential diagnosis possible. In fact, the coexistence of typical diabetic lesions, such as nodular glomerulopathy or glomerulosclerosis, with different glomerular, vascular and tubulo-interstitial alterations has been extensively described, and an analysis of the dominant histological pattern can contribute to determining what therapeutic approach should be adopted. However, due to the high frequency of kidney diseases, and to the fact that T2DM patients are often affected by multiple comorbidities, a kidney biopsy is not generally performed in T2DM patients. What follows is a review aiming to discuss the diagnostic work-up, on the base of clinical, laboratory and imaging criteria, and evaluate the present indications and alternatives to renal biopsy.",

Clinicopathological findings at diagnosis were analyzed for 3,463 pediatric (age < 15 years) and 6,532 AYA (age 15-30 years) patients.\nRESULTS: Although chronic nephritic syndrome was the most common clinical diagnosis at age > 5 years, nephrotic syndrome was the most frequent diagnosis at age < 4 years. The most common pathological diagnosis as classified by pathogenesis in pediatric patients was primary glomerular disease (except IgA nephropathy), whereas IgA nephropathy was increased in AYA patients. Mesangial proliferative glomerulonephritis was the most common pathological diagnosis as classified by histopathology in both pediatric and AYA patients. Minor glomerular abnormalities were the most frequent histopathologic diagnoses of nephrotic syndrome in childhood, but their frequency decreased with age.\nCONCLUSION: To the best of our knowledge, this is the first report of clinicopathological features of pediatric and AYA patients in a large nationwide registry of renal biopsy.

        "Abstract":"PURPOSE: To investigate the association between urinary complement proteins and renal outcome in biopsy-proven diabetic nephropathy (DN).\nMETHODS: Untargeted proteomic and Kyoto Encyclopedia of Genes and Genomes (KEGG) functional analyses and targeted proteomic analysis using parallel reaction-monitoring (PRM)-mass spectrometry was performed to determine the abundance of urinary complement proteins in healthy controls, type 2 diabetes mellitus (T2DM) patients, and patients with T2DM and biopsy-proven DN. The abundance of each urinary complement protein was individually included in Cox proportional hazards models for predicting progression to end-stage renal disease (ESRD).\nRESULTS: Untargeted proteomic and functional analysis using the KEGG showed that differentially expressed urinary proteins were primarily associated with the complement and coagulation cascades. Subsequent urinary complement proteins quantification using PRM showed that urinary abundances of C3, C9, and complement factor H (CFAH) correlated negatively with annual estimated glomerular filtration rate (eGFR) decline, while urinary abundances of C5, decay-accelerating factor (DAF), and CD59 correlated positively with annual rate of eGFR decline. Furthermore, higher urinary abundance of CFAH and lower urinary abundance of DAF were independently associated with greater risk of progression to ESRD. Urinary abundance of CFAH and DAF had a larger area under the curve (AUC) than that of eGFR, proteinuria, or any pathological parameter. Moreover, the model that included CFAH or DAF had a larger AUC than that with only clinical or pathological parameters.\nCONCLUSION: Urinary abundance of complement proteins was significantly associated with ESRD in patients with T2DM and biopsy-proven DN, indicating that therapeutically targeting the complement pathway may alleviate progression of DN.",

        "Abstract":"BACKGROUND: Only a few studies reporting the long-term outcome of children with idiopathic tubulointerstitial nephritis (TIN) and uveitis syndrome (TINU) are available. We studied the long-term kidney and ocular outcome in a nationwide cohort of children with TIN or TINU.\nMETHODS: All patients followed up for a minimum of 1 year by a paediatrician and an ophthalmologist were enrolled. The data on plasma creatinine (P-Cr), estimated glomerular filtration rate (eGFR), proteinuria, hypertension and uveitis were collected retrospectively.\nRESULTS: Fifty-two patients were studied. Median age at time of diagnosis was 13.1 (1.8-16.9) years and median follow-up time was 5.7 (1.1-21.2) years. Forty-five (87%) patients were initially treated with glucocorticoids. The median of the maximum P-Cr was 162 μmol\/l (47-1,016) and that of eGFR 47 ml\/min\/1.73m (8-124). Uveitis was diagnosed in 33 patients (63%) and 21 (40%) patients developed chronic uveitis. P-Cr normalised in a median of 2 months. Eleven (21%) patients had nephritis recurrence during or after discontinuation of glucocorticoids. At the latest follow-up, 13 (25%) patients had eGFR < 90 ml\/min\/1.73m (median 83; 61-89 ml\/min\/1.73m). Six patients had tubular proteinuria; all presented with TIN without uveitis. Seven (13%) patients were hypertensive. Eleven (21%) patients had uveitis. One patient developed uraemia and was later transplanted.\nCONCLUSIONS: Our study questions the previously reported good long-term kidney and ocular outcome of patients with TIN\/TINU. Decreased kidney function and\/or ocular co-morbidities may persist for several years; thus, both kidney and ocular follow-up for at least 1 year is warranted.

        "Abstract":"['+', '+', '-', '+', '+', '+', '+', '+']\nDelayed graft function (DGF) is a strong risk factor for development of interstitial fibrosis and tubular atrophy (IFTA) in kidney transplants. Quantitative assessment of inflammatory infiltrates in kidney biopsies of DGF patients can reveal predictive markers for IFTA development. In this study, we combined multiplex tyramide signal amplification (mTSA) and convolutional neural networks (CNNs) to assess the inflammatory microenvironment in kidney biopsies of DGF patients (n = 22) taken at 6 weeks post-transplantation. Patients were stratified for IFTA development (<10% versus ≥10%) from 6 weeks to 6 months post-transplantation, based on histopathological assessment by three kidney pathologists. One mTSA panel was developed for visualization of capillaries, T- and B-lymphocytes and macrophages and a second mTSA panel for T-helper cell and macrophage subsets. The slides were multi spectrally imaged and custom-made python scripts enabled conversion to artificial brightfield whole-slide images (WSI). We used an existing CNN for the detection of lymphocytes with cytoplasmatic staining patterns in immunohistochemistry and developed two new CNNs for the detection of macrophages and nuclear-stained lymphocytes. F1-scores were 0.77 (nuclear-stained lymphocytes), 0.81 (cytoplasmatic-stained lymphocytes), and 0.82 (macrophages) on a test set of artificial brightfield WSI. The CNNs were used to detect inflammatory cells, after which we assessed the peritubular capillary extent, cell density, cell ratios, and cell distance in the two patient groups. In this cohort, distance of macrophages to other immune cells and peritubular capillary extent did not vary significantly at 6 weeks post-transplantation between patient groups. CD163 cell density was higher in patients with ≥10% IFTA development 6 months post-transplantation (p < 0.05). CD3CD8\/CD3CD8 ratios were higher in patients with <10% IFTA development (p < 0.05). We observed a high correlation between CD163 and CD4GATA3 cell density (R = 0.74, p < 0.001). Our study demonstrates that CNNs can be used to leverage reliable, quantitative results from mTSA-stained, multi spectrally imaged slides of kidney transplant biopsies.",

The indications for renal biopsy were represented by the clinical features: nephrotic syndrome, nephritic syndrome, asymptomatic urinary abnormalities, acute kidney injury, and chronic kidney disease of unknown etiology.\nRESULTS: During the past 8 years, the annual incidence of renal biopsies was constant, albeit this incidence remained lower than in other countries. Nephrotic syndrome was the most common indication for renal biopsy (47.6%). Primary glomerulonephritis (GN) was the most common diagnosis in each of the three periods, followed by secondary GN. Vascular nephropathy and TIN were constant as a proportion from the overall biopsies in each of the three periods. The membranoproliferative GN (24.4%) and membranous nephropathy (MN) (21.9%) were the most prevalent primary GN, while lupus nephritis (LN) was the most common secondary glomerular disease in young female patients (7.5%).

        "Abstract":"AIMS: Patients undergoing dialysis, even those without coronary artery disease or valvular abnormalities, sometimes present with reduced heart function, which resembles dilated cardiomyopathy (DCM). This condition is known as uraemic cardiomyopathy (UCM). The mechanisms of UCM development are not fully understood. Previous studies demonstrated that the balance between placental growth factor (PlGF) and fms-like tyrosine kinase-1 (Flt-1) is correlated with renal function, and PlGF\/Flt-1 signalling is involved in the development of cardiovascular diseases in patients with chronic kidney disease. This study was conducted to evaluate the pathogenesis of UCM and clarify the differences in the mechanisms of UCM and DCM by using human endomyocardial biopsy and blood samples.\nMETHODS AND RESULTS: The clinical and pathological features of 30 patients on dialysis with reduced cardiac function [left ventricular ejection fraction (LVEF) ≤50%] (UCM group; mean age: 58.5 ± 9.4 years and LVEF: 39.1 ± 7.2%), 196 DCM patients (DCM group; mean age: 62.7 ± 14.0 years and LVEF: 33.5 ± 8.8%) as controls with reduced cardiac function (LVEF ≤ 45%), and 21 patients as controls with normal cardiac function (control group; mean age: 56.2 ± 19.3 years and LVEF: 67.5 ± 6.7%) were analysed. The percentage of the interstitial fibrosis area in the UCM group was greater than that in the DCM group (P = 0.045). In UCM patients, the percentage of the interstitial fibrosis area was positively correlated with the duration of renal replacement therapy (P < 0.001). The number of infiltrated CD68-positive macrophages in the myocardium and expression of monocyte chemoattractant protein-1 (MCP-1) in cardiomyocytes were significantly greater in the UCM group than in the other groups (P < 0.001, respectively). Furthermore, while the serum level of soluble form of Flt-1, an endogenous inhibitor of PlGF, in the UCM group was lower compared with that in the DCM group (P < 0.001), the serum levels of PlGF and PlGF\/soluble form of Flt-1 ratio and plasma level of MCP-1 in the UCM group were higher than those in the DCM group (P < 0.001, respectively).\nCONCLUSIONS: These results suggest that activated PlGF\/Flt-1 signalling and subsequent macrophage-mediated chronic non-infectious inflammation via MCP-1 in the myocardium are involved in the pathogenesis of UCM.",

Conversely, the prevalence of abnormal albuminuria in the A\/- + A\/A group was lower than in the -\/- group (4.92% vs. 19.35%, p = 0.001). Additionally, the mean u-ACR levels were lower among carriers of the A\/- or A\/A genotypes with coexisting hypertension or diabetes, than among those with the -\/- genotype. The risk of abnormal albuminuria (adjusted-odds ratio 0.16, p = 0.001) remained significantly lower in the A\/- + A\/A group after adjustment for established renal risk factors and histologic severity of NAFLD.\nCONCLUSION: HSD17B13 rs72613567: A allele is associated with a lower risk of having abnormal albuminuria, but not with lower eGFR or urinary\/serum NGAL levels, in patients with biopsy-proven NAFLD.",

The kidney is a main target organ of TAFRO syndrome but the kidney histopathology associated with TAFRO syndrome is yet to be completely defined. We report 3 TAFRO syndrome cases with different clinical courses in which kidney biopsies were performed. In all 3 cases, kidney biopsies showed similar glomerular lesions of diffuse global swelling of the endothelium and expansion of subendothelial spaces, consistent with severe glomerular endothelial injury. Case 3 showed an additional finding of focal tubulointerstitial injury characterized by marked plasma cell infiltration, which was absent in the other 2 cases. Clinical symptoms in cases 1 and 2, which had lower disease severity scores of TAFRO syndrome, were effectively treated with the administration of corticosteroids or a combination of corticosteroids and cyclosporine A. Case 3, with a higher disease severity score, had an aggressive clinical course that was refractory to corticosteroids and tocilizumab; the patient ultimately died of multiple organ failure. In all 3 cases, kidney biopsy provided indications for the diagnosis process and clinical management of TAFRO syndrome.",

        "Abstract":"BACKGROUND: Growth Differentiation Factor-15 (GDF15) is a member of the TGF-β superfamily. Increased serum GDF15 has been associated with increased risk of chronic kidney disease (CKD) progression. However, no prior studies have addressed the significance of urinary GDF15 in adult CKD.\nMETHODS: We measured serum and urinary GDF15 in a prospective cohort of 84 patients who underwent kidney biopsy and assessed their association with outcomes (survival, kidney replacement therapy) during a follow-up of 29 ± 17 months.\nRESULTS: There was a statistically significant correlation between serum and urine GDF15 values. However, while serum GDF15 values increased with decreasing glomerular filtration rate, urinary GDF15 did not. Immunohistochemistry located kidney GDF15 expression mainly in tubular cells, and kidney GDF15 staining correlated with urinary GDF15 values. Urine GDF15 was significantly higher in patients with a histologic diagnosis of diabetic nephropathy than in diabetic patients without diabetic nephropathy. This was not the case for serum GDF15. Both serum and urine GDF15 were negatively associated with patient survival in multivariate models. However, when both urine and serum GDF15 were present in the model, lower urine GDF15 predicted patient survival [B coefficient (SEM) - 0.395 (0.182) p 0.03], and higher urine GDF15 predicted a composite of mortality or kidney replacement therapy [0.191 (0.06) p 0.002], while serum GDF15 was not predictive. Decision tree analysis yielded similar results. The area under the curve (AUC) of the receiver operating curve (ROC) for urine GDF15 as a predictor of mortality was 0.95 (95% CI 0.89-1.00, p < 0.001).\nCONCLUSIONS: In conclusion, urinary GDF15 is associated with kidney histology patterns, mortality and the need for renal replacement therapy (RRT) in CKD patients who underwent a kidney biopsy.",

        "Abstract":"AIM: Kidney biopsy (KBx) is the gold standard for evaluation of kidney disease, but is associated with a higher risk of complications in patients with reduced glomerular filtration rate (GFR). We studied the safety and utility of KBx in patients with eGFR <30 ml\/min\/1.73 m .\nMETHODS: Consecutive adult patients with eGFR <30 ml\/min\/1.73 m , who were planned for a KBx and consented to participate were prospectively enrolled. Patients with solitary\/transplant kidney or acute kidney injury were excluded. Haemoglobin was checked on the day of KBx and repeated 18-24 h later along with a screening ultrasound. Post-KBx complications were noted and their risk-factors analysed. The utility of the KBx was graded as effecting significant, some, or no change to subsequent management.\nRESULTS: Of the 126 patients included, 75% were male, 27.7% were diabetic, and the median eGFR was 13.5 ml\/min\/1.73m . Major complications occurred in 5.6%. Peri-renal haematomas were detected in 37.3%, and haematomas ≥2 cm were significantly more frequent in those with eGFR <15 ml\/min\/1.73 m (29.2% vs. 13%, p = .032). Dialysis was a risk factor, while pre KBx blood transfusion, diabetes and higher serum albumin were protective against any complication. KBx was more likely to make a significant difference in management in those with eGFR 15-29 ml\/min\/1.73m (44.1% vs. 11.1%, p < .001). Increasing age, lower serum creatinine and albumin were independently associated with KBx utility.\nCONCLUSION: KBx is relatively safe in severe kidney disease but its risk to benefit balance needs to be carefully considered when eGFR is <15 ml\/min\/1.73m .",

This article starts with ultrasound-guided renal biopsy navigation training, optimizes puncture path planning, and puncture training assistance. The augmented reality technology, combined with renal puncture surgery training was studied. This paper develops a prototype ultrasound-guided renal biopsy surgery training system, which improves the accuracy and reliability of the system training.

We revisit the fundamental tool of diagnosing kidney disease, renal biopsy, in cancer patients with renal manifestation.\nMETHODS: Patients who received renal biopsy from July 2015 to July 2019 were analyzed. Primary outcomes included end-stage renal disease (ESRD), mortality, and catastrophic outcome defined as either ESRD or mortality. A Cox proportional hazards model and Kaplan-Meier technique were used to assess the association with outcome measurements and survival analyses. Immunosuppression after renal biopsy and response to the treatment were evaluated.\nRESULTS: Among the 77 patients, the median age was 66 years (interquartile range [IQR] 59-73 years) and 46 (59.7%) were male. At the time of renal biopsy, 57 patients (74%) had various degrees of renal insufficiency. Tubulointerstitial damage score, quantified by renal pathology, were associated with higher hazards of ESRD (hazard ratio [HR], 1.77; 95% confidence interval [95% CI], 1.20 to 2.61; P = 0.004) and catastrophic outcome (HR, 1.30; 95% CI, 0.99 to 1.70; P = 0.058). The response rate to immunosuppression was lower in those diagnosed with tubulointerstitial nephritis (1 of 4 patients, 25%) than those with glomerulopathy (10 of 20 patients, 50%).\nCONCLUSION: Renal biopsy may improve diagnostic accuracy and assist in treatment guidance of cancer patients with renal manifestation. Renal biopsy should be encouraged with clinical indication. Collaboration between oncologists and nephrologists is of paramount importance to provide more comprehensive care for caner patients.",

Forty-seven patients (80.9% men) with COVID-19 who underwent a kidney biopsy between March 08 and May 19, 2020 were included. Median age was 63 years IQR [52-69]. Comorbidities included hypertension (66.0%), diabetes mellitus (27.7%), obesity (27.7%), history of chronic kidney (25.5%), cardiac (38.6%) and respiratory (27.3%) diseases. Initial symptoms were fever (85.1%), cough (63.8%), shortness of breath (55.3%), and diarrhea (23.4%). Almost all patients developed acute kidney injury (97.9%) and 63.8% required renal replacement therapy. Kidney biopsy showed two main histopathological patterns, including acute tubular injury in 20 (42.6%) patients, and glomerular injury consisting of collapsing glomerulopathy and focal segmental glomerulosclerosis in 17 (36.2%) patients. Two (4.3%) patients had acute vascular nephropathy, while eight (17%) had alternative diagnosis most likely unrelated to COVID-19. Acute tubular injury occurred almost invariably in the setting of severe forms of COVID-19, whereas patients with glomerular injury had various profiles of COVID-19 severity and collapsing glomerulopathy was only observed in patients harboring a combination of APOL1 risk variants. At last follow-up, 16 of the 30 patients who initially required dialysis were still on dialysis, and 9 died. The present study describes the spectrum of kidney lesions in patients with COVID-19.

A total of 387 cases of both gender, aged up to 16 years, diagnosed having GN on the basis of renal biopsies by light microscopy (LM) and IF findings, were included. Outcome as remission, partial remission, no remission with stable kidney disease, no remission with progressive kidney disease and end-stage kidney disease (ESKD) were computed. Chi square test was applied to see the correlation of IF findings and outcome by taking p value less than 0.05 as statistically significant.\nRESULTS: Focal segmental glomerulosclerosis (FSGS) was found to be the commonest histopathology finding noted in 158 (40.8%) followed by mesangioproliferative GN 74 (19.1%) and membranous nephropathy 42 (10.9%). Complete remission was observed in 145 (37.5%) cases whereas ESKD was seen in 26 (6.7%). Distinct pattern of IF findings were shown when distribution of IF findings were seen with respect to all study variables (p value < 0.001).

ESKD was seen among 14 (25.9%) IgM positive and three (33.3%) IgA positive cases.\nCONCLUSION: Immunofluorescence proved an important diagnostic tool in reaching the exact diagnosis in various types of GN. Distinct correlation between IF findings and clinical course of various types of GN was observed. IF negative cases had better outcome and was not having progressive course of disease so prognosis remained better than IF positive cases in this study.",

This study investigated the clinicopathologic features and the related risk factors for long-term renal survival in older patients with diabetic nephropathy (DN).\nMETHODS: In this retrospective observational study, 74 older patients (≥ 60 years old) with type 2 diabetes mellitus and biopsy-proven DN from 2007 to 2019 were included. Clinical data were extracted from electronic records. Renal biopsy specimens were semiquantitatively evaluated using the Renal Pathology Society (RPS) classification system. Cox proportional hazard analysis was used to estimate hazard ratios (HRs) for progression to end-stage renal disease (ESRD).\nRESULTS: During the median follow-up period of 22 months, 24 (32%) older patients progressed to ESRD. Older patients who progressed to ESRD had poorer renal function, lower hemoglobin and albumin concentrations, more severe glomerular lesions, and higher percentages of Kimmelstiel-Wilson lesions than those who did not progress to ESRD.

        "Abstract":"JBMR Plus\nThe evaluation of bone complications in chronic kidney disease (CKD) often requires a bone biopsy, the analysis of which can refine the diagnosis of bone defects. Bone histomorphometry performed on sections of the iliac crest biopsy remains the reference procedure for the quantitative assessment of bone health in CKD patients, whereas immunohistochemistry and other molecular biology analyses are indispensable tools for studying the disrupted signaling pathways. Traditionally, the whole iliac crest biopsy was included in methyl-methacrylate (MMA) and was exclusively used for bone histomorphometry to describe static, dynamic, and structural parameters. Therefore, further molecular analysis of the bone tissue or the need for tissue banking would require a second biopsy to be made, because inclusion in MMA prevents the extraction of good-quality nucleic acids. In this work, we describe a simple approach to divide a single iliac crest bone biopsy into multiple parts. This allows for simultaneous assessments of histology, immunohistochemistry, biomolecular analysis, and tissue banking while preserving the same bone surface area for histomorphometry. © 2020 American Society for Bone and Mineral Research © 2020 The Authors.  published by Wiley Periodicals LLC on behalf of American Society for Bone and Mineral Research.",

However, the potential of MRI to monitor response to therapy in kidney disease remains undescribed. In this case report, a man in his 40s with drug-resistant membranous nephropathy was addressed to ofatumumab therapy. He underwent kidney biopsy before and 2 years after treatment and repeat non-contrast-enhanced MRI of the kidney every 6 months. An age- and sex-matched healthy volunteer was included as a normal control. The patient showed a striking positive immunologic response to therapy. Repeat MRI of the kidney documented progressive kidney functional recovery, with a significant widespread increase in kidney diffusivity, assessed using diffusion-weighted imaging, paralleling the increase in glomerular filtration rate and regression of albuminuria. Renal blood flow and ultrafiltration coefficient, assessed using phase-contrast MRI, significantly increased, suggesting an increase in filtration fraction. This case report provides the first clinical evidence in support of MRI of the kidney as a tool to noninvasively monitor pathophysiologic changes occurring in response to treatment.

This study aims to highlight the clinical profile and histopathological spectrum of the elderly patient undergoing a renal biopsy.\nMATERIALS AND METHODS: This retrospective study included all patients (age ≥60 years) undergoing native renal biopsies from January 2012 to December 2017. The clinical profile, laboratory parameters, and renal biopsy findings of these patients were recorded from the case files.\nRESULTS: Out of 1656 renal biopsies performed during the study period, 230 (13.9%%) performed on the elderly were included. Mean age was 64.02 ± 7.87 years (Range: 60-87 years), and males were predominant (70.4%). The commonest indication for biopsy was nephrotic syndrome (NS) (49.6%) followed by Rapidly progressive renal failure (RPRF) (20.9%) and Acute Kidney Injury (AKI) (15.7%). The most frequent histological diagnosis was membranous nephropathy (15.2%) followed by amyloidosis (13.9%) and Focal Segmental Glomerulosclerosis (FSGS) (13.0%). The commonest cause of NS was MGN (29.8%) followed by FSGS (24.6%) and amyloidosis (22.8%). The commonest cause of nephritic syndrome was Diffuse Proliferative Glomerulonephritis (29.4%) and Membranoproliferative Glomerulonephritis (29.4%). Hypertensive nephrosclerosis (40.0%) and diabetic nephropathy (26.7%)) were the commonest histological diagnosis in the patients who underwent renal biopsy for clinical Chronic kidney disease. Crescentic GN (35.4%) and Myeloma cast nephropathy 14.6%) were the commonest cause of RPRF while Acute Tubular Necrosis (41.7%) was the commonest cause of AKI. None of the patients had major complications.\nCONCLUSION: Renal biopsy is safe in the elderly and provides a wealth of information with regards to the diagnosis and prognosis of renal disorder.",

        "Published":"2020-11-23",
        "Abstract":"BACKGROUND: TAFRO syndrome is a clinical subtype of idiopathic multicentric Castleman disease (iMCD) that is characterized by thrombocytopenia, anasarca, fever, reticulin myelofibrosis (or renal dysfunction), and organomegaly. TAFRO syndrome has only recently been described, and many clinicians are unaware of this disease, leading to delays in diagnosis and treatment. We present two patients with TAFRO syndrome in whom renal biopsies were performed.\nCASE PRESENTATION: Both patients had subacute onset and exhibited renal insufficiency, edema, anemia, thrombocytopenia, polyserositis and lymphadenopathy over the disease course. However, there were many differences in their clinical manifestations. Case 1 was a 30-year-old woman admitted due to intermittent vaginal bleeding for 3 weeks. Laboratory tests on admission showed severe renal insufficiency (creatinine: 624 μmol\/L), severe anemia (Hb: 41 g\/L), and moderate thrombocytopenia (61 × 10\/L). Case 2 was a 42-year-old man. Acute epigastric pain was his initial complaint, and computed tomography (CT) revealed retroperitoneal exudation around the pancreas. He was diagnosed with acute pancreatitis, and after treatment with a proton pump inhibitor (PPI) and somatostatin, his abdominal pain still recurred. During treatment, renal failure gradually increased, with oliguria, fever, anemia, thrombocytopenia, edema and massive ascites. Lymph node histologies were consistent with the hyaline-vascular (HV) type and mixed type, respectively, and renal histopathologies were consistent with thrombotic microangiopathy (TMA)-like renal lesions and membranoproliferative glomerulonephritis (MPGN), respectively. Their general conditions improved after glucocorticoid therapy, but their renal functions did not recover completely. On the basis of glucocorticoids, second-line treatments with tocilizumab and rituximab, respectively, were applied.\nCONCLUSIONS: The diagnosis of TAFRO syndrome is based mainly on clinical manifestations and lymph node biopsies. A reliable early diagnosis and appropriate rapid treatment are essential to improve patient outcomes. Clinicians should deepen their understanding of this disease and similar conditions. Once the disease is suspected, lymph node biopsies should be performed as soon as possible. In addition, renal biopsies should be actively performed in patients with renal involvement.",

        "Abstract":"INTRODUCTION: There are fewer reports about whether the presence of hematuria affects the progression of chronic kidney disease in patients with diabetic nephropathy. We analyzed whether microscopic hematuria in diabetic nephropathy is a risk factor for end-stage kidney disease (ESKD).\nRESEARCH DESIGN AND METHODS: The present study was a retrospective cohort study of patients with biopsy-proven diabetic nephropathy. We recruited 397 patients with diabetic nephropathy, which was confirmed by renal biopsy between June 1981 and December 2014 and followed them until October 2018 or death. Patients with microscopic hematuria before renal biopsy were defined as the hematuria group (n=91), and the remainder as the no-hematuria group (n=306). The main outcome was the occurrence of ESKD, which was defined by the requirement of permanent renal replacement therapies.\nRESULTS: The systolic and diastolic blood pressure, serum creatinine and proteinuria were significantly higher, and the estimated glomerular filtration rate was significantly lower in the hematuria group compared with the no-hematuria group. Pathological evaluations revealed that glomerular, tubulointerstitial and vascular lesions in the hematuria group were significantly more severe. During a median of 10.1 years, 44 and 52 patients developed ESKD in the hematuria group and the no-hematuria group, respectively. Survival analyses showed that the incidence of ESKD was significantly higher in the hematuria group compared with the no-hematuria group (log-rank, p<0.0001). The multivariable Cox proportional hazards models revealed a significant association between hematuria and the incidence of ESKD after adjusting for clinically relevant factors, including proteinuria and renal pathology (adjusted HR 1.64, 95% CI 1.03 to 2.60). The subgroups of men, proteinuria ≥0.5 g\/day, and systolic blood pressure ≥132 mm Hg showed a stronger association between hematuria and ESKD than their opposing subgroups.\nCONCLUSIONS: Microscopic hematuria is a risk factor for ESKD in diabetic nephropathy, independent of proteinuria and renal pathology.",

        "Abstract":"OBJECTIVES: Progressive renal disease is characterized by histological changes in the kidney and fibrosis is a common outcome. Renal biopsy is the only diagnostic tool to evaluate these histopathological changes. Pentraxin-2 (PTX-2) is an anti-inflammatory constitutive plasma protein associated with the innate immune system. Recently, as a biomarker, the circulating level of PTX-2 is shown to be decreased in chronic fibrotic diseases. In this study, we aimed to investigate the relationship between renal fibrosis severity and serum PTX-2 levels in patients undergoing renal biopsy.\nMETHODS: This cross-sectional study included 45 patients and 16 healthy individuals (HIs). The severity of renal fibrosis was evaluated according to the Banff and Sethi scoring systems by the same pathologist. PTX-2 was measured by an enzyme-linked immunosorbent assay and compared with the demographical, clinical, biochemical, and histopathological data of the patients and HIs.\nRESULTS: PTX-2 levels were lower in the biopsy group than in the HI group (p=0.12). Patients with moderate renal fibrosis had significantly lower serum PTX-2 levels than those in patients with minimal and mild fibrosis (p=0.017 and p=0.010, respectively). PTX-2 concentrations were correlated with serum albumin (r=0.30, p=0.016), and were negatively correlated with serum creatinine levels (rho=-0.42, p=0.01) and body mass index (r=-0.32, p=0.011).\nCONCLUSIONS: The results indicated that PTX-2 levels are significantly lower in patients with renal fibrosis than HIs, and declining further in patients with severe fibrosis.",

        "Abstract":"BACKGROUND: Renal tubules and interstitium are vulnerable to injury and play a central role in the progression of various chronic kidney diseases (CKDs). However, high quality epidemiologic study on the profiles of biopsy-proven tubulointerstitial lesions (TILs) is extremely limited.\nMETHODS: We conducted a retrospective renal biopsy series including 62,569 native biopsies at 1,211 hospitals across China from 2015 to 2017. The TILs, including the shedding of tube epithelial, renal tubular atrophy, renal interstitial fibrosis, edema and inflammatory infiltration, were identified from the pathological report. We analyzed the severity and chronicity of TILs stratified by gender, age groups, biopsy indications, and concurrent glomerular diseases. We also examined the correlation between TIL and glomerulosclerosis.\nRESULTS: Of 56,880 patients with biopsy-proven glomerular disease, 79.5% had TILs. Renal interstitial inflammatory infiltration was the most common type of TIL (77.7%), followed by renal tubular atrophy (56.0%) and renal interstitial fibrosis (32.8%). Severe and chronic TILs were more common in adults than in children. The three glomerular diseases with the highest proportion of moderate-to-severe and chronic TIL were diabetic nephropathy, immunoglobulin A (IgA) nephropathy and focal segmental glomerulosclerosis. The severity of TILs was moderately correlated with glomerulosclerosis score (r=0.51). Moderate-to-severe and chronic TIL were more common in southern China. After adjusting for age, sex, hospital level, region, biopsy indication and type of concurrent glomerular diseases, adults with renal arteriole injury had a six-fold higher risk of moderate-to-severe TIL [odds ratio (OR), 7.12; 95% confidence interval (CI), 6.42 to 7.91] and a three-fold higher risk of chronic TIL (OR, 4.58; 95% CI, 4.37 to 4.79).\nCONCLUSIONS: TILs were common in patients with biopsy-proven glomerular disease. The type and severity of TILs varied with age, region and concurrent glomerular diseases. Renal arteriole injury and glomerulosclerosis was associated with a significantly increased risk of TIL.",

        "Abstract":"We previously characterized the molecular changes in acute kidney injury (AKI) and chronic kidney disease (CKD) in kidney transplant biopsies, but parenchymal changes selective for specific types of injury could be missed by such analyses. The present study searched for injury changes beyond AKI and CKD related to specific scenarios, including correlations with donor age. We defined injury using previously defined gene sets and classifiers and used principal component analysis to discover new injury dimensions. As expected, Dimension 1 distinguished normal vs. injury, and Dimension 2 separated early AKI from late CKD, correlating with time posttransplant. However, Dimension 3 was novel, distinguishing a set of genes related to epithelial polarity (e.g., PARD3) that were increased in early AKI and decreased in T cell-mediated rejection (TCMR) but not in antibody-mediated rejection. Dimension 3 was increased in kidneys from older donors and was particularly important in survival of early kidneys. Thus high Dimension 3 scores emerge as a previously unknown element in the kidney response-to-injury that affects epithelial polarity genes and is increased in AKI but depressed in TCMR, indicating that in addition to general injury elements, certain injury elements are selective for specific pathologic mechanisms.

        "Abstract":"Chronic kidney disease (CKD) has been recognized as an increasingly common complication of liver transplantation (OLTx). Post-transplant renal dysfunction contributes to long-term morbidity and mortality following OLTx and is a very important issue in the management of liver transplant recipients. Its etiology is multifactorial and can be determined by kidney biopsy, which is too rarely done in this patient group. In the clinical context of patients with liver cirrhosis, accurate and reliable evaluation of the renal injury is crucial. We performed a review of kidney biopsies in patients with symptoms of CKD (proteinuria\/hematuria\/elevated creatinine) before and after liver transplantation in the published literature. Kidney biopsies were performed either before or after liver transplantation using percutaneous technique. There are few reports on transjugular kidney biopsy. Biopsy results prevented unnecessary modification of immunosuppressive therapy or selection of candidates for liver transplantation. In our opinion, kidney biopsy is a clinically relevant diagnostic approach to recognize kidney disease before and after liver transplantation, it also helps with the management of kidney disease in this population, and it is safe. Kidney biopsy should be offered more often in liver transplant patients to ensure appropriate therapy in concomitant CKD in this population.

        "Abstract":"BACKGROUND AND OBJECTIVES: Native kidney biopsies are commonly performed in the diagnosis of acute kidney diseases and CKD. Because of the invasive nature of the procedure, bleeding-related complications are not uncommon. The National Institutes of Health, National Institute of Diabetes and Digestive and Kidney Diseases-sponsored Kidney Precision Medicine Project requires that all participants undergo a kidney biopsy; therefore, the objective of this analysis was to study complication rates of native kidney biopsies performed using automated devices under kidney imaging.\nDESIGN, SETTING, PARTICIPANTS, & MEASUREMENTS: This is a systematic review and meta-analysis of the literature published from January 1983 to March 2018. The initial PubMed search yielded 1139 manuscripts. Using predetermined selection criteria, 87 manuscripts were included in the final analysis. A random effects meta-analysis for proportions was used to obtain combined estimates of complication rates. Freeman-Tukey double-arcsine transformations were used to stabilize variance as complications were rare.\nRESULTS: A total of 118,064 biopsies were included in this study. Patient age ranged from 30 to 79 years, and 45% of patients were women. On the basis of our meta-analysis, pain at the site of biopsy is estimated to occur in 4.3% of biopsied patients, hematomas are estimated to occur in 11%, macroscopic hematuria is estimated to occur in 3.5%, bleeding requiring blood transfusions is estimated to occur in 1.6%, and interventions to stop bleeding are estimated to occur in only 0.3%. Death attributed to native kidney biopsy was a rare event, occurring only in an estimated 0.06% of all biopsies but only 0.03% of outpatient biopsies. Complication rates were higher in hospitalized patients and in those with acute kidney disease. The reported complications varied on the basis of study type and geographic location.\nCONCLUSIONS: Although the native kidney biopsy is an invasive diagnostic procedure, the rates of bleeding complications are low.

        "Abstract":"AIM: Compared to Standard Criteria Donors (SCD), Expanded Criteria Donor (ECD) kidneys are associated with poorer outcomes, although pre-transplant biopsy may mitigate risks. This study assessed 5-year outcomes of deceased-donor kidney transplant recipients, comparing recipients of ECD allografts evaluated histologically to recipients of SCD and ECD kidneys assessed clinically.\nMETHODS: This is a single-centre retrospective study. From November 2005 to December 2009 (Era 1), donors were assessed clinically for suitability for kidney donation. From December 2009 to October 2017 (Era 2), kidneys from ECDs and diabetics underwent pre-transplant biopsy and were allocated based on Remuzzi score. Outcomes of Era 1 and 2 recipients were compared.\nRESULTS: ECD kidney transplantation increased from 30.4% to 40.0% from Era 1 to 2. Univariable Cox regression, stratified by transplant era, found that 5-year graft loss was highest with Era 1 ECD (HR 2.5, 95% CI 1.1-5.5, P = .027) while graft loss for Era 2 ECD recipients was similar to SCD recipients. There was no difference in 5-year recipient survival. Amongst Era 1 ECD recipients, 51.2% experienced rejection compared to 30.8-41.5% for other subgroups. Five-year eGFR was higher with Era 2 ECD at 48.4 (33.3-60.7) ml\/min\/1.73 m compared to 42.2 (35.8-57.3) ml\/min\/1.73 m for Era 1 ECD. However, these differences were not statistically significant.\nCONCLUSION: Introduction of pre-transplant biopsy assessment may be associated with improved outcomes of ECD kidney recipients such that they are now comparable to SCD kidney recipients, with benefits persisting over 5 years.",

        "Abstract":"OBJECTIVE: This study on the prevalence of diabetic nephropathy (DN) and coexistence of non-diabetic renal disease (NDRD) in a cohort of 255 non-insulin-dependent diabetes mellitus (NIDDM) patients aims to determine the value of performing renal biopsies in these patients and elucidate the factors which could affect their progression to end-stage renal disease (ESRD).\nMETHODS: Among 255 NIDDM patients, 93 had DN alone, 69 had NDRD alone, and the remaining 93 had DN plus NDRD (mixed group). The indications for renal biopsy were based on clinical suspicion of superimposed NDRD, including heavy or rapidly increasing proteinuria, renal impairment even though diabetes is of relatively short duration, rapidly declining renal function, and presence of hematuria with dysmorphic red blood cells suggesting presence of glomerulonephritis.\nRESULTS: The following were predictors of ESRD: high systolic BP at biopsy, longer duration of diabetes, heavy proteinuria, and presence of diabetic retinopathy. Comparing patients in the NDRD group with the DN group and the mixed group, the NDRD group had lower serum creatinine and higher eGFR with lower urinary proteinuria and higher serum albumin at presentation and on follow-up. Kimmelstiel-Wilson nodules were associated with a poorer prognosis leading to a higher occurrence of ESRD among patients with DN.\nCONCLUSION: Renal biopsy is of value in indicating the prognosis of NIDDM patients with DN based on the diabetic lesions. For NIDDM patients with atypical course and suspicion of associated NDRD, a renal biopsy would enable us to diagnose the underlying NDRD and offer appropriate therapy. Most nephrologists would consider renal biopsy for an NIDDM patient based on clinical indications like atypical clinical course and suspicion of an associated NDRD, but they would not perform a routine renal biopsy like for a CKD patient, unless it is for a research indication.",

        "Abstract":"The peritoneal lining of the abdominal cavity consists of a parietal and visceral sheet. The serosa is an interesting organ, which in medical practice is particularly important in the context of chronic peritoneal dialysis (PD). This method of renal replacement therapy utilizes the semipermeability of the peritoneal surface by applying PD solutions of differing osmolarity to eliminate toxic substances and regulate fluid and electrolyte equilibrium. This method is an ideal approach especially for younger patients and is very effective at least for some time. Pre-existing injury to the peritoneum, for example as a consequence of chronic renal insufficiency or associated comorbidities and inflammatory changes that develop during PD, results in a structural remodelling of the serosa. As a consequence, the filtering function of the serosa is lost and PD has to be replaced by another renal replacement therapy. Thorough knowledge of the morphology of peritoneal changes as well as of the risk factors is of paramount importance for therapeutic management and prognosis of PD patients. In order to take this into account, the German Registry In Peritoneal Dialysis (Deutsches Peritonealbiopsieregister, GRIP) was founded a few years ago, which now includes roughly 1700 biopsies, of which detailed clinical and histomorphological information was systematically acquired and collected.",

Fabry disease (FD) is an X-linked lysosomal disease caused by the deficiency of alpha-galactosidase A. The classic form of the disease is characterized by acroparesthesia, angiokeratomas, cornea verticillata, hypertrophic cardiomyopathy, strokes, and chronic kidney disease. Podocyte myelin bodies on ultrastructural examination of kidney tissue are very characteristic of FD; however some medications and other conditions may mimic this finding.\nCASE PRESENTATION: Here, we report on a female patient with chronic kidney disease (CKD), positive family history for kidney disease and kidney biopsy showing a FSGS lesion and presence of focal myelin figures within podocytes concerning for FD. However, genetic testing for FD was negative. After comprehensive clinical, biochemical, and genetic evaluation, including whole exome and RNA sequencing, she was ultimately diagnosed with NPLRD.\nCONCLUSIONS: This case illustrates the difficulties of diagnosing atypical forms of rare Mendelian kidney diseases and the role of a multidisciplinary team in an individualized medicine clinic setting in combination with state-of-the-art sequencing technologies to reach a definitive diagnosis.",

No consensus-based clinical practice guidelines have been established for patients with anorexia nervosa referred to a nephrologist.\nSTUDY DESIGN: Patients with anorexia nervosa-associated kidney disease diagnosed were analyzed retrospectively. Kidney outcomes were defined as doubling of serum creatinine level and\/or progression to end-stage kidney disease.\nSETTING & PARTICIPANTS: Patients with a history of anorexia nervosa with kidney disease, including electrolyte abnormalities, who were referred to our hospital between 1992 and 2017 were included.\nRESULTS: 14 female patients were included. The time from anorexia nervosa onset to the initial visit with a nephrologist was 17.8 years. At the first visit, median body mass index was 13.4 kg\/m, median serum creatinine level was 1.9 mg\/dL, and median serum potassium level was 2.7 mmol\/L. All patients showed hypokalemia and addictive vomiting or diuretic\/laxative abuse. During the median observation period of 3.1 years, kidney outcomes occurred in 9 patients, and 2 died due to their anorexia nervosa. 4 patients underwent kidney biopsy. The kidney biopsy findings of these patients included hypertrophy of the juxtaglomerular apparatus, advanced glomerular collapse, and interstitial fibrosis, consistent with ischemic kidney injury and hypokalemic nephropathy.\nLIMITATIONS: The sample size was small, and kidney function was assessed based on serum creatinine levels in patients with anorexia nervosa with low muscle mass.\nCONCLUSIONS: Most patients with anorexia nervosa referred to nephrologists had kidney disease at the time of the first visit.

        "Abstract":"INTRODUCTION: To prevent bleeding after native kidney biopsy (NKB), nephrologists often prescribe desmopressin, especially for patients with reduced estimated glomerular filtration rate (eGFR) at risk of uremia-related platelet dysfunction. However, only 1 randomized study has suggested a beneficial effect for desmopressin in patients with eGFR ≥60 ml\/min per 1.73 m. This retrospective cohort study aimed to evaluate desmopressin effect on postbiopsy bleeding in all patients, regardless of eGFR and other comorbidities.\nMETHODS: In this retrospective cohort study, all adult patients who underwent an NKB from April 1, 2013, to April 30, 2018, in a tertiary hospital were identified. The association between desmopressin use and bleeding complications, including hemoglobin fall, transfusion, hematoma, symptomatic hematoma, urgent radiologic study, and hypotension, was analyzed using multivariable logistic regression models.\nRESULTS: A total of 413 native kidney biopsies were studied, 79% of which were performed after receiving desmopressin. Patients receiving desmopressin had worse chronic kidney disease (eGFR 28 vs. 45 ml\/min per 1.73 m;  < 0.001) and were more often hospitalized (48% vs. 32%;  = 0.009). Despite higher bleeding risk, patients using desmopressin had a similar likelihood of symptomatic hematomas (odds ratio [OR], 0.39; 95% confidence interval [CI], 0.13-1.14) and a lower need for urgent radiologic studies (OR, 0.33; 95% CI, 0.11-0.98).\nCONCLUSION: Patients at higher risk of bleeding using desmopressin before kidney biopsy had bleeding complications similar to those not using desmopressin. These results highlight potential important clinical and financial benefits of desmopressin use before kidney biopsy.",

The Brazilian Registry of Bone Biopsy (REBRABO) is an electronic database that includes renal osteodystrophy (RO) data. We aimed to describe the epidemiological profile of RO in a sample of CKD-MBD Brazilian patients and understand its relationship with outcomes.\nMETHODS: Between August 2015 and March 2018, 260 CKD-MBD stage 3-5D patients who underwent bone biopsy were followed for 12 to 30 months. Clinical-demographic, laboratory, and histological data were analyzed. Bone fractures, hospitalizations, and death were considered the primary outcomes.\nRESULTS: Osteitis fibrosa, mixed uremic osteodystrophy, adynamic bone disease, osteomalacia, osteoporosis, and aluminum (Al) accumulation were detected in 85, 43, 27, 10, 77, and 65 patients, respectively. The logistic regression showed that dialysis vintage was an independent predictor of osteoporosis (OR: 1.005; CI: 1.001-1.010; p = 0.01). The multivariate logistic regression revealed that hemodialysis treatment (OR: 11.24; CI: 1.227-100; p = 0.03), previous parathyroidectomy (OR: 4.97; CI: 1.422-17.241; p = 0.01), and female gender (OR: 2.88; CI: 1.080-7.679; p = 0.03) were independent predictors of Al accumulation; 115 patients were followed for 21 ± 5 months. There were 56 hospitalizations, 14 deaths, and 7 fractures during follow-up. The COX regression revealed that none of the variable related to the RO\/turnover, mineralization and volume (TMV) classification was an independent predictor of the outcomes.\nCONCLUSION: Hospitalization or death was not influenced by the type of RO, Al accumulation, or TMV classification. An elevated prevalence of osteoporosis and Al accumulation was detected.",

        "Abstract":"BACKGROUND: Little is known about the rate and predictors of finding lesions of monoclonal gammopathy (MG) of renal significance (MGRS) on kidney biopsy specimens among patients with MG.\nMETHODS: We reviewed the medical records from 2013 to 2018 at the Mayo Clinic in Rochester, Minnesota, to identify patients with MG and whether they had undergone a kidney biopsy. In a more select group of patients with MG from 2017 to 2018, we conducted a review of records to determine how many had underlying CKD, which of those with CKD had undergone a kidney biopsy, and reasons for deferring a kidney biopsy.\nRESULTS: Between 2013 and 2018, we identified 6300 patients who had MG, 160 (2.5%) of whom had undergone a kidney biopsy. Of the 160 patients, 64 (40%) had an MGRS lesion; amyloid light chain amyloidosis, the most common finding, accounted for nearly half of these lesions. In the non-MGRS group comprising 96 patients, 23 had arteriosclerosis, the most common finding. In multivariate analysis, strong predictors of finding an MGRS lesion included the presence of an elevated free light chain ratio, proteinuria, and hematuria. Among 596 patients with CKD and MG from 2017 to 2018, 62 (10.4%) underwent a kidney biopsy. Kidney biopsy was deferred for 70 patients (20%); for 62 of the 70, the diagnosis was already known, and eight were not candidates for therapy. Younger age and higher proteinuria and serum creatinine levels increased the likelihood that the patient would undergo a kidney biopsy.\nCONCLUSIONS: Proteinuria ≥1.5 g\/d, hematuria, and an elevated free light chain ratio increase the likelihood of finding MGRS, and a kidney biopsy should be highly considered in such patients.",

Whether monitoring of de novo DSA (dnDSA) paired with systematic kidney biopsy should become routine remains to be established.\nMETHODS: A retrospective multicentric study (9 French kidney transplant units of the Spiesser group) included patients without graft dysfunction biopsied because of the presence of dnDSA (One Lambda, mean fluorescence intensity [MFI], >1000).\nRESULTS: One hundred twenty-three patients (85 male\/38 female; mean age, 49.5 ± 13.1 y old) were biopsied after the detection of a dnDSA, 65.3 months (median) after kidney transplantation. Graft function was stable within 3 months before biopsy (estimated glomerular filtration rate, 55.3 ± 18.9 mL\/min\/1.73 m). Fifty-one subclinical AMRs (sAMRs) (41.4%) were diagnosed, of which 32 (26%) active and 19 (15.5%) chronic active sAMR. Seventy-two biopsies revealed no AMR (58.5%). Predictive factors associated with the diagnosis of active sAMR were MFI of immunodominant DSA >4000, MFI of the sum of DSA >6300, age of the recipient <45 years old, and the absence of steroids at biopsy. The presence of proteinuria >200 mg\/g was predictive of chronic active sAMR. The decrease of estimated glomerular filtration rate at 5 years post-biopsy was significantly higher in patients with acute sAMR (-25.2 ± 28.3 mL\/min\/1.73 m) and graft survival significantly lower.\nCONCLUSIONS: Performing a kidney graft biopsy for the occurrence of dnDSA without renal dysfunction leads to the diagnosis of a sAMR in over 40% of cases.

None of our patients have had COVID-19, although more than 50% of them were complicated with other comorbidities, and over 40% were currently using immunosuppressive treatments. Face-to-face clinic visits were interrupted in 836 (71.82%) participants. Medicine adjustments and routine laboratory examinations were delayed or made irregular in about 60% of patients. To continue their follow-ups, 255 (21.90%) patients utilized telemedicine, and about 80% of them were satisfied with the experience. The proportion of telemedicine users was significantly higher in patients with immunosuppressive treatments than those without (31.88% vs. 17.12%,  < 0.001).\nCONCLUSION: The risk of COVID-19 was mitigated in patients with CKD and other co-existing risk factors when proper protection was utilized. The routine medical care was disrupted during the pandemic, and telemedicine could be a reasonable alternative method.",

        "Abstract":"OBJECTIVES: Currently, there is limited data regarding the outcomes of lupus nephritis (LN) with moderate to severe renal failure at presentation (defined by low glomerular filtration rate; GFR <30 mL\/min).\nMETHODS: Sixty-four patients with biopsy-proven LN and estimated GFR (eGFR) <30 mL\/min were prospectively analyzed. Outcome measure of persistently low eGFR, end-stage renal disease (ESRD) or death at 365 days were grouped as Major Adverse Kidney Events (MAKE365).\nRESULTS: Diagnosis of lupus was simultaneous with onset of renal disease in 60% of cases. Histologically, 82.3% (n = 51) were class IV, the median serum creatinine was 4 mg\/dL (interquartile range [IQR] 3.1-5.9 mg\/dL), median eGFR was 13.75 mL\/min (IQR 9.25-19 mL\/min) and 42.2% (n = 27) required dialysis at presentation. Induction regimens included National Institute of Health (68.2%), Eurolupus protocol (10.9%) and mycophenolate mofetil (8%). Over 365 days, 23 (37.5%) subjects died, while 41 (62.5%) survived. The majority of deaths were due to infection and sepsis (14\/23). Among the survivors, 70.7% had good renal outcome, 12.1% had persistently low GFR (<30 mL\/min), while 17% developed ESRD. In this group, treatment response rate was 84.6% (complete response 25.6%, partial response 59%). Those with a better renal function at presentation had a good treatment response (100% vs. 40%). Altogether, n = 35 (54.6%) were included in the MAKE365 category. Between the renal survival group (n = 29) versus the MAKE365 group (n = 35) there was no difference in clinical or histological parameters.\nCONCLUSION: The current treatment protocols had a good response rate in patients with LN even with severe kidney injury at presentation.

Few sites are currently carrying out this procedure, with limited literature existing on the indications, complications and diagnostic yield thereof. The aim of the study is to analyse the indications, diagnostic yield, safety and complications of percutaneous transjugular renal biopsies in our site over the last 15 years.\nMATERIAL AND METHODS: Retrospective descriptive study of all transjugular renal biopsies performed in our site, the Hospital Vall d'Hebron, between 2003 and 2018. For this, an exhaustive review of the clinical records of patients subjected to this procedure during the study period was conducted.\nRESULTS: 56 TRBs were performed during the study period. Out of the patients, 31 were men (55.4%) and 25 were women (44.6%), with a median age of 62 years (IQ range 25-75 [52.5-69.5]). More than half presented with haematuria at the time of biopsy, with a median creatinine of 2.69 mg\/dL (IQ 25-75 [1.7-4.3]) and median proteinuria at 24 hours of 2000 mg (IQ 25-75 [0.41-4.77]).The mean systolic blood pressure (SBP) and diastolic blood pressure (DBP) were 140 +\/- 26 mmHg and 75 +\/- 15 mmHg, respectively. The biopsy was carried out owing to acute kidney failure in 19 patients, chronic kidney disease in 12 patients and nephrotic syndrome in 10 patients; in 15 patients it was carried out for other reasons. The most frequent TRB indication was technical impossibility in 16 of 56 cases (including infracostal kidneys, obesity and COPD), alterations in haemostasis (n = 6), thrombocytopenia (n = 5) and solitary kidney (n = 7). 12.5% of the biopsies were hepato-renal. Histological diagnoses were obtained in two thirds of the renal biopsies. The average number of cylinders obtained was 2.5 ± 1.3, with the average number of glomeruli being 6.6 ± 6.2. The most frequent histological diagnoses were IgA nephropathy, membranoproliferative glomerulonephritis and thrombotic microangiopathy. Three major complications were observed: fornix rupture and two transfusion requirements due to bleeding and subcapsular hematoma.\nCONCLUSIONS: In our site, TRB allowed for a histological diagnosis in 2\/3 of patients for whom percutaneous ultrasound renal biopsy is contraindicated. This allowed us to diagnose and subsequently treat said patients.",

        "Published":"2020-07-12",
        "Abstract":"INTRODUCTION: Chronic kidney disease-mineral and bone disorder (CKD-MBD) leads to increased fracture risk. Iliac crest biopsy remains the gold standard for diagnosing bone disease in CKD. Unfortunately, bone biopsy is rarely performed which is mainly due to the inability of clinicians to perform the procedure. In this paper, we propose a fluoroscopy-guided procedure performed by interventional radiologists as a novel approach to iliac crest biopsy in adult population. We describe the implementation of the procedure and present the first 11 cases of CKD patients who underwent iliac crest biopsy with this new approach.\nMETHODS: A nephrologist already trained in performing iliac crest biopsy initiated the creation of a fluoroscopy-based iliac crest biopsy program. Two interventional radiologists underwent a short training. Patients' demographical, clinical and biochemical data were collected on the day of the biopsy. Complications within the first three months after the procedure were collected from electronical records.\nRESULTS: IR rapidly mastered the procedure. The use of fluoroscopy allowed a precise localisation of the biopsy site and standardization of the intervention, which ensured specimen quality. The new approach allowed CKD patients to access iliac crest biopsy, which resulted in precise bone disease diagnosis (levels of bone turnover and mineralization) and targeted therapy for each case. There were no complications during, nor within 3 months after the intervention.\nCONCLUSIONS: We believe this approach will increase the access to iliac crest biopsy for diagnosing bone disease in CKD population. Studies are now needed to evaluate whether CKD patients will benefit from anti-osteoporotic therapy based on the results of iliac crest biopsy.",

        "Abstract":"BACKGROUND: Although emerging evidence suggest acute kidney injury (AKI) progress to chronic kidney disease (CKD), long-term renal outcome of AKI still remains unclear. Acute tubular necrosis (ATN) is the most common cause of AKI due to ischemia, toxin or sepsis. Acute interstitial nephritis (AIN), caused by drugs or autoimmune diseases is also increasingly recognized as an important cause of AKI. Unlike glomerular diseases, AKI is usually diagnosed in the clinical context without kidney biopsies, and lack of histology might contribute to this uncertainty.\nMETHODS: Among 8,769 biopsy series, 253 adults who were histologically diagnosed with ATN and AIN from 1982 to 2018 at five university hospitals were included. Demographic and pathological features that are associated with the development of end stage renal disease (ESRD) were also examined.\nRESULTS: Rate of non-recovery of renal function at 6 month was significantly higher in the AIN (ATN vs AIN 49.3 vs 69.4%,  = 0.007) with a 2.71-fold higher risk of non- recovery compared to ATN (95% confidence interval [CI], 1.20-6.47). During the mean follow up of 76.5 ± 91.9 months, ESRD developed in 39.4% of patients with AIN, and 21.5% patients of ATN. The risk of ESRD was significantly higher in AIN (23.05; 95% CI, 2.42-219.53) and also in ATN (12.14; 95% CI, 1.19-24.24) compared to control with non-specific pathology. Older age, female gender, renal function at the time of biopsy and at 6 months, proteinuria and pathological features including interstitial inflammation and fibrosis, tubulitis, vascular lesion were significantly associated with progression to ESRD.\nCONCLUSION: Our study demonstrated that patients with biopsy proven ATN and AIN are at high risk of developing ESRD. AIN showed higher rate of non-renal recovery at 6 month than ATN.",

        "Abstract":"Chronic kidney diseases have become a major issue worldwide. The spectrum of biopsy proven renal diseases differs between locations and changes over time. It is therefore essential to describe the local epidemiological trends and the prevalence of renal biopsy in various regions to shine new light on the pathogenesis of various renal diseases and provide a basis for further hypothesis-driven research. We retrospectively analyzed 34,630 hospitalized patients undergoing native renal biopsy between January 1, 2009 and December 31, 2018. Indications for renal biopsy and histological diagnosis were analyzed to describe the prevalence of renal biopsy, and changing prevalence between period 1 (2009-2013) and period 2 (2014-2018) were further analyzed. Nephrotic syndrome (NS) was the most common indication for biopsy. Membranous nephropathy (MN, 24.96%) and IgA nephropathy (IgAN, 24.09%) were the most common primary glomerulonephritis (PGN). MN was most common in adults, with IgAN more prevalent in children. Lupus nephritis (LN) was the most common secondary glomerulonephritis (SGN) in adults, while Henöch-Schönlein purpura nephritis (HSPN) in children. The prevalence of MN increased significantly and nearly doubled from period 1 (15.98%) to period 2 (30.81%) (P = 0.0004). The same trend appeared with membranoproliferative glomerulonephritis (MPGN), diabetic nephropathy (DN) and obesity-related glomerulopathy (ORG), while the frequencies of minimal change disease (MCD), focal segmental glomerulosclerosis (FSGS), LN and hepatitis B associated glomerulonephritis (HBV-GN) significantly decreased between the two intervals. NS was the most common indication for biopsy across all age groups and genders. MN has overtaken IgAN to become the most common PGN in adults, while IgAN was the most common PGN in children. LN was the most common SGN in adults, and HSPN the most common in children.",

Decision tree analysis and ROC curve-based methods of optimal cut-offs were used to improve clinical nephrosclerosis criteria.\nRESULTS: Nephrosclerosis prevalence was 2.7% in the general population, and eGFR decline and risk for kidney-related hospital admissions and ESKD were comparable to patients with diabetic kidney disease. In the biopsy cohort, current clinical criteria had very low sensitivity (0.13) but high specificity (0.94) for biopsy-verified arterionephrosclerosis. A new optimized diagnostic algorithm based on proteinuria (<0.75 g d ), systolic blood pressure (>155 mm Hg) and age (>75 years) only marginally improved diagnostic accuracy (sensitivity 0.19, specificity 0.96). Likewise, there were still false-positive cases with treatable diagnoses like glomerulonephritis, interstitial nephritis and others (40% of all test positive). Decision curve analysis showed that the new criteria can lead to higher clinical utility, especially for patients considering the potential harms to be close to the potential benefits, while the more risk-tolerant ones (harm:benefit ratio < 1:4) should consider kidney biopsy.\nCONCLUSION: Further improvements of the current clinical criteria seem difficult, so risks and benefits of kidney biopsy could be more actively discussed with selected patients to reduce misclassification and direct treatment.",

The most common cause of APN is the use of oral sodium phosphate for bowel cleansing preparations. However, there are other less commonly known sources of phosphate that are equally important. To date, our literature search did not identify any report of excessive dietary phosphate as a cause of APN.\nCASE SUMMARY: We report an unusual case of a 39-year-old diabetic male who presented with epigastric pain and oliguria. Work-up showed elevated serum creatinine, potassium, and calcium-phosphate product, and metabolic acidosis. The patient was admitted in the intensive care unit and received emergent renal replacement therapy. Kidney biopsy revealed tubular cell injury with transparent crystal casts positive for Von Kossa staining, which established the diagnosis of APN.\nCONCLUSION: This case confirmed that APN may occur with other sources of phosphorus, highlighting the importance of good history taking and kidney biopsy in patients with predisposing factors for APN. Raising awareness on the possibility of APN and its timely recognition and management is imperative so that appropriate measures can be instituted to prevent or delay its progression to end stage renal disease.",

        "Abstract":"We studied the relative association of clinical, histologic, and molecular variables with risk of kidney transplant failure after an indication biopsy, both in all kidneys and in kidneys with pure antibody-mediated rejection (ABMR). From a prospective study of 1679 biopsies with histologic and molecular testing, we selected one random biopsy per patient (N = 1120), including 321 with pure molecular ABMR. Diagnoses were associated with actuarial survival differences but not good predictions. Therefore we concentrated on clinical (estimated GFR [eGFR], proteinuria, time posttransplant, donor-specific antibody [DSA]) and molecular and histologic features reflecting injury (acute kidney injury [AKI] and atrophy-fibrosis [chronic kidney disease (CKD)] and rejection. For all biopsies, univariate analysis found that failure was strongly associated with low eGFR, AKI, CKD, and glomerular deterioration, but not with rejection activity. In molecular ABMR, the findings were similar: Molecular and histologic activity and DSA were not important compared with injury. Survival in DSA-negative and DSA-positive molecular ABMR was similar. Multivariate survival analysis confirmed the dominance of molecular AKI, CKD, and eGFR. Thus, at indication biopsy, the dominant predictors of failure, both in all kidneys and in ABMR, were related to molecular AKI and CKD and to eGFR, not rejection activity, presumably because rejection confers risk via injury.",

        "Abstract":"BACKGROUND AND OBJECTIVES: Histomorphometric analysis of a transiliac bone biopsy is the gold standard for the diagnosis of renal osteodystrophy (ROD). This procedure is costly, invasive and usually performed with a trephine with an internal diameter of 7.5 mm. Our objective was to evaluate the accuracy of ROD diagnosis on halved histological bone sections to determine if they are comparable to the standard 7.5 mm samples.\nDESIGN: We included 68 bone biopsies performed in CKD patients for diagnostic purposes with a 7.5 mm diameter trephine. Quantitative histomorphometric analysis of the whole bone samples was performed including assessment of bone mineralization, turnover and volume. Each histological section (representing the whole 7.5 mm diameter biopsy) was then divided lengthwise in two hemisections (representing the 3.5 mm diameter biopsy). Histomorphometric analysis was repeated this time on the two hemibiopsies for each sample, blinded from initial results. Diagnoses were classified as osteitis fibrosa, adynamic bone disease, mixed uremic bone disease, osteomalacia or other. Correlations between the whole sample and the hemibiopsies for each parameter were studied. Concordance between the various bone parameters and final ROD diagnosis obtained from the whole section versus the two hemi sections was evaluated.\nRESULTS: Highly significant correlations were found between parameters measured on the whole section and the corresponding hemisections, with r coefficient of 0.98 for osteoid surface and thickness and bone formation rate, 0.97 for osteoclast surface, and 0.96 for bone volume (p < 0.001). Final diagnosis was in full accordance between the whole biopsy and the two corresponding hemi-biopsies in 91% of cases.\nCONCLUSIONS: Accurate diagnosis of ROD type was obtained by evaluation of bone surface areas of 3 mm diameter. These data suggest that small invasive bone biopsies might provide accurate ROD diagnostics while decreasing both invasiveness and cost of the procedure.",

Few studies have addressed the amyloid compartmental distribution and associated clinical outcomes. The aim of this study was to present a case series of renal amyloidosis correlating histopathological data with glomerular filtration rate (GFR) during kidney biopsy. We studied 53 cases reviewed by nephropathologists from 2000 to 2018 in a single kidney biopsy center in Brazil. GFR was estimated using the CKD-EPI formula. Cases were divided into Group A ≥60 and Group B <60 mL·min-1·(1.73 m2)-1 using the estimated GFR during kidney biopsy. Semiquantitative histopathological study was performed, including extension and distribution of amyloid deposits by compartments (glomeruli, tubulointerstitial tissue, and vessels). Statistical analyses were made to understand associations with lower GFR. No difference was seen for age, gender, proteinuria, hematuria, subtype of amyloid protein, arteriosclerosis, interstitial fibrosis\/infiltrate, or glomerular and interstitial amyloid deposits. After a previous P value <0.1 in the descriptive analysis, the following variables were selected: globally sclerotic glomeruli, high blood pressure, and the extension of vascular amyloid deposition. A binary logistic regression model with GFR as the dependent variable showed history of hypertension and vascular amyloid to be robust and independent predictors of Group B <60 mL·min-1·(1.73 m2)-1. Beyond the histopathologic diagnosis of amyloidosis, a semiquantitative approach on renal biopsy could provide new insights.

However, presence of endothelial swelling, subendothelial widening, and fragmented erythrocytes was found to be correlated with a favorable final outcome.\nCONCLUSIONS: Presence of vascular thrombosis, cortical necrosis, and glomerular sclerosis in histopathological evaluation correlated with developing CKD. Chronic changes in the interstitial compartment were also related to poor prognosis, a finding that has been shown for the first time in pediatric aHUS cases.",

As this entity has paramount importance, so we evaluated the frequency and etiological of TIN both acute TIN (ATIN) and chronic tububulo-interstitial nephritis (CTIN) in renal biopsies. This is a retrospective observational, descriptive study carried out in the Department of Nephrology at The Kidney Centre Post Graduate Training Institute from 2004 to 2016. A total of 1560 adult renal biopsies were done during this period with 125 biopsies of TIN, of which 70 (56%) cases were ATIN and 55 (44%), were CTIN. Thirty-eight (30%) patients had a history of taking proton-pump inhibitors, use of various antibiotics in 21 (16%) cases, and 11 (8%) patients had a history of taking Hakeemi (traditional healer using herbs and sometimes trace amounts of heavy metals) medications. The incidence of TIN is higher than suspected and can be caused by variety of etiological agents. Therefore, clinical awareness will help in the diagnosis and early identification of the disease.",

        "Abstract":"A 74-year-old man presented with nephrotic syndrome and kidney insufficiency. Laboratory tests revealed monoclonal gammopathy of immunoglobulin A-lambda. Renal biopsy revealed diffuse mesangial proliferation and double-contoured basement membranes. Immunofluorescent analyses showed granular deposition of immunoglobulin A and C3 at the capillary walls and mesangial regions. Immunohistochemistry suggested monoclonal deposition of immunoglobulin A1-lambda. Electron microscopic analyses showed finely granular electron-dense deposits at mesangial and subendothelial areas. These findings suggested immunoglobulin A-type proliferative glomerulonephritis with monoclonal immunoglobulin deposits. Based on the results of bone marrow aspiration, multiple myeloma was diagnosed. Because the renal manifestation was considered to be affected by monoclonal gammopathy, chemotherapy was initiated rather than immunomodulatory therapy. Although bortezomib and dexamethasone proved ineffective, second chemotherapy with elotuzumab, lenalidomide, and dexamethasone was successful, and kidney function recovered. Effective treatments for proliferative glomerulonephritis with monoclonal immunoglobulin deposits have not been established. This represents the first description of a patient successfully treated for proliferative glomerulonephritis with monoclonal immunoglobulin deposits by chemotherapy using elotuzumab.",

        "Abstract":"['2', '2']\nA significant relationship has been established between central hemodynamics and renal microvascular damage. We hypothesized that the increase in the ankle-brachial index (ABI) with age is due to increased arterial stiffness and wave reflection and is thus associated with the pathogenesis of the renal small artery in patients with chronic kidney disease (CKD). We recruited 122 patients with CKD (stages 1-5) who underwent renal biopsy and ABI measurements between 2010 and 2013. Renal small artery intimal thickening (SA-IT) severity was assessed by semiquantitative grading. The median age was 47 years, with a range of 15-86 years (47% women). The median estimated glomerular filtration rate (eGFR) was 62 mL\/min\/1.73 m. Compared with patients with the lowest 1-3 SA-IT index quartile, those with the highest quartile of the SA-IT index were older in age had higher mean arterial pressure, ABI, brachial-ankle pulse wave velocity, and lower eGFR. ABI was positively associated with SA-IT severity and inversely associated with eGFR. Multivariate logistic regression analyses showed that ABI was significantly associated with the highest quartile of the SA-IT index (odds ratio per SD increase in ABI, 1.83; 95% confidence interval, 1.08-3.26) and low eGFR (<60 mL\/min\/1.73 m) (odds ratio per SD increase in ABI, 1.74; 95% confidence interval, 1.03-3.03). In conclusion, a high normal ABI was associated with severe renal small artery intimal thickening and low eGFR in patients with CKD.",

Elucidating the mechanisms underlying proteinuria in DKD is crucial because it is a common problem in DKD-related mortality and morbidity. MicroRNAs (miRs) associated with DKD have been detected in experimental diabetes models and in patients with both diabetes and CKD. Here, we aimed to investigate pathologic miRs in diabetic nephropathy (DN) by prospectively following six nephrotic, biopsy-proven isolated DN patients (enrolled between August 2015 and July 2017) for one year. The urinary exosomes were isolated at the time of the biopsy and the contained miRs were analyzed by next-generation sequencing. The results were compared to the control group, composed of age-, gender-, and CKD stage-matched patients with proteinuric CKD who did not present diabetes. Among the 72 identified miRs, we investigated eight (miR-188-5p, miR-150-3p, miR-760, miR-3677-3p, miR-548ah-3p, miR-548p, miR-320e, and miR-23c) exhibiting the strongest upregulation (13-15 fold) and two (miR-133a-3p and miR-153-3p) with the strongest downregulation (7-9 fold). The functional analysis of these miRs showed that they were involved in known and novel pathways of DN, supporting their pathologic roles. The bioinformatics-based prediction of the target genes of these miRs will inspire future research on the mechanisms underlying DN pathogenesis.",

        "Abstract":"AIMS: Diabetic nephropathy, a pathologically diagnosed microvascular complication of diabetes, is a strong risk factor for cardiovascular events, which mainly involve arteries larger than those affected in diabetic nephropathy. However, the association between diabetic nephropathy pathological findings and cardiovascular events has not been well studied. We aimed to investigate whether the pathological findings in diabetic nephropathy are closely associated with cardiovascular event development.\nMETHODS: This retrospective cohort study analysed 377 people with type 2 diabetes and biopsy-proven diabetic nephropathy, with a median follow-up of 5.9 years (interquartile range 2.0 to 13.5). We investigated how cardiovascular events were impacted by two vascular diabetic nephropathy lesions, namely arteriolar hyalinosis and arterial intimal thickening, and by glomerular and interstitial lesions.\nRESULTS: Of the 377 people with diabetic nephropathy, 331 (88%) and 295 (78%) had arteriolar hyalinosis and arterial intimal thickening, respectively. During the entire follow-up period, those with arteriolar hyalinosis had higher cardiovascular event rates in the crude Kaplan-Meier analysis than those without these lesions (P = 0.005, log-rank test). When fully adjusted for clinically relevant confounders, arteriolar hyalinosis independently predicted cardiovascular events [hazard ratio (HR) 1.99; 95% confidence interval (CI) 1.12, 3.86], but we did not find any relationship between arterial intimal thickening and cardiovascular events (HR 0.89; 95% CI 0.60, 1.37). Additionally, neither glomerular nor interstitial lesions were independently associated with cardiovascular events in the fully adjusted model.\nCONCLUSIONS: Arteriolar hyalinosis, but not intimal thickening of large arteries, was strongly associated with cardiovascular events in people with diabetic nephropathy.",

However, studies investigating the relationship between the amount of proteinuria during follow-up and long-term renal prognosis in BNS are limited. This study aimed to assess the relationship between time-averaged proteinuria (TAP) and renal prognosis in BNS.\nMETHODS: The study participants included 98 patients with biopsy-proven BNS (average age 52 ± 13 years, estimated glomerular filtration rate (eGFR) 53 ± 25 ml\/min\/1.73 m, urine protein excretion at baseline 1.34 ± 1.30 g\/gCr) from the Jikei University Hospital. Multivariate analysis was used to investigate the effects of TAP and other clinicopathological findings on the risk for renal outcome in biopsy-proven BNS (a 30% decline in eGFR from baseline or end-stage renal disease). Proteinuria was measured every 6 months and the mean value was used as an indicator of TAP.\nRESULTS: The average observation period was 56 ± 43 months. In the unadjusted model, higher levels of TAP and urinary protein at baseline, glomerulosclerosis, and tubulointerstitial damage were associated with renal prognosis. The adjusted model demonstrated a significant association between TAP and renal outcomes (hazard ratio 5.45, 95% confidence interval 3.02-10.7), which was independent of higher baseline proteinuria, glomerulosclerosis, and tubulointerstitial damage.\nCONCLUSIONS: TAP is an independent risk factor for renal prognosis in patients with BNS, indicating the significance of urinary protein excretion during follow-up for the progression of BNS.

Patients were grouped into 2 categories as amyloid nephropathy (AN, n = 16) and non-amyloid nephropathy (N-AN, n = 14).\nRESULTS: The mean age at FMF diagnosis was 7.2 ± 3.0 years. The AN group showed higher rates of hypertension, higher levels of 24-h protein excretion and serum creatinine, and lower estimated glomerular filtration rate at the time of kidney biopsy. The rate of ESRD was found to be higher in the AN group (p = 0.011). Mesangioproliferative glomerulonephritis was the most common pathology in the N-AN group (21.4%).

More information on the phenotype and prognosis is needed to improve clinical diagnostics and treatment.\nMETHODS: We included all Norwegian patients with chronic kidney disease (CKD) referred for kidney biopsy between 1988 and 2012 whose clinical presentation was consistent with, but not primarily suspicious for, hypertensive nephrosclerosis (n = 4920); follow-up continued until 2013.\nRESULTS: A total of 918 patients (19%) had biopsy-verified hypertensive nephrosclerosis (i.e., arterionephrosclerosis). Their most common biopsy indications were proteinuria (57%), low estimated glomerular filtration rate (eGFR) (44%), hematuria (34%), or combinations of these indications. Multivariable logistic regression analysis revealed that arterionephrosclerosis was significantly associated with higher age, male sex, not having diabetes, higher blood pressure, lower proteinuria, and not having hematuria ( < 0.01 for all). Body mass index, cholesterol, high-density lipoprotein cholesterol, and eGFR were not significantly associated with arterionephrosclerosis ( > 0.05 for all). The most common biopsy-verified diagnoses in patients fulfilling the clinical criteria for hypertensive nephrosclerosis were arterionephrosclerosis (40%), glomerulonephritis (22%), and interstitial nephritis (14%), reflecting that the criteria had low sensitivity (0.17) and high specificity (0.94). ESRD and mortality risks did not differ in patients with arterionephrosclerosis compared to patients with glomerulonephritis, interstitial nephritis, or other relevant diagnoses ( > 0.1 for both), whereas patients with diabetic kidney disease had a 2-fold higher risk ( < 0.001 for both).\nCONCLUSION: Arterionephrosclerosis is a high-risk disease, often with an atypical phenotype with proteinuria and hematuria contributing to low accuracy for current clinical criteria for hypertensive nephrosclerosis.",

        "Abstract":"BACKGROUND: Interstitial fibrosis (IF) on kidney biopsy is one of the most potent risk factors for kidney disease progression. The furosemide stress test (FST) is a validated tool that predicts the severity of acute kidney injury (especially at 2 h) in critically ill patients. Since furosemide is secreted through the kidney tubules, the response to FST represents the tubular secretory capacity. To our knowledge there is no data on the correlation between functional tubular capacity assessed by the FST with IF on kidney biopsies from patients with chronic kidney disease (CKD). The aim of this study was to determine the association between urine output (UO), Furosemide Excreted Mass (FEM) and IF on kidney biopsies after a FST.\nMETHODS: This study included 84 patients who underwent kidney biopsy for clinical indications and a FST. The percentage of fibrosis was determined by morphometry technique and reviewed by a nephropathologist. All patients underwent a FST prior to the biopsy. Urine volume and urinary sodium were measured in addition to urine concentrations of furosemide at different times (2, 4 and 6 h). We used an established equation to determine the FEM. Values were expressed as mean, standard deviation or percentage and Pearson Correlation.\nRESULTS: The mean age of the participants was 38 years and 44% were male. The prevalence of diabetes mellitus, hypertension and diuretic use was significantly higher with more advanced degree of fibrosis. Nephrotic syndrome and acute kidney graft dysfunction were the most frequent indications for biopsy. eGFR was inversely related to the degree of fibrosis. Subjects with the highest degree of fibrosis (grade 3) showed a significant lower UO at first hour of the FST when compared to lower degrees of fibrosis (p = 0.015). Likewise, the total UO and the FEM was progressively lower with higher degrees of fibrosis. An inversely linear correlation between FEM and the degree of fibrosis (r = - 0.245, p = 0.02) was observed.\nCONCLUSIONS: Our findings indicate that interstitial fibrosis correlates with total urine output and FEM. Further studies are needed to determine if UO and FST could be a non-invasive tool to evaluate interstitial fibrosis.\nTRIAL REGISTRATION: ClinicalTrials.gov NCT02417883.",

We conducted a retrospective study with 968 patients with T2DM who underwentrenal biopsy for the pathological confirmation of DNat the First Affiliated Hospital of Zhengzhou University from February 2012 to January 2015; the patients were followed until December 2018. The outcome was defined as a fatal or nonfatal ESRD event (peritoneal dialysis or hemodialysis for ESRD, renal transplantation, or death due to chronic renal failure or ESRD). The dataset was randomly split into development (75%) and validation (25%) cohorts. We used stepwise multivariablelogistic regression to identify baseline predictors for model development. The model's performance in the two cohorts, including discrimination and calibration, was evaluated by the C-statistic and the  value of the Hosmer-Lemeshow test. During the 3-year follow-up period, there were 225 outcome events (47.1%) during follow-up. Outcomes occurred in 187 patients (52.2%) in the derivation cohort and 38 patients (31.7%) in the validation cohort. The variables selected in the final multivariable logistic regression after backward selection were pathological grade, Log Urinary Albumin-to-creatinine ratio (Log ACR), cystatin C, estimated glomerular filtration rate (eGFR) and B-type natriuretic peptide (BNP). 4 prediction models were created in a derivation cohort of 478 patients: a clinical model that included cystatin C, eGFR, BNP, Log ACR; a clinical-pathological model and a clinical-medication model, respectively, also contained pathological grade and renin-angiotensin system blocker (RASB) use; and a full model that also contained the pathological grade, RASB use and age. Compared with the clinical model, the clinical-pathological model and the full model had better C statistics (0.865 and 0.866, respectively, vs. 0.864) in the derivation cohort and better C statistics (0.876 and 0.875, respectively, vs. 0.870) in the validation cohort. Among the four models, the clinical-pathological model had the lowest AIC of 332.53 and the best  value of 0.909 of the Hosmer-Lemeshow test.

        "Abstract":"BACKGROUND: Goodpasture syndrome (GS) is a rare disease, the morbidity of which is estimated to be 0.5-0.8 per million per year. Hemorrhage is the most serious complication in renal biopsy. Despite the fact that both GS and hemorrhage after renal biopsy are rare, it has not been reported that they are likely to occur in the same patient.\nCASE SUMMARY: A 30-year-old man with diffuse pulmonary hemorrhage and rapid progressive renal function caused by anti-glomerular basement membrane disease presented atypical symptoms without hemoptysis, accompanied by life-threatening hypoxemia. Plasmapheresis was performed, and glucocorticoids and cyclophosphamide were administered. The patient started to show signs of improvement. Percutaneous renal biopsy is an appropriate diagnostic measure that is commonly safe, but this patient experienced hemorrhage after operation, thus necessitating embolization of the renal artery to stop the bleeding. The patient's condition was improved, and the serum anti-glomerular basement membrane antibody level was 106 AU\/mL (normal range: < 24 AU\/mL) and slowly decreased. His discharge medications were oral daily prednisone (30 mg) and continued maintenance hemodialysis.\nCONCLUSION: GS is a rare organ-specific autoimmune disease that is invariably ubiquitous in the lung and kidney areas. Renal biopsy is the appropriate procedure for the treatment of GS disease, although it is an invasive measure.",

They conducted a face validation study with five experts who were either adult\/pediatric nephrologists or interventional\/diagnostic radiologists. The trainer was rated very highly (>4.4) for the usefulness of the real US images (highest at 4.8), potential usefulness of the trainer in training for needle visualization, tracking, steadiness and hand-eye coordination, and overall promise of the trainer to be useful for training US-guided needle biopsies. The lowest score of 2.4 was received for the look and feel of the US probe and needle compared to clinical practice. The force feedback received a moderate score of 3.0. The clinical experts provided abundant verbal and written subjective feedback and were highly enthusiastic about using the trainer as a valuable tool for future trainees.",

Nephropathology services are usually available at larger pathology units only because of the special equipment needed for light microscopy, immunohistology, and electron microscopy, the low number of biopsies processed compared to other fields, and the special expertise needed to read and sign out the cases. Biopsy diagnosis crucially contributes to the diagnostic workup and therapy of patients with kidney diseases. Increasingly, new immunohistochemical markers allow an etiological classification. We discuss paraprotein-associated kidney diseases in more detail because they are relatively common. Many of these patients do not fulfil the diagnostic criteria of plasma cell myeloma. Several years ago, the term «monoclonal gammopathy of renal significance» (MGRS) and a more aggressive therapeutic approach was introduced for these patients, with an improvement in mortality and morbidity. We also review the new group of complement C3-glomerulopathies. Although relatively rare, they have a very interesting pathophysiology and novel anti-complement therapies may provide new therapeutic approaches.",

        "Published":"2020-01-06",
        "Abstract":"BACKGROUND: The use of procurement biopsies for assessing kidney quality has been implicated as a driver of the nearly 20% kidney discard rate in the United States. Yet in some contexts, biopsies may boost clinical confidence, enabling acceptance of kidneys that would otherwise be discarded. We leveraged a novel organ offer simulation platform to conduct a controlled experiment isolating biopsy effects on offer acceptance decisions.\nMETHODS: Between November 26 and December 14, 2018, 41 kidney transplant surgeons and 27 transplant nephrologists each received the same 20 hypothetical kidney offers using a crossover design with weekend \"washout\" periods. Mini-study 1 included four, low serum creatinine (<1.5 mg\/dl) donor offers with arguably \"poor\" biopsy findings that were based on real offers that were accepted with successful 3-year recipient outcome. For each of the four offers, two experimental variants-no biopsy and \"good\" biopsy-were also sent. Mini-study 2 included four AKI offers with no biopsy, each having an offer variant with \"good\" biopsy findings.\nRESULTS: Among low serum creatinine donor offers, we found approximately threefold higher odds of acceptance when arguably poor biopsy findings were hidden or replaced with good biopsy findings. Among AKI donor offers, we found nearly fourfold higher odds of acceptance with good biopsy findings compared with no biopsy. Biopsy information had profound but variable effects on decision making: more participants appeared to have been influenced by biopsies to rule out, versus rule in, transplantable kidneys.\nCONCLUSIONS: The current use of biopsies in the United States appears skewed toward inducing kidney discard. Several areas for improvement, including reducing variation in offer acceptance decisions and more accurate interpretation of findings, have the potential to make better use of scarce, donated organs. Offer simulation studies are a viable research tool for understanding decision making and identifying ways to improve the transplant system.",

        "Published":"2019-08-14",
        "Abstract":"INTRODUCTION: Soluble fms-like tyrosine kinase 1 (sFLT1) is a splice variant of the vascular endothelial growth factor (VEGF) receptor lacking the transmembrane and cytoplasmic domains and acts as a powerful antagonist of VEGF signaling. Plasma sFLT1 levels are higher in patients with chronic kidney disease (CKD) and correlate with renal dysfunction. The source of plasma sFLT1 in CKD is unclear.\nMETHODS: Fifty-two renal biopsies were studied for sFLT1 expression using immunohistochemistry and evaluated on a 0-4 grading scale of positive cells within inflammatory infiltrates. These included drug-induced interstitial nephritis (6); allografts (12), with polyomavirus nephritis (3); diabetes mellitus (10); lupus glomerulonephritis (6); pauci-immune vasculitis (7); IgA nephropathy (6); and miscellaneous CKD (5).\nRESULTS: Forty-seven biopsies had inflammatory infiltrates of which 37 had sFLT1-positive cells: of these biopsies, 3 were grade 4, i.e., had cells that constituted more than 50% of the inflammatory infiltrate, 9 were grade 3 (25%-50%), 5 were grade 2 (10%-25%), 3 were grade 1 (10%), and 17 were grade 0.5 (<10%). There was a robust correlation (r = 0.89) between degree of inflammation and sFLT1-positive cells. CD68\/sFLT1 co-immunostaining studies indicated that sFLT1-positive cells were histiocytes. The surrounding capillary network was reduced.\nCONCLUSION: sFLT1-positive histiocytes are generally part of the inflammatory infiltrates noted in CKD and are particularly abundant in forms of interstitial nephritis. Their presence promotes an anti-angiogenic state locally in the tubulointerstitium that could inhibit capillary repair, contribute to peritubular capillary loss, and enhance fibrosis in CKD.",

        "Abstract":"BACKGROUND: Renal biopsy is the mainstay of renal pathological diagnosis. Despite sophisticated diagnostic techniques, it is not always possible to make a precise pathological diagnosis. Our aim was to identify a genetic cause of disease in patients who had undergone renal biopsy and determine if genetic testing altered diagnosis or treatment.\nMETHODS: Patients with suspected familial kidney disease underwent a variety of next-generation sequencing (NGS) strategies. The subset of these patients who had also undergone native kidney biopsy was identified. Histological specimens were reviewed by a consultant pathologist, and genetic and pathological diagnoses were compared.\nRESULTS: Seventy-five patients in 47 families underwent genetic sequencing and renal biopsy. Patients were grouped into 5 diagnostic categories based on pathological diagnosis: tubulointerstitial kidney disease (TIKD; n = 18); glomerulonephritis (GN; n = 15); focal segmental glomerulosclerosis and Alport Syndrome (n = 11); thrombotic microangiopathy (TMA; n = 17); and nonspecific pathological changes (n = 14). Thirty-nine patients (52%) in 21 families (45%) received a genetic diagnosis; 13 cases (72%) with TIKD, 4 (27%) with GN, 6 (55%) with focal segmental glomerulosclerosis\/Alport syndrome, and 10 (59%) with TMA and 6 cases (43%) with nonspecific features. Genetic testing resulted in changes in understanding of disease mechanism in 21 individuals (54%) in 12 families (57%). Treatment would have been altered in at least 26% of cases (10\/39).\nCONCLUSIONS: An accurate genetic diagnosis can result in changes in clinical diagnosis, understanding of pathological mechanism, and treatment. NGS should be considered as a complementary diagnostic technique to kidney biopsy in the evaluation of patients with kidney disease.",

However, there is a lack of current data on trends of renal disease in Central Europe.\nMETHODS: After exclusion of transplant and re-biopsies, the renal biopsy registry of the German RWTH Aachen University Hospital included data of 1208 biopsies over a period of 24 years (1990-2013). Trends in the biopsy rate and diagnosis of glomerular diseases were analysed.\nRESULTS: The average annual biopsy incidence was 6.1 biopsies per 100 000 population. The frequency of kidney biopsies increased significantly over the years (P < 0.001). Primary glomerulonephritis (GN) accounted for nearly two-thirds (58.4%) of all native kidney biopsies, and immunoglobulin A-nephropathy (IgAN) was the leading histological diagnosis (34.7%) followed by necrotizing GN (RPGN) at 18.7%. IgAN increased 2-fold over the study periods (+195%, P < 0.001). Focal segmental glomerulosclerosis accounted for 6.1% of all diagnoses, and its frequency rose to 3.9-fold (+388%, P < 0.001). Lupus nephritis showed a doubling in incidence (P = 0.0499), while acute tubular necrosis decreased to 3.5-fold (P = 0.0008). All other disease entities failed to exhibit linear trends over time. In children, the most common pathologies were IgAN (26.1%) and minimal change disease (21.7%), whereas RPGN (19.4%) dominated in the group of patients >60 years.\nCONCLUSION: IgAN was the most common primary glomerular disease in our centre and its prevalence increased over 24 years.",

        "Abstract":"OBJECTIVE: The predictive value of diabetic retinopathy on end-stage kidney disease (ESKD) has not been fully addressed in patients with type 2 diabetes and diabetic kidney disease.\nRESEARCH DESIGN AND METHODS: We studied 232 patients with type 2 diabetes and biopsy-proven diabetic kidney disease who were screened for diabetic retinopathy during the 1 month of kidney biopsy. We examined the association between retinopathy progression and renal lesions. We used Cox regression analyses to explore the risk of ESKD adjusting for known risk demographic and clinical variables. We assessed the incremental prognostic value of ESKD by adding diabetic retinopathy to the clinical variables.\nRESULTS: The diabetic retinopathy progression positively correlated with all scores of renal lesions, especially with the glomerular-based classification (r=0.41), scores of interstitial fibrosis (r=0.41) and diffuse lesion (r=0.48). During a median follow-up of 5.7 years, 114 patients developed ESKD. Adjusting for known risk factors of ESKD, the HR for ESKD (patients with no apparent retinopathy as a reference) were 1.96 (95% CI 0.62 to 6.17) for patients with mild non-proliferative diabetic retinopathy (NPDR), 3.10 (95% CI 1.45 to 6.65) for patients with moderate NPDR, 3.03 (95% CI 1.44 to 6.37) for patients with severe NPDR, and 3.43 (95% CI 1.68 to 7.03) for patients with proliferative diabetic retinopathy, respectively. Addition of the retinopathy grading to the clinical model alone improved the prognostic value (the global χ statistic increased from 155.2 to 164.5; p<0.001), which is an improvement equivalent to the addition of the renal lesion grading to the clinical model.\nCONCLUSIONS: Retinopathy progression appeared to be associated with renal lesions and the development of ESKD. Our findings suggest that diabetic retinopathy and kidney disease share the same magnitude of disease progression, and therefore diabetic retinopathy may be useful for prognosticating the clinical course for diabetic kidney disease.",

The 4-year graft cumulative survival rate after biopsy diagnosis of IgAN in renal allografts was 59.6%. The mean time ± SD to disease was 4.7 ± 3.5 years. The color doppler ultrasound and blood flow imagine showed the echo enhancement, the reduced blood flow distribution, the reduced peak systolic velocity of main renal artery, and the increased resistance index of arcuate renal artery were valuable in evaluating the graft dysfunction. The Cox multivariate analysis revealed that the 24-h urinary protein level (HR 1.6 for 1-g increase, 95%CI 1.2-2.0), estimated glomerular filtration rate (eGFR) (HR 1.0 for 1-mL\/min\/1.73 m^2 decline, 95%CI 1.0-1.1), and mesangial C1q deposition (HR 3.0, 95%CI 1.2-7.4) at biopsy were independent predictive factors of graft failure of IgAN in renal allografts.\nCONCLUSIONS: IgAN in renal allografts occurred frequently within 5 years after transplantation. The risk of graft failure should be taken seriously in patients who exhibit heavy proteinuria and\/or a declined eGFR as the initial symptoms; a high lesion grade (grade IV-V of Lee's classification) and\/or mesangial C1q deposition may also indicated a poor outcome.",

Since end stage renal disease patients are those mainly affected, the term calcific uremic arteriolopathy (CUA) is also suggested. Early clinical manifestations are subtle, while overt necrotic ulcers may quickly spread and become infected so as to result in ominous outcome. Diagnosis might not be easy due to the number of other ischemic and non-ischemic skin lesions observed in uraemia. Skin biopsy, has been proposed as the diagnostic test and is often considered, but not systematically performed due to the hypothetical risk of further spreading of the lesions. Such ambiguity could be responsible for misdiagnosis or underdiagnosis. We review here five consecutive cases recorded in our Unit, all submitted to skin biopsy but with inconsistent results which generated some clinical frustration. Thus, we decided to carefully re-evaluate all of them together with pathologists and dermatologists. However, even after this ex-post discussion, we could not reach a complete agreement on the final diagnosis. In the meanwhile, papers were published in the literature that started to shed some light on the role of skin biopsy in the diagnosis of CUA.",

The present study was undertaken to evaluate efficacy of desmopressin in reducing bleeding after percutaneous kidney biopsy.\nMETHODS: Retrospective cohort study. 269 of 322 patients undergoing percutaneous kidney biopsy between January 1, 2014 and January 31, 2018 were included. Patients had normal bleeding time, platelet count and coagulation profile. Primary outcome was defined as composite of hemoglobin drop ≥1 g\/dL, hematoma on post biopsy ultrasound, gross hematuria, erythrocyte transfusion or angiography to stop bleeding. Association of desmopressin with outcomes was assessed using linear (for continuous variables) and logistic (for binary variables) regression models. Propensity score was used to minimize potential confounding.\nRESULTS: Desmopressin was administered to 100\/269 (37.17%) patients. After propensity score adjustment patients who received desmopressin had increased odds of post biopsy bleeding [OR 3.88 (1.95-7.74), p < 0.001]. Creatinine at time of biopsy influenced bleeding risk; gender, emergent vs elective biopsy, obesity, AKI, diabetes, hypertension or bleeding time did not influence bleeding risk. Administration of desmopressin to patients with serum creatinine ≥1.8 mg\/dL decreased bleeding risk [OR 2.11 (95% CI 0.87-5.11), p = 0.09] but increased bleeding risk when serum creatinine was < 1.8 mg\/dL (OR 9.72 (95% CI 2.95-31.96), p < 0.001).\nCONCLUSION: Desmopressin should not be used routinely prior to percutaneous kidney biopsy in patients at low risk for bleeding but should be reserved for patients who are at high risk for bleeding.",

        "Abstract":"Peliosis hepatis (PH) is a rare disease characterized by the presence of sinusoidal dilation and blood-filled cysts throughout the hepatic parenchyma. We report a case of PH in a 49-year-old woman with chronic renal failure (CRF) on hemodialysis and with renal cell carcinoma (RCC). Dynamic contrast-enhanced computed tomography (CT) showed a 35-mm-diameter, hypervascular tumor in the liver and RCC in the right renal cyst. Ultrasound and superparamagnetic iron oxide-enhanced magnetic resonance imaging were also performed; however, the liver tumor could not be distinguished from the metastasis of RCC. Therefore, echo-guided biopsy of the liver tumor using an 18-G Majima needle was performed. Histological evaluation of the specimen showed irregular sinusoidal dilatation and blood-filled cavities without malignant cells. She was ultimately diagnosed with PH. Subsequently, she underwent total right nephrectomy for RCC and was diagnosed with RCC stage 1 (pT1N0M0). A follow-up CT performed 4 months after nephrectomy showed no growth of PH. Although the development of PH in patients with CRF or RCC who do not undergo renal transplantation is extremely rare, it should be considered in the differential diagnosis to distinguish PH from the metastasis of RCC.",

We studied 35,183 and 14,266 discharge records with native and transplant KBx. We found that 5.7% (95% confidence interval [CI]: 5.3%-6.0%) of inpatients undergoing native KBx and 4.9% (4.2%-5.5%) of those undergoing transplant KBx received a pRBC transfusion within 2 days of biopsy. Similarly, 0.6% (0.5%-0.7%) of inpatients undergoing native KBx and 0.4% (0.2%-0.5%) undergoing transplant KBx received a renal angiogram within 2 days of KBx. For inpatient native KBx, female sex, older age, higher chronic kidney disease stage, acute renal failure, lupus, vasculitis, cirrhosis, multiple myeloma\/paraproteinemia, and anemia of chronic disease were independently associated with increased odds of pRBC transfusion; cirrhosis and end-stage renal disease (ESRD) were associated with increased odds, and nephrotic syndrome was associated with decreased odds, of renal angiography.\nCONCLUSIONS: In this large population-based study of inpatient KBx practices, we demonstrate increasing rates of inpatient native KBx among US adults and provide accurate estimates of the frequencies of, and risk factors for, pRBC transfusion and renal angiography following inpatient KBx.",

        "Abstract":"The optimal duration of maintenance immunosuppressive therapy for patients with lupus nephritis who have achieved clinical remission has not been established. Furthermore, clinical and histologic remissions are often discordant. We postulated that continuing therapy for patients with persistent histologic activity on kidney biopsies done during maintenance and discontinuing therapy only for patients without histologic activity would minimize subsequent lupus nephritis flares. To test this, a cohort of 75 prospectively-followed patients with proliferative lupus nephritis was managed using kidney biopsies performed during maintenance therapy. These patients had been on immunosuppression for at least 42 months, had responded, and had maintained their clinical response for at least 12 months before the kidney biopsy was repeated. Maintenance therapy was withdrawn if the biopsy showed an activity index of zero, but was continued if the biopsy showed an activity index of one or more. A lupus nephritis flare developed in seven patients during the average 50 months from the third biopsy and the final clinic visit for a flare rate of 1.5\/year; significantly less than reported flare rates. Baseline clinical parameters (serum creatinine, proteinuria) and serologic parameters (complement C3, C4 and anti-dsDNA) did not predict an activity index of zero on the third biopsy or who would have a lupus nephritis flare. No patients developed end-stage kidney disease. Four patients developed de novo chronic kidney disease. There were no serious adverse events related to biopsy. Thus, at an experienced center, biopsy-informed management of maintenance immunosuppression is safe and may improve the lupus nephritis flare rate compared to conventional clinical management.",

        "Abstract":"BACKGROUND: The performance of various equations for estimated glomerular filtration rate (eGFR) in patients with diabetes remains controversial. We aimed to evaluate the performance of equations for eGFR in Chinese patients with diabetic nephropathy (DN).\nMETHODS: This is a retrospective study included in 308 patients with type 2 diabetes and biopsy-proven DN who were followed up at least one year. eGFR was calculated using chronic kidney disease epidemiology (CKD-EPI) equations based on serum creatinine (eGFR), cystatin C (eGFR), and joint equations (eGFR), respectively. End-stage kidney disease was defined by initiation of renal replacement therapy. The eGFR concordance between equations was assessed by Bland-Altman plots. Log-rank and multivariable logistic regression were employed to evaluate the performance of equations.\nRESULTS: Overall, the proportion of patients with eGFR < 60 mL\/min\/1.73m was 53%, 70%, and 61% by the equations of eGFR, eGFR, and eGFR, respectively. Higher disconcordance was observed between equations when eGFR > 60 mL\/min\/1.73m. Compared with eGFR, 39% of patients were reclassified (reclassified group) from CKD 1-2 stages to CKD 3-5 stages by eGFR and they presented significantly longer diabetic duration, heavier proteinuria, advanced pathological lesions, and poorer kidney outcomes. Multivariable logistic regression indicated cystatin C was independently associated with advanced glomerular classifications.\nCONCLUSION: eGFR equations incorporating cystatin C are superior to eGFR based on creatinine alone for detecting kidney injury in the early stage. The independent association between cystatin C and glomerular classifications might contribute to it.",

        "Abstract":"['Background:', 'Methods:', 'Results:', 'Conclusions:']\nThe diagnostic utility of repeat kidney biopsy in AL amyloidosis patients in complete (CR) or very good partial hematologic response (VGPR) but with renal organ relapse is not clear. We present eight patients with AL amyloidosis who had a repeat kidney biopsy performed. AL amyloidosis was initially diagnosed by a kidney biopsy. All patients had a favorable response to treatment (CR\/VGPR) and five of them also had initially a renal organ response. A repeat kidney biopsy was done due to gradual deterioration of kidney function and\/or proteinuria while maintaining a hematologic response. Repeat kidney biopsies showed findings consistent with amyloid deposits in all patients. Seven patients had renal progression with four of them requiring dialysis initiation. Only one patient had a favorable renal outcome. This patient had subacute kidney injury with decreasing proteinuria and was found to have granulomatous interstitial nephritis in addition to amyloid deposits and responded well to steroid treatment with rapid improvement in renal function. In AL amyloidosis patients who achieve a favorable hematologic response to treatment (CR\/VGPR) but subsequently develop worsening renal insufficiency or proteinuria, a repeat kidney biopsy should generally not be performed. Amyloid deposits persist in the kidneys even after successful hematologic treatment and it is impossible to differentiate between new versus old amyloid deposits, which makes performing a repeat kidney biopsy unnecessary in most cases. Demonstration of amyloid deposits on repeat kidney biopsy would not aid in the decision making regarding re-initiation of hematologic treatment. A kidney biopsy should be considered only in cases when a specific alternative diagnosis is suspected.",

The aim of this study was to evaluate the prevalence of IBD among patients who have undergone renal biopsies due to clinical indications and to elucidate whether the presence of IBD influences renal and patient outcomes.\nMETHODS: We collected retrospective data on concomitant diseases, especially IBD, from adult patients undergoing renal biopsy for any clinical indication between 2000 and 2012 at Tampere University Hospital, Tampere, Finland. Information was systematically collected on the activity of IBD, medication for IBD, surgery performed for IBD and markers of kidney function.\nRESULTS: Of the 819 patients biopsied, 35 (4.3%) had IBD. The prevalence of IBD was 13.3 and 4.6% in patients with tubulointerstitial nephritis (TIN) and immunoglobulin A nephropathy (IgAN), respectively. In comparison, the prevalence of IBD in the Finnish population is 0.6%. Ulcerative colitis and Crohn's disease were equally represented. The presence of IBD showed no impact on renal and patient outcomes.\nCONCLUSIONS: IBD should not be overlooked in patients undergoing renal biopsies, especially those diagnosed with TIN or IgAN. The renal findings did not associate with the activity of intestinal inflammation.

        "Abstract":"BACKGROUND: As the incidence and prevalence rates of end stage renal disease (ESRD) rise globally, a disproportionate increase has been observed in the elderly population. Singapore has the fifth highest incidence of treated ESRD worldwide, with the upward trend of ESRD being most apparent among those aged 70 years and older. Although it is well-documented that ESRD patients suffer an impaired quality of life compared to the general population, there is limited research focusing on the unique experiences and needs of elderly ESRD patients in Asian populations. To address the knowledge gap, this study seeks to explore the impact of ESRD and dialysis on the quality of life of elderly (≥70 years old) ESRD patients in Singapore and examine the coping strategies utilised by these patients.\nMETHODS: This qualitative study involved semi-structured, in-depth interviews with 7 peritoneal dialysis patients, 5 haemodialysis patients, 4 patients on non-dialysis supportive care and 7 caregivers in Singapore. Interviews were conducted in English, Chinese, and Malay and fully transcribed. QSR NVivo 11 software was used for analysis.\nRESULTS: Participants reported that ESRD and dialysis had an impact on three highly interconnected areas of their quality of life: (a) biological\/physical (general symptoms, neuromuscular problems, skin problems and poor sleep quality); (b) psychological (depressive symptoms, anxiety and fears, stress and negative self-perceptions); and (c) social (increased dependence on family and loss of social life). There were four key strategies that participants used to cope with these biopsychosocial challenges: (a) family support (financial, practical and emotional support); (b) religious\/spiritual support (experiencing gratitude\/contentment, the power of prayer and belonging to a faith community); (c) avoidance (cognitive avoidance and distraction techniques); and (d) acceptance (positive thinking and problem solving).\nCONCLUSIONS: This study has provided insights into the biopsychosocial impact of ESRD and dialysis, as well as cultural and religious factors that shape the experiences and coping mechanisms of elderly ESRD patients and caregivers in Singapore, which can be used to further the development and implementation of more holistic and person-centred services to help each patient achieve a better quality of life.",

These conditions predispose patients to chronic kidney disease, as well as acute kidney injury (AKI). Notably, most epidemiological studies describing AKI have not investigated this patient population.\nMETHODS: Included patients admitted to the nephrology ward of a tertiary hospital who underwent percutaneous kidney biopsy. AKI was diagnosed based on the Kidney Disease: Improving Global Outcomes criteria.\nRESULTS: Of the 223 patients investigated, 140 (62.8%) showed AKI. Of these, 91 (65%), 19 (13.6%), and 30 (21.4%) presented with AKI classified as stages 1, 2, and 3, respectively. The primary indication for performing biopsy was nephrotic syndrome or nephrotic proteinuria (73 [52.1%] in the AKI vs. 51 [61.4%] in the non-AKI group, p = 0.048). Focal segmental glomerulosclerosis was the most prevalent primary disease (24 [17.1%] in the AKI vs. 15 [18.0%] in the non-AKI group, p = 0.150). Multivariate analysis of risk factors associated with AKI showed hemoglobin levels (odds ratio [OR] 0.805, 95% confidence interval [CI] 0.681-0.951, p = 0.011), serum high-density lipoprotein cholesterol levels (HDL-c, OR 0.970, 95% CI 0.949-0.992, p = 0.008), and baseline serum creatinine levels (OR 2.703, 95% CI 1.471-4.968, p = 0.001) were significantly associated with AKI.\nCONCLUSIONS: We observed a high prevalence of AKI in hospitalized patients who underwent kidney biopsy to investigate their renal disease, particularly glomerulonephritis.

Although no established cutoff criteria to diagnose oxalate nephropathy versus incidental CaOx deposition in the kidney exist, these conditions require different treatment. We noticed a significant decrease in the number of CaOx deposits in the kidney biopsy cores that were fixed in Michel transport medium (MTM) as compared to their counterparts fixed in formalin.\nOBJECTIVE.—: To investigate the impact of different fixatives on the number of CaOx deposits in kidney biopsy specimens.\nDESIGN.—: Retrospective search for kidney biopsies with diagnosis of CaOx deposition was performed in our Renal Pathology Database between January 1, 2015 and October 15, 2018.\nRESULTS.—: Seventy-six biopsies with an increased number of CaOx deposits were identified. CaOx deposits were counted on slides from the frozen tissue (MTM fixed or fresh frozen) and from the formalin-fixed cores. The density of CaOx deposits was significantly higher in formalin-fixed cores (13.6 ± 10.0\/cm) than in MTM-fixed cores (3.2 ± 5.1\/cm;  < .001). CaOx density in the kidney biopsy specimens decreased progressively with increased fixation time in MTM. No significant differences in the CaOx density between formalin-fixed and fresh frozen tissue were observed.\nCONCLUSIONS.—: Our data demonstrate that fixation in MTM may result in a significant reduction in the number of CaOx deposits in a kidney biopsy specimen.

The prognostic ability of 34 baseline clinicopathologic parameters was evaluated using univariate and multivariate Cox regression analyses. The predictive accuracy and discriminative ability of the final model were measured using the calibration curve and concordance index (C-index). Internal validation of the model was assessed using bootstrap resampling.\nRESULTS: Urinary proteinuria excretion, stages of chronic kidney disease, glomerular hyalinosis, and extracapillary hypercellularity were independent prognostic factors for RS, and all were selected into the nomogram. The calibration curve for the probability of survival showed good agreement between the prediction by nomogram and actual observation. The C-index for predicting survival was 0.79 (95% confidence interval (CI) 0.72-0.86). A high C-index value of 0.76 indicated good internal validation.

The US-guided (ultrasound device: Toshiba Famio 5) kidney biopsy was performed using an automatic biopsy instrument FAST-GUN® with needle 16G. Kidney tissue samples were analyzed by light microscopy and immunofluorescence.\nRESULTS: In 18 patients with type 2 DM, the average duration of the disease was 5.9 years, 5 patients had a retinopathy, and 16 patients had hypertension. Biopsy indications were: nephrotic syndrome in 11 patients, asymptomatic urinary abnormalities in 3 patients, and rapid chronic renal failure progression.

The most frequent primary diagnoses were pauci-immune crescentic glomerulonephritis (GN; 12%), acute interstitial nephritis (10.8%) and membranous GN (7.1%). Death-censored renal survival at 1 and 5 years following the index biopsy was 85.2 and 75.9%, respectively, and patient survival at 1 and 5 years was 92.2 and 71.6%, respectively. Patients who progressed to end-stage renal disease (ESRD) were at higher risk of dying compared with patients who did not require dialysis [hazard ratio 2.41 (95% confidence interval 1.58-3.68; P < 0.001]. On multivariate analysis, factors associated with the risk of progression to ESRD were creatinine (P < 0.001), heavy proteinuria (P = 0.002) and a non-chronic kidney disease (CKD) biopsy indication (P = 0.006). A histological diagnosis of primary GN (P = 0.001) or tubulointerstitial nephritis (P = 0.008) was associated with a favourable renal outcome, while patients with vasculitis and paraprotein-related renal disease (PPRD) had the highest risk of requiring dialysis (P = 0.0002 and P = 0.003, respectively). PPRD was also an independent risk factor for death.\nCONCLUSIONS: This study demonstrates that renal biopsies in the elderly not only enable directed therapy, but also provide prognostic information on renal and patient survival.",

        "Abstract":"Dysproteinemic kidney diseases occur when B- or plasma cell clones produce pathogenic monoclonal immunoglobulins or light chains that cause kidney damage. The clinical presentation of these disorders ranges from sub-nephrotic-range proteinuria or microscopic hematuria with preserved kidney function to severe nephrotic syndrome to severe acute kidney injury or rapidly progressive glomerulonephritis. These monoclonal immunoglobulins can cause a variety of histologic patterns of injury, including cast nephropathy, glomerular and tubular deposition diseases, amyloidosis, and inflammatory glomerulonephritis. The underlying clonal disorder may meet criteria for overt multiple myeloma or systemic lymphoma. In recent years, there has been increased recognition and study of dysproteinemic kidney diseases that occur in the setting of smaller clonal plasma and B-cell populations, which are classified as monoclonal gammopathies of renal significance. Regardless of clonal cell burden, the goal of treatment is to achieve a hematologic response (ie, improvement or resolution of the monoclonal protein) by eradicating the underlying clone. Organ-specific responses are dependent on achieving hematologic response. Without appropriate treatment, many of these disorders are associated with high rates of progressive kidney disease and end-stage kidney disease. In this installment of AJKD's Core Curriculum in Nephrology, we review the pathogenesis, diagnosis, and treatment of dysproteinemic kidney diseases.",

The three patients enrolled had an average age of 43 years (with a range from 33 to 58 years). The diagnosis of Still's disease was retained on the basis of febrile polyarthritis (3 cases) associated with fleeting rush (1 case), biologic inflammatory syndrome in the absence of any infectious, inflammatory or neoplastic causes. All patients were treated with corticosteroids secondarily associated with methotrexate due to destructive polyarthritis (2 cases) and to a recurrence (1 case). Renal amyloidosis had occurred 4.9 years after Still's disease (with a range from 33 months to 7 years). Amyloidosis was revealed by nephrotic syndrome (3 cases) associated with renal failure (1 case). Diagnosis was based on renal puncture biopsy (3 cases) which showed AA amyloidosis (2 cases) and untyped amyloidosis (1 case). All patients received colchicine.

The relationship between BMI and primary glomerular disease (GN) may be more complex. We aimed to evaluate the association between BMI and renal disease progression in patients with primary glomerular disease (GN).\nMETHODS: This was a single-centre retrospective cohort study performed in adult patients with biopsy-proven primary GN (excluding minimal change disease) from January 2000 to December 2015, with follow-up data until June 2017. BMI at time of biopsy was categorised as ≤25 kg\/m, > 25 to ≤30 kg\/m and > 30 kg\/m. We used univariate and multivariate survival analyses to evaluate factors associated with progression to a composite endpoint of stage 5 CKD or renal replacement therapy (Major Adverse Renal Event - MARE) censoring for competing risk of death using Fine and Gray subdistribution hazards model.\nRESULTS: We included 560 patients with biopsy-proven primary GN and available BMI data: 66.1% were male with median age 54.8 (IQR 41.1-66.2) years and BMI 28.2 (IQR 24.9-32.1) kg\/m. Those with BMI 25-30 kg\/m (n = 210) and with BMI > 30 kg\/m (n = 207) were older (p = 0.007) with higher systolic and diastolic blood pressures (p = 0.02 and 0.004 respectively) than those with BMI < 25 kg\/m (n = 132).

Identifying the types of renal lesions can help in identifying the high-risk patients and appropriate treatment can be provided. Glomerulonephritis (GN) is considered one of the leading causes of end-stage renal disease in Saudi Arabia. The prevalence of different renal lesions were identified by different reports; however, these reports showed inconsistency. One important reason for such differences is related to the lack of unified methods in diagnosing and processing renal tissues and to the fact that different reports were reported by different pathologists. In addition, the differences in the reported results may reflect patient selection biases for renal biopsy or to the different policies and protocols adopted by different nephrologists. This is a prospective, multicenter study that involves different patients from different institutes and from different regions in Saudi Arabia to delineate the pattern of renal diseases based on renal biopsies. Four hundred and five cases were selected and studied over two years. This preliminary report shows that the most common primary renal lesion in Saudi Arabia is focal segmental glomerulosclerosis in 24.1%, followed by IgA nephropathy (15.2%), mesangioproliferative non-IgA, (13.2%), and membranoproliferative GN (12.4%).

        "Abstract":"INTRODUCTION: Arterial calcification (AC) is a common complication in chronic kidney disease (CKD) patients that starts to develop before these patients need renal replacement therapy. In these patients, calcification can involve tunica intima or tunica media. This study has looked for the prevalence, severity, and distribution of arterial wall calcification in incident hemodialysis patients through intraoperative arterial biopsy obtained during creation of arteriovenous vascular access for hemodialysis.\nMETHODOLOGY: One hundred and seventy-two stage 5 CKD adults (98 male and 74 female) were included. Beside histopathology of the obtained arterial samples, all these cases were tested for serum calcium (Ca), phosphorus (P), alkaline phosphatase, uric acid, parathormone (PTH), fibroblast growth factor 23 (FGF23), and 25 hydroxy vitamin D.\nRESULTS: Eighty six (50%) of the cases had AC (group I); 29 (17%) as intimal (subgroup Ii), 36 (21%) as medial (subgroup Im), while 21 (12%) had both intimal and medial calcification (subgroup Iim). Eighty-six patients (50%) were devoid of calcification (group II). Apart from the significantly higher serum level of PTH in group I, statistical analysis failed to disclose significant difference in any of the other studied parameters between the 2 groups. On the other hand, there were significant differences in serum P, Ca × P product, serum PTH, and FGF23 between patients according to intensity of calcification.\nCONCLUSION: Half of incident hemodialysis CKD patients have developed AC mainly in tunica media. Discrepancy in serum P can have an impact on calcification intensity.",

However, the time course of CCE-related renal deterioration varies and little is known about the subsequent risk of dialysis among patients with biopsy-proven CCE.\nMETHODS: We performed a retrospective cohort study of 38 Japanese patients in whom a histological diagnosis of CCE was made from September 1992 to July 2005. Competing risk regression analysis was used to investigate the association between declining renal function ( ≥ 1.5 elevation of serum creatinine within 26 weeks after CCE) or its subtypes (acute [ < 1 week after CCE], subacute [1 to < 6 weeks], and chronic [6 to < 26 weeks]) and the risk of dialysis, with adjustment for age, baseline serum creatinine, and the precipitating event (iatrogenic or spontaneous).\nRESULTS: During a median follow-up period of 25.9 weeks, 14 patients (35.9%) started dialysis. Multivariable analysis showed that patients with declining renal function had a higher risk of commencing dialysis than those without declining function (subdistribution hazard ratio [SHR] 9.47; 95% confidence interval [CI] 1.34-66.8). Patients with different renal presentations had a similarly increased risk of commencing dialysis, with the risk being significantly higher for the subacute and chronic patterns of declining renal function (adjusted SHR [95% CI] for acute, subacute, and chronic declining renal function[vs. no decline]: 7.36 [0.85-63.6], 11.9 [1.36-101], and 10.7 [1.49-77.0], respectively).\nCONCLUSION: Declining renal function after CCE, even later than 6 weeks, was significantly associated with the subsequent risk of dialysis.",

Phenotypes assigned by precise histology were: acute rejection (AR), interstitial fibrosis\/tubular atrophy\/chronic rejection (CR), excellent functioning transplants (TX), and glomerulonephritis recurrence (GN). Samples were analyzed on microarrays and profiles from each cohort were cross-validated on the other cohort with similar phenotypes. We discovered signatures for each tissue: (1) AR vs TX, (2) CR vs TX, and (3) GN vs TX using the Random Forests algorithm. We validated biopsies signatures of AR vs TX (area under the curve [AUC] 0.97) and CR vs TX (AUC 0.87). We also validated both PB and Bx signatures of AR vs TX and CR vs TX with varying degrees of accuracy. Several biological pathways were shared between AR and CR, suggesting similar rejection mechanisms in these 2 clinical phenotypes. Thus, we identified gene expression signatures for AR and CR in transplant patients and validated them in independent cohorts of significantly different racial\/ethnic backgrounds. These results reveal that there are strong unifying immune mechanisms driving transplant diseases and identified in the signatures discovered in each cohort, suggesting that molecular diagnostics across populations are feasible despite ethnic and environmental differences.",

This study evaluated the incidence of thyroid disease and cancer in a population of kidney transplant recipients performed in a single center.\nMETHODS: Seven hundred sixty patients receiving a kidney transplantation between January 2000 and October 2017 were followed with thyroid ultrasonography to determine nodules together with thyroid hormone levels. Ultrasound-guided fine-needle aspiration citology (FNAc) was performed to the nodules > 10 mm .\nRESULTS: Two hundred four patients (26.8%) patients demonstrated functional or morphologic changes in the thyroid gland compared with pre-transplant period. Among the 204 patients with newly diagnosed thyroid disease, 165 patients had single or multiple nodular lesions less than 1 cm in diameter, and were followed yearly. Nodule size progression was observed in 23 patients (13.9%), and they underwent a FNAc. A total of sixty-two patients (30.3%) underwent FNAc. The biopsy samples were cytologically interpreted as benign in 20 patients (32.2%), suspicious in 40 patients (64.5%), or at high risk of cancer in 2 patients (3.2%). Forty-two patients underwent total thyroidectomy. At histological examination, 18 patients had a thyroid cancer (papillary cancer in 17 patients, follicular cancer in one). Thyroid cancer was more frequent in male patients with a mean time from transplant to diagnosis of 5.6 years. At a mean follow-up was 8 ± 1.2 years, all patients are alive with a normal functioning graft.\nCONCLUSIONS: Thyroid diseases are common in transplant recipients. Thyroid disease may evolve after transplantation, probably as a consequence of immunosuppression. A complete evaluation of thyroid disease is mandatory in kidney transplant recipients because early diagnosis and appropriate treatment of thyroid disease and cancer may significantly decrease the morbidity and mortality in these patients.",

We developed a two murine models of unilateral renal ischemia to match a recently published human study that investigated renal injury after unilateral renal ischemia during partial nephrectomy.\nMETHODS: Eight 10-week-old C57BL\/6 male mice underwent left UiAKI or sham procedure, with or without intra-operative ice packs. Functional, histological, and biomarker outcomes were followed at 2, 6 and 24 hours, or 14 or 28 days later. The 14 and 28 day cohorts were duplicated such that contralateral nephrectomy could be performed 3 days prior to sacrifice with functional measurements obtained to isolate the glomerular filtration rate of the injured kidney.\nRESULTS: The short-term outcomes correlated with the human study findings with urine and serum biomarkers of injury peaking around 24 hours and then normalizing, and reassuring immediate histological outcomes. Functional and histological outcomes at the later time-points (14 and 28 days) demonstrate an increase in fibrosis markers, and a reduction in glomerular filtration rate in the injured kidney, corresponding to the duration of ischemia, while serum and urine biomarkers remained reassuring.\nCONCLUSIONS: Our findings suggest that clinically available biomarkers of renal function are falsely reassuring against long-term injury following UiAKI, and that the duration of ischemia correlates with impaired function and increased fibrosis.",

        "Abstract":"BACKGROUND: Autosomal dominant tubulointerstitial kidney disease (ADTKD) caused by UMOD gene mutation (ADTKD-UMOD) is rare in children, characterized by hyperuricemia, gout, and progressive chronic kidney disease. It usually leads to end-stage renal failure at fiftieth decades. Here, we report a 3-year-old Chinese boy in an ADTKD family caused by a novel UMOD gene mutation.\nCASE PRESENTATION: A 3-year-old boy was admitted to our hospital because of persistent hematuria. Urinalysis showed BLD 2+ without proteinuria. The serum levels of uric acid, creatinine and electrolytes were normal. No renal cyst or calculus was found by ultrasonography. Renal biopsy was performed and focal and segmental glomerulosclerosis was found in 4 glomeruli among 35 glomeruli examined. His father was found with end-stage renal disease (ESRD) at the age of 29, and renal ultrasound showed several cysts in both kidneys. A novel heterozygous mutation (c.1648G > A,p.V550I) in exon 8 of UMOD gene was identified by whole exome sequencing in the family. SCBC Genome Browser alignment showed that V550 were highly conserved in uromodulin among different species. Software predicted that the mutation is suspected to be harmful. By literature review, there are 12 mutations of UMOD gene in 14 Chinese families including only one pediatric case(a 16-year-old girl).\nCONCLUSIONS: A novel heterozygous mutation (c.1648G > A,p.V550I) in exon 8 of UMOD gene was found in in a Chinese child case with ADTKD-UMOD, which extends our understanding of UMOD gene mutation spectrum and phenotype of ADTKD-UMOD in children.",

        "Abstract":"The role of endothelial cells in the pathophysiology of antibody-mediated rejection after renal transplantation has been widely investigated. We expand this scenario to the impact of epithelial cells on the microenvironment during rejection. Primary proximal tubular epithelial cells were stimulated via HLA class I, CD155 and CD166 based on their potential signal-transducing capacity to mediate back signaling after encounter with either T\/NK cells or donor-specific antibodies. Upon crosslinking of these ligands with mAbs, PTEC secreted IL-6, CXCL1,8,10, CCL2, and sICAM-1. These proteins were also released by PTEC as consequence of a direct interaction with T\/NK cells. Downmodulation of the receptor CD226 on effector cells confirmed the involvement of this receptor\/ligand pair in back signaling. In vivo, CD155 and CD166 expression was detectable in proximal and distal tubuli of renal transplant biopsies, respectively. The composition of the protein microenvironment in these biopsies showed a substantial overlap with the PTEC response. Cluster and principal component analyses of the microenvironment separated unsuspicious from rejection biopsies and, furthermore, ABMR, TCMR, and borderline rejection. In conclusion, our results provide evidence that epithelial cells may contribute to the rejection process and pave the way to a better understanding of the pathomechanisms of kidney allograft rejection.",

We analyzed our renal biopsy registry over a period of 15 years. We retrospectively reviewed all the renal biopsies performed at Arun Kidney Centre, Vijayawada, Andhra Pradesh, from January 2004 to March 2018. All biopsies were analyzed using immunofluorescence and light microscopy. A total of 924 renal biopsies were considered for the analysis. The mean age of the patients was 32 ± 14.77 years, with a male:female ratio of 1.5:1. Nephrotic syndrome (46.1%) was the most common indication for renal biopsy, followed by rapidly progressive renal failure (11%) and rapidly progressive glomerulonephritis (9.9%). Primary glomerulonephritis (PGN) was the most common entity (66.8%), followed by tubulointerstitial disease (17.5%), secondary glomerulonephritis (SGN) (12.1%), and vascular nephropathies (3.5%). Among cases with PGN, the most common causes were minimal change disease (22.98%), immunoglobulin A nephropathy (21.3%), and membranous nephropathy (17%), whereas the most common SGN was lupus nephritis (60.7%). Acute tubulointerstitial nephritis (61.1%) was the most common tubulointerstitial disease, whereas antineutrophil cytoplasmic antibody vasculitis (56.3%) was the most common vascular nephropathy. We also noticed significant changing trends in many nephropathies. Our study provides epidemiologic data regarding the various BPRDs and also the changing trends of the individual renal diseases.",

We aimed to evaluate the impact of desmopressin prophylaxis on severe hyponatremia and bleeding after kidney biopsies in individuals with renal impairment.\nMETHOD: This is a single-center retrospective cohort study of consecutive adults with serum creatinine ≥ 150 µmol\/L and had ultrasound-guided percutaneous native or transplant kidney biopsies between June 2011 and July 2015. Data were retrieved from electronic medical records. Primary outcomes were the use of desmopressin prophylaxis and severe hyponatremia (serum sodium ≤ 125 mmol\/L) within 7 days post-biopsy. Secondary outcome was post-biopsy bleeding.\nRESULTS: 240 native kidney and 196 allograft biopsies were performed. Median age was 51 (IQR 42.3, 60) years and eGFR was 21.9 (12.9, 30.1) ml\/min\/1.73 m. Although patients prescribed desmopressin prophylaxis (n = 226) had higher serum creatinine [279 (201, 392) vs. 187 (160, 241), p < 0.001], bleeding (15.0% vs. 13.3%, p = 0.60) was not significantly different with and without desmopressin. Severe hyponatremia occurred in 30 biopsies (6.9%) with nadir serum sodium level of 122 (119, 124) mmol\/L at 3 (2, 5) days after biopsy, more frequently among those with desmopressin prophylaxis (10.7% vs. 3.0%, p = 0.002). Multi-variate analysis found that pre-biopsy serum sodium level [adjusted OR 0.80 (95% CI 0.72, 0.90), p < 0.001] and desmopressin prophylaxis [adjusted OR 4.02 (95% CI 1.58, 10.21), p = 0.003] were independently associated with severe hyponatremia after kidney biopsy.\nCONCLUSION: Pre-biopsy desmopressin was associated with severe hyponatremia in individuals with renal impairment; hence, susceptible patients given desmopressin should be closely monitored.",

        "Abstract":"Idiopathic membranous nephropathy (iMN) is the major cause of end-stage renal disease (ESRD). Recent guidelines suggest limiting immunosuppressants only to high risk patients for ESRD. The present study is aimed at identifying new predictors for the renal outcome of iMN patients. We conducted a retrospective cohort study covering a period from January 2003 to December 2013. We enrolled participants who had received their first renal biopsy at our medical center in Taiwan with the diagnosis of iMN. Clinical, pathological and laboratory data were collected from medical records. Analyses with Mann-Whitney U test was used for continuous variables and Chi-square test for categorical variables. The Kaplan-Meier curve was used for the analyses of patient survival and renal survival. Youden index was used for evaluating the performance of a dichotomous diagnostic test for renal and patient outcomes. Cox proportional hazard regression was used to determine factors affecting renal survival.A total of 99 patients with renal biopsy-confirmed idiopathic iMNs were enrolled. C3 level ≤114 mg\/dl predicted patient outcome (p < 0.001) with good predictive power (AUC = 0.736). The univariate analysis showed that risk factors for poor renal outcome were older age (HR = 1.04, p = 0.002), high BUN (HR = 1.03, p < 0.001), poor baseline renal function (HR = 1.30 and p < 0.001 for higher serum creatinine; HR = 0.97 and p < 0.001 for higher eGFR; HR = 1.06 and p < 0.001 for urine PCR), C3 ≤ 93.4 mg\/dl (HR = 2.15, p = 0.017), NLR > 3.34 (HR = 3.30, p < 0.001) and PLR > 14.48 (HR = 2.54, p = 0.003). Stage of iMN did not fully account for the risk of ESRD. This is the first evidence that serum levels of C3 ≤ 93.4 mg\/dl predicted poor renal outcomes with good predictive power.

Although some studies have suggested that mortality appears to be increased in IgAN, such studies lacked matched controls and did not report absolute risk.\nMETHODS: We conducted a population-based cohort study in Sweden, involving patients with biopsy-verified IgAN diagnosed in 1974-2011; main outcome measures were death and ESRD. Using data from three national registers, we linked 3622 patients with IgAN with 18,041 matched controls; we also conducted a sibling analysis using 2773 patients with IgAN with 6210 siblings and a spousal analysis that included 2234 pairs.\nRESULTS: During a median follow-up of 13.6 years, 577 (1.1%) patients with IgAN died (10.67 per 1000 person-years) compared with 2066 deaths (0.7%) in the reference population during a median follow-up of 14.1 years (7.45 per 1000 person-years). This corresponded to a 1.53-fold increased risk and an absolute excess mortality of 3.23 per 1000 person-years (equaling one extra death per 310 person-years) and a 6-year reduction in median life expectancy. Similar increases in risk were seen in comparisons with siblings and spouses. IgAN was associated with one extra case of ESRD per 54 person-years. Mortality preceding ESRD was not significantly increased compared with controls, spouses, or siblings. Overall mortality did not differ significantly between patients with IgAN-associated ESRD and patients with ESRD from other causes.\nCONCLUSIONS: Patients with IgAN have an increased mortality compared with matched controls, with one extra death per 310 person-years and a 6-year reduction in life expectancy.",

        "Abstract":"The current Banff scoring system was not developed to predict graft loss and may not be ideal for use in clinical trials aimed at improving allograft survival. We hypothesized that scoring histologic features of digitized renal allograft biopsies using a continuous, more objective, computer-assisted morphometric (CAM) system might be more predictive of graft loss. We performed a nested case-control study in kidney transplant recipients with a surveillance biopsy obtained 5 years after transplantation. Patients that developed death-censored graft loss (n = 67) were 2:1 matched on age, gender, and follow-up time to controls with surviving grafts (n = 134). The risk of graft loss was compared between CAM-based models vs a model based on Banff scores. Both Banff and CAM identified chronic lesions associated with graft loss (chronic glomerulopathy, arteriolar hyalinosis, and mesangial expansion). However, the CAM-based models predicted graft loss better than the Banff-based model, both overall (c-statistic 0.754 vs 0.705, P < .001), and in biopsies without chronic glomerulopathy (c-statistic 0.738 vs 0.661, P < .001) where it identified more features predictive of graft loss (% luminal stenosis and % mesangial expansion). Using 5-year renal allograft surveillance biopsies, CAM-based models predict graft loss better than Banff models and might be developed into biomarkers for future clinical trials.",

Microalbuminuria is common in children with SCD, while a smaller number of children have more severe renal manifestations necessitating kidney biopsy. There is limited information on renal biopsy findings in children with SCD and subsequent management and outcome.\nMETHODS: This is a multicenter retrospective analysis of renal biopsy findings and clinical outcomes in children and adolescents with SCD. We included children and adolescents (age ≤ 20 years) with SCD who had a kidney biopsy performed at a pediatric nephrology unit. The clinical indication for biopsy, biopsy findings, subsequent treatments, and outcomes were analyzed.\nRESULTS: Thirty-six SCD patients (ages 4-19 years) were identified from 14 centers with a median follow-up of 2.6 years (0.4-10.4 years). The indications for biopsy were proteinuria (92%) and elevated creatinine (30%). All biopsies had abnormal findings, including mesangial hypercellularity (75%), focal segmental glomerulosclerosis (30%), membranoproliferative glomerulonephritis (16%), and thrombotic microangiopathy (2%). There was increased use of hydroxyurea, angiotensin-converting-enzyme inhibitors, and angiotensin receptor blockers following renal biopsy. At last follow-up, 3 patients were deceased, 2 developed insulin-dependent diabetes mellitus, 6 initiated chronic hemodialysis, 1 received a bone marrow transplant, and 1 received a kidney transplant.\nCONCLUSIONS: Renal biopsies, while not commonly performed in children with SCD, were universally abnormal. Outcomes were poor in this cohort of patients despite a variety of post-biopsy interventions. Effective early intervention to prevent chronic kidney disease (CKD) is needed to reduce morbidity and mortality in children with SCD.",

HUA is associated with an increased risk of cardiovascular events and accelerates the progression of CKD. Our study aimed to explore the relationship between baseline serum uric acid levels and renal histopathological features.\nMETHODS: One thousand seventy patients receiving renal biopsy in our center were involved in our study. The baseline characteristics at the time of the kidney biopsy were collected from Renal Treatment System (RTS) database, including age, gender, serum uric acid (UA), glomerular filtration rate (eGFR), serum creatinine (Cr), urea, albumin (Alb), 24 h urine protein quantitation (24 h-u-pro) and blood pressure (BP). Pathological morphological changes were evaluated by two pathologists independently. Statistical analysis was done using SPSS 21.0.\nRESULTS: Among 1070 patients, 429 had IgA nephropathy (IgAN), 641 had non-IgAN. The incidence of HUA was 38.8% (n = 415), 43.8% (n = 188), and 43.2% (n = 277) in all patients, patients with IgAN and non-IgAN patients, respectively. Serum uric acid was correlated with eGFR (r = - 0.418, p < 0.001), Cr (r = 0.391, p < 0.001), urea (r = 0.410, p < 0.001), 24-u-pro (r = 0.077, p = 0.022), systolic blood pressure (SBP) (r = 0.175, p < 0.001) and diastolic blood pressure (DBP) (r = 0.109, p = 0.001). Multivariate logistic regression analysis showed that after adjustment for Cr, age and blood pressure, HUA was a risk factor for segmental glomerulosclerosis (OR = 1.800, 95% CI:1.309-2.477) and tubular atrophy\/interstitial fibrosis (OR = 1.802, 95% CI:1.005-3.232). HUA increased the area under curve (AUC) in diagnosis of segmental glomerulosclerosis.\nCONCLUSIONS: Hyperuricemia is prevalent in CKD.

We also examined the use of automated report sign-outs and the agreement between multiple human interpreters of the molecular results. Ensembles generated diagnoses that were both more accurate than the best individual classifiers, and nearly as stable as the best, consistent with expectations from the machine learning literature. Human experts had ≈93% agreement (balanced accuracy) signing out the reports, and random forest-based automated sign-outs showed similar levels of agreement with the human experts (92% and 94% for predicting the expert MMDx sign-outs for T cell-mediated (TCMR) and antibody-mediated rejection (ABMR), respectively). In most cases disagreements, whether between experts or between experts and automated sign-outs, were in biopsies near diagnostic thresholds. Considerable disagreement with histology persisted. The balanced accuracies of MMDx sign-outs for histology diagnoses of TCMR and ABMR were 73% and 78%, respectively. Disagreement with histology is largely due to the known noise in histology assessments (ClinicalTrials.gov NCT01299168).",

        "Abstract":"OBJECTIVE: Clinicopathological characteristics, renal prognosis, and mortality in patients with type 2 diabetes and reduced renal function without overt proteinuria are scarce.\nRESEARCH DESIGN AND METHODS: We retrospectively assessed 526 patients with type 2 diabetes and reduced renal function (estimated glomerular filtration rate [eGFR] <60 mL\/min\/1.73 m), who underwent clinical renal biopsy and had follow-up data, from Japan's nationwide multicenter renal biopsy registry. For comparative analyses, we derived one-to-two cohorts of those without proteinuria versus those with proteinuria using propensity score-matching methods addressing the imbalances of age, sex, diabetes duration, and baseline eGFR. The primary end point was progression of chronic kidney disease (CKD) defined as new-onset end-stage renal disease, decrease of eGFR by ≥50%, or doubling of serum creatinine. The secondary end point was all-cause mortality.\nRESULTS: Eighty-two patients with nonproteinuria (urine albumin-to-creatinine ratio [UACR] <300 mg\/g) had lower systolic blood pressure and less severe pathological lesions compared with 164 propensity score-matched patients with proteinuria (UACR ≥300 mg\/g). After a median follow-up of 1.9 years (interquartile range 0.9-5.0 years) from the date of renal biopsy, the 5-year CKD progression-free survival was 86.6% (95% CI 72.5-93.8) for the nonproteinuric group and 30.3% (95% CI 22.4-38.6) for the proteinuric group (log-rank test  < 0.001). The lower renal risk was consistent across all subgroup analyses. The all-cause mortality was also lower in the nonproteinuric group (log-rank test  = 0.005).\nCONCLUSIONS: Patients with nonproteinuric diabetic kidney disease had better-controlled blood pressure and fewer typical morphological changes and were at lower risk of CKD progression and all-cause mortality.",

        "Published":"2019-02-14",
        "Abstract":"BACKGROUND: Proliferative glomerulonephritis with monoclonal IgG deposits (PGNMIGD) is a disease entity classified under the group of \"Monoclonal gammopathy-related kidney diseases\", and can recur after transplant. Clinical remission of proteinuria in patients with PGNMIGD has been previously shown following anti-B cell and\/or anti-plasma cell therapies. Our case is the first to show complete histologic resolution of the glomerular monoclonal IgG kappa deposits in a case of recurrent PGNMIGD in renal allograft after rituximab and steroid treatment. This is a novel finding and it shows that the deposits are amenable to therapy. This case also highlights the importance of IgG subclass staining in the recognition of the monoclonal nature of the deposits. It is particularly important in PGNMIGD because only 20 to 30% of patients with this disease are reported to have detectable monoclonal gammopathy, and the deposits do not have any organized substructure on electron microscopic examination. Morphologically, they resemble polyclonal immune-type deposits seen in other immune complex glomerulonephritides such as lupus nephritis, infection-associated glomerulonephritis, and membranoproliferative glomerulonephritis (MPGN type I).\nCASE PRESENTATION: The patient is a 44 year old Caucasian male who received a living unrelated donor kidney transplant for end-stage renal disease diagnosed 7 years before transplant. The reported native kidney biopsy diagnosis was membranoproliferative glomerulonephritis (MPGN) with IgG, C3 and kappa restricted deposits. Fourteen months post-transplant, he presented with abrupt worsening of graft function, proteinuria and serum IgG kappa monoclonal spike. Allograft biopsy was consistent with recurrent PGNMIGD, considering the native kidney diagnosis and interval post-transplant. He underwent plasmapheresis, IV pooled immune globulin, steroid pulse and taper, and anti-CD-20 Rituximab therapy. Patient had gradual decline in proteinuria and complete resolution of the immune deposits on repeat biopsy 3 months later. Unfortunately he subsequently developed chronic antibody-mediated rejection and transplant glomerulopathy and graft failure 34 months post-transplant.\nCONCLUSIONS: In a transplant setting, repeat allograft biopsies are frequently performed for graft dysfunction. This provides a good opportunity to study the evolution of the immune deposits following treatment. Our case shows complete histologic resolution of the deposits in allograft PGNMIGD.",

        "Abstract":"BACKGROUND: Anti-neutrophil cytoplasmic autoantibody (ANCA)-associated vasculitis (AAV) is a multisystem autoimmune disorder associated with significant morbidity and mortality. Approximately 80-90% of patients have circulating ANCAs. Long-term outcomes appear to be improving. This retrospective study analyses the incidence and patient outcomes over a period of 23 years at a single tertiary centre.\nMETHODS: Outcomes of patients diagnosed with AAV between 1 January 1988 and 31 December 2010 were collected retrospectively. Data including patient demographics, age of diagnosis, dates of starting renal replacement therapy, death and biochemistry results were collected. Patients were divided into two cohorts (1988-99 and 2000-10) and analysed using Stata software (StataCorp, College Station, TX, USA).\nRESULTS: A complete dataset was obtained for 273 patients. Of these patients, 101 were diagnosed between 1988 and 1999 while 172 were diagnosed between 2000 and 2010. The number of patients diagnosed with AAV increased from 2.2\/million in 1988 to 10.3\/million in 2010. A higher proportion of patients (56.4%) in the earlier cohort presented with creatinine >500 μmol\/L compared with the later cohort (30.2%; P < 0.001). Overall patient survival improved significantly between the two cohorts. Cohort 1 had a median survival of 59 months compared with 125 months for Cohort 2 (P = 0.003).\nCONCLUSIONS: This study shows that AAV is being diagnosed at an earlier stage, resulting in improved outcomes. This may be because of improvements in the management of AAV and chronic kidney disease.",

        "Abstract":"BACKGROUND: Only a few prospective trials exist regarding the use of novel direct-acting antiviral agents (DAAs) in kidney transplant recipients (KTR) with chronic hepatitis C virus (HCV) infection.\nMETHODS: This prospective single-center trial evaluated treatment with daclatasvir (DCV) and sofosbuvir (SOF) over 12 weeks in 16 adult chronic HCV infected KTR and eGFR > 30 ml\/min\/1.73m. Primary endpoint was sustained virological response 12 weeks after end of therapy (SVR12). Beside baseline liver biopsy, hepatic function and glucose metabolism were regularly assessed.\nRESULTS: Four of 16 study patients had previously failed interferon-based HCV treatment. Liver biopsy showed mostly moderate fibrosis score before therapy with DCV\/SOF was initiated at a median of 10.3 years after transplantation. In total, 15 of 16 KTR achieved SVR12. One patient showed early viral relapse because of resistance-associated variants (RAVs) in the HCV NS5A region. Rescue treatment with SOF\/velpatasvir\/voxilaprevir resulted in SVR12. DAAs treatment led to significant improvement of liver metabolism and glucose tolerance accompanied with no therapy-associated major adverse events and excellent tolerability.\nCONCLUSIONS: Our study demonstrates safety, efficacy and functional benefit of DCV\/SOF treatment in KTR with chronic HCV infection. We provide data on rescue strategies for treatment failures due to present RAVs and amelioration of hepatic function and glucose tolerance.\nTRIAL REGISTRATION: Registry name: European Clinical Trials Register; Trial registry number (Eudra-CT): 2014-004551-32 , Registration date: Aug 28th 2015.",

        "Abstract":"['2', '2', '2', '2']\nMorbid obesity, defined as body mass index (BMI) ≥40 kg\/m, affects approximately 8% of United States adults and is a recognized risk factor for chronic kidney disease (CKD). We present the first focused biopsy-based study exploring the range of kidney diseases in this population. Among 3263 native kidney biopsies interpreted at Columbia University in 2017, we identified 248 biopsies from morbidly obese patients. In this cohort with median age of 53.5 years, 56% were female and median BMI was 44.0 kg\/m. Diabetes and hypertension were present in 47% and 81% of patients, respectively. Median estimated glomerular filtration rate (eGFR) was 30 ml\/min\/1.73 m, and most patients had nephrotic range proteinuria. Obesity related glomerulopathy (ORG), defined as focal segmental glomerulosclerosis with glomerulomegaly or glomerulomegaly alone, was detected in 73 patients, including 29 with ORG alone and 44 with ORG plus another kidney disease. In contrast, 167 patients had other kidney diseases alone, without ORG, most commonly (in descending order) diabetic nephropathy, acute tubular necrosis, hypertensive nephrosclerosis, IgA nephropathy, membranous nephropathy, and lupus nephritis. In 49% of patients, kidney biopsy yielded a diagnosis predicted to change patient management. The strongest predictor of non-ORG lesions was eGFR <30 ml\/min per 1.73 m, and presentation with nephrotic syndrome or acute kidney injury (with or without background CKD) was more common in non-ORG than ORG. The findings reveal an unexpectedly broad spectrum of kidney pathology beyond metabolic syndrome-associated disorders and highlight the importance of kidney biopsy to guide management and prognosis in the morbidly obese population.",

        "Abstract":"BACKGROUND: Thin basement membrane nephropathy (TBMN) is diagnosed by diffuse thinning of the glomerular basement membrane (GBM) without any clinical and pathologic findings of Alport syndrome and the other renal diseases. TBMN is characterized clinically by benign familial hematuria but rarely develops into end-stage renal disease.\nMETHODS: In 27 cases of biopsy-proven TBMN, we evaluated the pathologic characteristics of TBMN, and examined the correlation between these pathologic characterizations and renal dysfunction.\nRESULTS: All patients had hematuria, and 21 patients (77.8%) had proteinuria. In six patients (28.6%) who were more than 50 years of age, the estimated glomerular filtration rate (eGFR) decreased from G3a to G4 in the chronic kidney disease stage. Pathologically, an irregular decrease in intensity of type IV collagen α5(IV) chain was seen in GBM, and irregular thinning with diffuse rough etched images was observed on the GBM surface with several sizes of holes by low-vacuum scanning electron microscopy. The glomerular morphology of TBMN was characterized by an increased number of small glomerular capillaries with an increased extracellular matrix (ECM). These characteristic morphologic alterations were evident from a young age in patients with TBMN, but were not correlated directly with the decrease of eGFR, the degree of hematuria, and proteinuria. The decrease of eGFR in patients with TBMN who were more than 50 years of age might be primarily mediated by arteriolosclerosis-associated glomerulosclerosis and interstitial fibrosis.\nCONCLUSION: Characteristic pathological glomerular findings and GBM alterations occurred from a young age but were not associated directly with renal impairment in biopsy-proven TBMN.",

Detailed clinical characterizations of patients with biopsy-proven disease are limited, and there is no current consensus on criteria for a noninvasive diagnosis.\nDESIGN, SETTING, PARTICIPANTS, & MEASUREMENTS: We designed a prospective study in a major Sri Lankan hospital servicing endemic areas to ascertain pathologic and clinical characteristics of and assess risk factors for primary tubulointerstitial kidney disease. We used logistic regression to determine whether common clinical characteristics could be used to predict the presence of primary tubulointerstitial kidney disease on kidney biopsy.\nRESULTS: From 600 new patients presenting to a tertiary nephrology clinic over the course of 1 year, 87 underwent kidney biopsy, and 43 (49%) had a biopsy diagnosis of primary tubulointerstitial kidney disease. On detailed biopsy review, 13 (30%) had evidence of moderate to severe active kidney disease, and six (15%) had evidence of moderate to severe chronic tubulointerstitial kidney disease. Patients with tubulointerstitial kidney disease were exclusively born in endemic provinces; 91% spent a majority of their lifespan there. They were more likely men and farmers (risk ratio, 2.0; 95% confidence interval, 1.2 to 2.9), and they were more likely to have used tobacco (risk ratio, 1.7; 95% confidence interval, 1.0 to 2.3) and well water (risk ratio, 1.5; 95% confidence interval, 1.1 to 2.0). Three clinical characteristics-age, urine dipstick for protein, and serum albumin-could predict likelihood of tubulointerstitial kidney disease on biopsy (model sensitivity of 79% and specificity of 84%). Patients referred for kidney biopsy despite comorbid diabetes or hypertension did not experience lower odds of tubulointerstitial kidney disease.\nCONCLUSIONS: A primary tubulointerstitial kidney disease occurs commonly in specific regions of Sri Lanka with characteristic environmental and lifestyle exposures.",

Here we reported the outcome of patients with biopsy-proved DMN compared to those with isolated crescentic glomerulonephritis (GN) or lupus nephritis (LN).\nMETHODS: This retrospective observational study included patients with DMN (n = 55), crescentic GN (n = 48) and LN (n = 82) from an original cohort of 987 adult patients who underwent kidney biopsy. The median follow-up period was 8.3 years. The Cox regression model was used to identify factors associated with the outcome measures of end-stage renal disease (ESRD) and all-cause mortality.\nRESULTS: Patients with DMN and crescentic GN exhibited higher rates of ESRD than LN group (65.5%, 66.7% versus 32.9%, p < 0.001). After accounting for the competing risk of death, DMN versus LN, along with lower hemoglobin values, lower estimated glomerular filtration rates and severe proteinuria were independent predictors for ESRD. Patients with DMN and crescentic GN displayed higher mortality rates than LN patients following the development of ESRD (38.2% and 29.2% versus 9.8%, p < 0.001). Multivariate analysis showed old age (≧65 years) and lower serum albumin levels were independently associated with overall death.\nCONCLUSIONS: Patients with biopsy-proved DMN, but not crescentic GN, showed a greater risk of ESRD than LN counterparts. Given the grave renal prognosis of DMN, more meticulous follow-up is critical to ensure that best therapeutic strategies are used to avert progression to ESRD.",

        "Abstract":"BACKGROUND: Increasing evidence suggests that individuals with low nephron number have an increased lifetime risk of renal insufficiency, thereby emphasizing the importance of evaluating total nephron number in each individual. In recent years, new methods have been described for estimating human total nephron number using a combination of image analysis and renal biopsy, though the reproducibility and accuracy of these methods remain uncertain. This study estimated total nephron number in healthy Japanese subjects using such a method.\nMETHODS: Implantation biopsies from 44 living kidney donors were analyzed. Using pre-donation contrast CT angiograms, transplantation donor kidneys were three-dimensionally reconstructed, and total renal cortical volume was estimated. Total nephron number was estimated based on glomerular density in biopsy specimens and total renal cortical volume. The obtained results were analyzed in relation to clinical variables and compared with those of a previously reported Japanese autopsy study.\nRESULTS: The estimated non-sclerotic and total numbers of glomeruli in this cohort were 650,000 ± 220,000 and 710,000 ± 220,000 (mean ± SD) per kidney. Non-sclerotic glomerular number ranged from 280,000 to 1,220,000 per kidney (4.4-fold) and correlated directly with eGFR (r = 0.328, p = 0.030) and inversely with age (r = - 0.355, p = 0.018).\nCONCLUSION: The estimated total nephron number obtained in the present study was 25% less than that reported in American living kidney donors obtained using the same procedure and similar to that obtained in a previous Japanese autopsy study using the disector\/fractionator method. These results confirm the feasibility of a combined CT angiography and biopsy-based method to estimate total nephron number in humans.",

        "Abstract":"Impairment of renal function often occurs in patients with liver disease. Hepatorenal syndrome is a significant cause of acute kidney injury (AKI) in patients with cirrhosis (HRS-AKI, type 1). Causes of non-HRS-AKI include cholemic nephropathy (CN), a disease that is characterized by intratubular bile casts and tubular injury. As data on patients with CN are obtained primarily from case reports or autopsy studies, we aimed to investigate the frequency and clinical course of CN. We identified 149 patients who underwent kidney biopsy between 2000 and 2016 at the Department of Gastroenterology, Hepatology and Endocrinology at Hannover Medical School. Of these, 79 had a history of liver disease and deterioration of renal function. When applying recent European Association for the Study of the Liver criteria, 45 of 79 patients (57%) presented with AKI, whereas 34 patients (43%) had chronic kidney disease (CKD). Renal biopsy revealed the diagnosis of CN in 8 of 45 patients with AKI (17.8%), whereas none of the patients with CKD was diagnosed with CN. Univariate analysis identified serum bilirubin, alkaline phosphatase, and urinary bilirubin and urobilinogen as predictive factors for the diagnosis of CN. Histological analysis of AKI patients with normal bilirubin, elevated bilirubin, and the diagnosis of CN revealed loss of aquaporin 2 (AQP2) expression in collecting ducts in patients with elevated bilirubin and CN. Biopsy-related complications requiring medical intervention occurred in 4 of 79 patients (5.1%). Conclusion: CN is a common finding in patients with liver disease, AKI, and highly elevated bilirubin. Loss of AQP2 in AKI patients with elevated bilirubin and CN might be the result of toxic effects of cholestasis and in part be responsible for the impairment of renal function.",

Of the 51 patients, 54.9% were male and 45.1% were female. The mean age was 50.8 (47.1-55.2) years; 86% were between 25 and 64 years old. Edema was the main clinical presentation (70.6%) with clinical urine changes in 84.3%. Diabetic retinopathy was present in 62.2% in ophthalmological examination of 44 patients. Majority (67.5%) of patients were in advanced chronic kidney disease Stages III, IV, and V. About one-quarter underwent hemodialysis at the time of admission. Majority (76.9%) were obese and hypertensive (78.4%). Low hemoglobin (51%), high triglyceride (35.7%), high total cholesterol (56.8%), low serum albumin (78.4%), nephrotic-range proteinuria (75.6%), and microscopic hematuria (77.1%) were the main laboratory findings.

About 24.4% had positive antinuclear antibody, 20.8% had positive anti-dsDNA, and 23.3% had positive extractable nuclear antigens. Also, p-antineutrophil cytoplasmic antibody (p-ANCA) was positive in 30% and c-ANCA was positive in 9.7%. This study represents the findings of the whole country for more than 10 years. It showed that only a small percentage of patients with DM undergo kidney biopsy. These patients have many clinical and laboratory abnormalities including those of specific immuno-logical investigations. Progression of DM nephropathy seems to be further aggravated by many coexisting risk factors of dyslipidemia and\/or obesity. The prevalence of non-DKD is remarkably frequent in diabetics in whom nephrologists should consider kidney biopsy as an appropriate measure to enable better management.",

        "Abstract":"Renal osteodystrophy (ROD), a group of metabolic bone diseases secondary to chronic kidney disease (CKD), still represents a great challenge to nephrologists. Its management is tailored by the type of bone lesion - of high or low turnover - that cannot be accurately predicted by serum biomarkers of bone remodeling available in daily clinical practice, mainly parathyroid hormone (PTH) and alkaline phosphatase (AP). In view of this limitation, bone biopsy followed by bone quantitative histomorphometry, the gold-standard method for the diagnosis of ROD, is still considered of paramount importance. Bone biopsy has also been recommended for evaluation of osteoporosis in the CKD setting to help physicians choose the best anti-osteoporotic drug. Importantly, bone biopsy is the sole diagnostic method capable of providing dynamic information on bone metabolism. Trabecular and cortical bones may be analyzed separately by evaluating their structural and dynamic parameters, thickness and porosity, respectively. Deposition of metals, such as aluminum and iron, on bone may also be detected. Despite of these unique characteristics, the interest on bone biopsy has declined over the last years and there are currently few centers around the world specialized on bone histomorphometry. In this review, we will discuss the bone biopsy technique, its indications, and the main information it can provide. The interest on bone biopsy should be renewed and nephrologists should be capacitated to perform it as part of their training during medical residency.",

MRI of the shoulder objectified infectious bursal disease. Its tuberculous origin was confirmed by the histological examination of ultrasound-guided synovial biopsy. The patient underwent TB treatment with good outcome. At 9-year follow-up, the patient had satisfactory articular function with no recurrence of infectious disease.",

        "Abstract":"BACKGROUND: The prognosis of IgA nephropathy (IgAN) is very heterogeneous. Predicting the nature and the rate of the disease progression is crucial for refining patient treatment. The aim of this study was to evaluate the prognostic impact of an Oxford classification-based repeat kidney tissue evaluation to predict end-stage renal disease (ESRD).\nMETHODS: Patients with biopsy-proven primary IgAN who underwent two renal biopsies at our centre were analyzed retrospectively. Renal biopsies were scored by two pathologists blinded to the clinical data and according to the updated Oxford classification. Cox models were generated to evaluate the prognostic impact considering the Oxford classification elementary lesions from the first (Model 1) or the second (Model 2) biopsy, adjusted on clinical data at time of reevaluation. The prognostic impacts of the dynamic evolution of each elementary lesion between biopsies were also assessed through univariate and multivariate evaluation.\nRESULTS: A total of 168 adult patients were included, with a median follow-up duration of 18 (range 11-24) years. The second biopsy was performed either systematically (n = 112) of for-cause (n = 56), after a median time of 5.4 years. The prognostic performances of Model 2 (second biopsy) were significantly better than Model 1 (first biopsy, analysis of deviance P < 0.0001). The dynamic changes of C and T lesions were significantly associated with the progression toward ESRD after adjustment on variables from Model 2.\nCONCLUSION: Both static and dynamic Oxford-based histological evaluation offered by a repeat biopsy improves the prediction of ESRD in patients with IgAN.",

        "Abstract":"RATIONALE & OBJECTIVES: Glomerular diseases, including minimal change disease, focal segmental glomerulosclerosis, membranous nephropathy, and immunoglobulin A (IgA) nephropathy, share clinical presentations, yet result from multiple biological mechanisms. Challenges to identifying underlying mechanisms, biomarkers, and new therapies include the rarity of each diagnosis and slow progression, often requiring decades to measure the effectiveness of interventions to prevent end-stage kidney disease (ESKD) or death.\nSTUDY DESIGN: Multicenter prospective cohort study.\nSETTING & PARTICIPANTS: Cure Glomerulonephropathy (CureGN) will enroll 2,400 children and adults with minimal change disease, focal segmental glomerulosclerosis, membranous nephropathy, or IgA nephropathy (including IgA vasculitis) and a first diagnostic kidney biopsy within 5 years. Patients with ESKD and those with secondary causes of glomerular disease are excluded.\nEXPOSURES: Clinical data, including medical history, medications, family history, and patient-reported outcomes, are obtained, along with a digital archive of kidney biopsy images and blood and urine specimens at study visits aligned with clinical care 1 to 4 times per year.\nOUTCOMES: Patients are followed up for changes in estimated glomerular filtration rate, disease activity, ESKD, and death and for nonrenal complications of disease and treatment, including infection, malignancy, cardiovascular, and thromboembolic events.\nANALYTICAL APPROACH: The study design supports multiple longitudinal analyses leveraging the diverse data domains of CureGN and its ancillary program. At 2,400 patients and an average of 2 years' initial follow-up, CureGN has 80% power to detect an HR of 1.4 to 1.9 for proteinuria remission and a mean difference of 2.1 to 3.0mL\/min\/1.73m in estimated glomerular filtration rate per year.\nLIMITATIONS: Current follow-up can only detect large differences in ESKD and death outcomes.\nCONCLUSIONS: Study infrastructure will support a broad range of scientific approaches to identify mechanistically distinct subgroups, identify accurate biomarkers of disease activity and progression, delineate disease-specific treatment targets, and inform future therapeutic trials. CureGN is expected to be among the largest prospective studies of children and adults with glomerular disease, with a broad goal to lessen disease burden and improve outcomes.",

        "Abstract":"Patients with chronic kidney disease (CKD) have an increased susceptibility to fracture and this risk gradually rises as renal disease progresses. Chronic Kidney Disease-Mineral and Bone Disorder (CKD- MBD) encompasses the mineral, bone, hormonal and calcific cardiovascular abnormalities that develop in these patients. Renal osteodystrophy (ROD) corresponds to the histopathologic description of bone lesions associated with CKD-MBD. Fragility fracture approach in CKD stages 1-3a may be similar to that of the general population. However, in stages 3b-5, osteoporosis cannot be established by the World Health Organization (WHO) criteria based on bone mineral density (BMD) or the presence of fragility fractures, because low BMD and fractures can also occur in the different forms of ROD. The gold standard for the diagnosis and classification of ROD is tetracycline double-labelled transiliac bone biopsy, with bone histology and histomorphometric analysis. By informing on bone turnover, mineralization and volume, it is a valuable tool that may help guide the management of CKD patients with fragility fractures, as therapeutic measures are distinct depending if the patient has osteoporosis or one of the forms of ROD. For patients with stages 1-3 CKD, without biochemical abnormalities suggestive of CKD-MBD, who sustained low-trauma fractures, any therapeutic approved for use in osteoporosis could be used. However, there is little evidence for the efficacy and safety of conventional anti-osteoporotic agents in patients with more advanced CKD stages, so currently the approach is opinion-based and must be patient-tailored depending on the presence or absence of ROD.",

        "Published":"2018-11-07",
        "Abstract":"Antiphospholipid antibody syndrome (APS) is an acquired prothrombotic autoimmune disease caused by the presence of antibodies against anionic phospholipids or plasma proteins bound to phospholipids on cell membranes. It can be a primary disease or secondary to other autoimmune diseases, most commonly systemic lupus erythematosus (SLE). Laboratory testing for antiphospholipid antibodies (aPL) may be only transiently positive, so APS could be missed until a catastrophic thrombotic episode or pregnancy morbidity occurs. In the kidneys, this manifests as thrombotic microangiopathy (TMA), and patients present with hypertensive urgency and acute kidney injury. However, APS may not always have a catastrophic presentation but instead a more smoldering course. Kidney biopsy may not show obvious active TMA lesions but rather only chronic injury in the form of zonal cortical scarring and tubular thyroidization. Still, it may warrant anticoagulation therapy. So it is important to recognize this pattern of injury in the biopsy. Herein, we retrospectively study the correlation between presence of this histologic feature in kidney biopsies of SLE patients and positive aPL testing results (anticardiolipin antibodies and\/or lupus anticoagulant). Kidney biopsies of SLE patients from 2004 to 2015 ( n = 186) were screened for presence or absence of zonal cortical scarring. Their electronic medical records were reviewed for aPL results. Our study showed low sensitivity (33%) but higher positive predictive value (62%), specificity (89%) and negative predictive value (71%). This histologic finding is therefore not a sensitive screening tool, but if present, greatly increases the likelihood of underlying aPL. We want to emphasize that recognition of this histologic feature in the biopsies of SLE patients is important so as not to miss the opportunity to treat with anticoagulation therapy and possibly slow down the chronic renal damage.",

        "Abstract":"OBJECTIVES: The clinical severity of IgA nephropathy (IgAN) at the time of biopsy diagnosis differs significantly among cases. One possible determinant of any such difference is the time taken for referral from the primary care physician to a nephrologist, but the definitive cause remains unclear. This study examined the contribution of the number of nephrologists per regional population as a potential social factor influencing the clinical severity at diagnosis among patients with IgAN in Japan, which has an ethnically homogeneous population.\nDESIGN: A cross-sectional study.\nSETTING AND PARTICIPANTS: Patients were registered in the Japan Renal Biopsy Registry (J-RBR), a nationwide multicentre registry, and 6426 patients diagnosed with IgAN were analysed. The facilities registered to the J-RBR were divided into 10 regions and the clinical features of IgAN at biopsy diagnosis, including renal function and level of proteinuria, were examined.\nMAIN OUTCOME MEASURES: Renal prognosis risk at the time of biopsy diagnosis defined by Kidney Disease Improving Global Outcomes guideline 2012.\nRESULTS: Among the regions, there were significant differences in the estimated glomerular filtration rate (67.5-91.4 mL\/min\/1.73 m), urinary protein excretion rate (0.93-1.93 g\/day) and renal prognosis risk group distribution at diagnosis. The severity of all clinical parameters was inversely correlated with the number of nephrologists per regional population, which showed an up to 2.7-fold difference among regions. A generalised linear mixed model revealed that a low number of nephrologists per regional population were significantly associated with fulfilment of clinical criteria indicating a very-high-risk renal prognosis (β=-0.484, 95% CI -0.959 to -0.010).\nCONCLUSIONS: Among Japanese patients with IgAN, significant regional differences were detected in clinical severity at the time of diagnosis. Social factors, such as an uneven distribution of nephrologists across regions, may influence the timing of biopsy and determine such differences.",

Histological classification was adapted from the World Health Organization recommendations. The indications for kidney biopsy were nephrotic syndrome in adults in 190 cases, rapidly progressive renal failure in 43, unexplained renal failure in 25, and steroid-resistant nephrotic syndrome in children in 12. The mean age of the patients was 31.48 ± 13.46 years. Male-to-female ratio was 1.87:1. Mean serum creatinine (SCr) of the patients was 2.36 ± 2.07 mg\/dL. Primary glomerulonephritis accounted for 88.89% of cases (240) while secondary glomerulonephritis accounted for 7.40% of total cases (20). Interstitial disease accounted for 1.5% and vascular disease for 2.2%. The most common lesion among primary glomerulonephritis was focal segmental glomerulosclerosis (FSGS) (31.11%) followed by diffuse proliferative glomerulonephritis (DPGN) (13.33%) and membranous glomerulonephritis (MGN) (12.59%). Among secondary glomerulonephritis, lupus nephritis was the most common (5.56%). In patients with SCr 1.4 mg\/dL or less (n = 131), FSGS was the most common histology (17.26%) followed by MGN (23.66%) and minimal change disease (7.63%). Whereas, in patients with SCr more than 1.4 mg\/dL (n = 139), DPGN was the most common diagnosis (23.74%) followed by FSGS (17.26%) and IgAN (12.23%). Fourteen patients (5.2%) had one or more episode of gross hematuria, three of whom required blood transfusion. The overall FSGS was the most common lesion seen. When we consider only patients with deranged renal function, DPGN was the most common histopathological lesion.

It included the recipients who underwent kidney transplantation between October 2014 and September 2015. The recipients were followed up postoperatively on an outpatient basis, as per the institution protocol. At 6 months posttransplantation, protocol graft biopsy was performed in all patients with normal functioning allograft without proteinuria after obtaining informed written consent.\nRESULTS: A total of 57 patients with chronic kidney disease underwent renal transplantation during the study period. Protocol biopsy was performed in 47 recipients. Subclinical rejection was found in 4 (8.5%) recipients. Two recipients had significant tubulitis and interstitial inflammation. One of them showed features of Banff Type IA cellular rejection (t2, i2) and another showed Banff Type IB cellular rejection (t3, i2).

Although the extent to which such mitochondrial changes contribute to human kidney disease is uncertain, experimental studies clearly demonstrate that mitochondrial damage can instigate pathogenetic processes that drive ongoing kidney disease. Clinical credence for this experimentally based hypothesis is provided by the development of kidney disease in patients with primary mitochondrial disorders. In this regard, substantial interest surrounds the occurrence of kidney disease in primary mitochondrial cytopathies, a heterogeneous group of conditions in which mutations in mitochondrial DNA (mtDNA) or nuclear DNA impair the functionality of components of the mitochondrial respiratory chain. We describe a novel mtDNA mutation in a patient who developed chronic kidney disease. The patient exhibited mitochondrial abnormalities in both muscle and kidney, chronic tubulointerstitial changes, and recurrent episodes of rhabdomyolysis. We outline mechanisms that may underlie the occurrence of chronic kidney disease in the setting of this novel mtDNA mutation. We also underscore the need to consider in relevant kidney diseases the presence of an underlying mitochondrial cytopathy because the latter more commonly exists than is generally recognized.",

        "Abstract":"BACKGROUND: Kidney biopsy is considered the gold standard for diagnosis of renal disease. It is increasingly performed in cases of diagnostic uncertainty, including in patients with coexistent diabetes and hypertension, for which a presumptive clinical diagnosis can be made. Little is known about the incidence and distribution of biopsy-proven kidney diseases. Changes in the distribution of biopsy diagnoses over time may have significant implications for resource allocation and future research.\nOBJECTIVE: We studied the relative frequency of kidney diseases in Southern Alberta over the past 30 years, to determine whether the population-standardized annual biopsy rate and incidence of selected diagnostic categories have changed. We hypothesized an increasing incidence of renal biopsies and a growing proportion of nonglomerular diseases (eg, tubulointerstitial disorders) likely due to evolving indications for biopsy. Given the rise in obesity, diabetes, and aging population with chronic kidney disease (CKD), we anticipated a rise in nephroangiosclerosis and diabetic nephropathy over time.\nDESIGN: Retrospective population-based cohort study using the Biobank for the Molecular Classification of Kidney Disease (BMCKD).\nSETTING: Southern Alberta, Canada.\nPATIENTS: All patients who underwent renal biopsy between 1985 and 2015 in our database.\nMEASUREMENTS: We used descriptive and quantitative analysis to characterize demographics and biopsy-based diagnoses.\nMETHODS: We conducted a retrospective population-based cohort study to analyze all consecutive patients who underwent at least one kidney biopsy over a 30-year period in Southern Alberta (1985-2015). We considered the first adequate biopsy. We described the annual standardized incidence of biopsy-proven kidney diseases over time and summarized associated patient characteristics. We assumed a Poisson distribution for biopsy counts and used provincial demographic information to standardize rates.\nRESULTS: During the study period, 6434 people (58% male; mean age: 47.9 years) underwent a kidney biopsy. The population-standardized annual biopsy rate increased from 10.8 biopsies per 100 000 person-years in the first 5 years of the study (1985-1989) to 18.2 biopsies per 100 000 person-years in the last 5 years (2010-2014). The mean age at the time of biopsy increased from 42.5 years (1985-1989) to 51.4 years (2010-2014). Glomerular diseases remained the most prevalent histopathological group, with a growing representation of diabetic kidney disease from 3.69% to 16.18%, and a relative decrease in the proportion of other glomerular diseases from 72.32% to 62.92% of glomerular diagnoses. Tubulointerstitial diseases increased from 5.87% to 7.36% of total diagnoses.\nLIMITATIONS: Classification schemes have changed over time, so recently recognized conditions may have been misclassified in earlier data. There was a changing group of pathologists and nephrologists over this period. Variations in interpretation and application of biopsy indications by physician may influence recorded prevalence of certain diagnoses. We do not yet have complete information on indications or patient outcomes linked to the database.\nCONCLUSIONS: In Southern Alberta, kidney biopsy is being utilized more frequently and in older people. Diabetic nephropathy is increasingly diagnosed, which may reflect either or both changes in the prevalence of causative factors and local biopsy practices.",

There is a recent concern regarding other histological findings that are not appreciated by using the turnover, mineralization, and volume (TMV) classification. Iron (Fe) overload has been considered a new challenge and the real significance of the presence of this metal in bones is not completely elucidated. Therefore, the main goal of the current study was to not only to identify bone Fe, but also correlate its presence with demographic, and biochemical characteristics.\nMETHODS: This is a cross-sectional analysis of bone biopsies performed in 604 patients on dialysis from 2010 to 2014 in a tertiary academic Hospital.\nRESULTS: Histomorphometric findings revealed the presence of Fe in 29.1%. Fe was associated with higher levels of serum ferritin and serum calcium. No TMV status was related to Fe bone overload.\nCONCLUSION: Our study has highlighted that the presence of Fe in one-third of bone samples has unknown clinical significance.

Glomerulosclerosis affected the estimated glomerular filtration rate at discharge and at 6 months; percentage of changed glomeruli predicted lower function at discharge and at 5 years. Glomerular thrombi in preimplant and postreperfusion biopsies predicted negative slope in estimated glomerular filtration rate from discharge to 6 months and a ≥ 25% drop in function after 6 months, respectively. Fibrinoid necrosis in glomeruli in preimplant biopsies predicted decline in function of ≥ 5 mL\/min\/1.73m² every year after 6 months. Chronic and total preimplant and posttransplant Banff scores predicted lower estimated glomerular filtration rate at discharge and at 6 months, with ≥ 25% drop in function after 6 months.\nCONCLUSIONS: Intraoperative biopsies are important in identifying patients at risk for worse graft function, especially concerning absence of gain of function early after transplant and loss of function late after transplant.",

Data comparing bone biopsy results and biomarkers of bone metabolism remain sparse.\nMETHODS: This is a single-center retrospective analysis of bone biopsy results (105) stratified by renal function, compared with intact parathyroid hormone (iPTH), bone-specific alkaline phosphatase (BAP) and other biomarkers. We tested associations with high-turnover ostitis fibrosa (OF) and mixed uremic osteodystrophy (MUO), i.e. classes I and III according to Delling's classification.\nRESULTS: 37% of patients had CKD stage 3-5 not on dialysis (CKD NOD) and 50% CKD stage 5 requiring haemodialysis (CKD 5D). iPTH was significantly higher in CKD 5D with high-turnover ROD, 26 (18) versus 8 (9) pmol\/l (p< 0.001). BAP showed no association. In CKD NOD, high-turnover ROD was associated with elevated iPTH, 32 (44) versus 8 (11) pmol\/l (p=0.001), and BAP, 39 (32) versus 16 (7) U\/l (p=0.01). iPTH achieved receiver operator characteristic (ROC) areas under the curve (AUC) of 0.83 (P=0.003) and 0.91 (P=0.019) for high-turnover ROD among CKD 5D and CKD NOD patients, respectively. An iPTH cutoff of 12.8 (CKD 5D) and 13.5 pmol\/l (CKD NOD) reached sensitivities and specificities of 0.83, 0.91 and 1.00, 0.91, respectively. In CKD NOD, BAP achieved an AUC of 0.93 (P=0.013) and with a cutoff at 19.8 U\/l a sensitivity and specificity of 1.00, 0.91, respectively.\nCONCLUSION: In CKD 5D patients, high-turnover ROD was associated with elevated iPTH at a low cutoff but not with BAP.

        "Published":"2018-07-26",
        "Abstract":"BACKGROUND: Providing the correct diagnosis for patients with tubulointerstitial kidney disease and secondary degenerative disorders, such as hypertension, remains a challenge. The autosomal dominant tubulointerstitial kidney disease (ADTKD) subtype caused by  mutations (ADTKD-) is particularly difficult to diagnose, because the mutational hotspot is a complex repeat domain, inaccessible with routine sequencing techniques. Here, we further evaluated SNaPshot minisequencing as a technique for diagnosing ADTKD- and assessed immunodetection of the disease-associated mucin 1 frameshift protein (MUC1-fs) as a nongenetic technique.\nMETHODS: We re-evaluated detection of  mutations by targeted repeat enrichment and SNaPshot minisequencing by haplotype reconstruction  microsatellite analysis in three independent ADTKD- families. Additionally, we generated rabbit polyclonal antibodies against MUC1-fs and evaluated immunodetection of wild-type and mutated allele products in human kidney biopsy specimens.\nRESULTS: The detection of  mutations by SNaPshot minisequencing was robust. Immunostaining with our MUC1-fs antibodies and an MUC1 antibody showed that both proteins are readily detectable in human ADTKD- kidneys, with mucin 1 localized to the apical membrane and MUC1-fs abundantly distributed throughout the cytoplasm. Notably, immunohistochemical analysis of MUC1-fs expression in clinical kidney samples facilitated reliable prediction of the disease status of individual patients.\nCONCLUSIONS: Diagnosing ADTKD- by molecular genetics is possible, but it is technically demanding and labor intensive. However, immunohistochemistry on kidney biopsy specimens is feasible for nongenetic diagnosis of ADTKD- and therefore, a valid method to select families for further diagnostics. Our data are compatible with the hypothesis that specific molecular effects of MUC1-fs underlie the pathogenesis of this disease.",

Although renal biopsy is an intervention to identify potential treatment-modifiable causes of disease, large-scale data studying the safety and outcomes of percutaneous native kidney biopsy in hospitalized patients are lacking.\nMETHODS: We queried the Nationwide Inpatient Sample database from 2008 to 2012 and identified all hospital admissions during which a percutaneous renal biopsy was performed. Patients <18 years of age or with a transplanted kidney were excluded. Data regarding associated renal pathology and procedure-related complications were collected and analyzed. Outcomes studied were length of stay, mortality and cost adjusted for inflation.\nRESULTS: A total of 118 064 hospital admissions were included in our analysis. The most common complications reported after percutaneous kidney biopsy were packed red blood cell transfusion (261\/1000 cases), hematuria (129\/1000 cases) and bleeding (78\/1000 cases). Patients had an overall mortality of 1.8%. The mean length of stay for each hospitalization was 10.65 days, with a significant difference between elective and nonelective admissions (6.3 versus 11.7; P < 0.01). The average cost per hospitalization was US$22 917 after adjusting for inflation, again with a significant difference between elective and nonelective admissions (15 168 versus 24 780; P < 0.01).\nCONCLUSION: Overall, percutaneous renal biopsy is considered a safe procedure; however, our study based on a national database demonstrates a relatively higher complication rate as compared with the limited prior available studies.",

        "Abstract":"BACKGROUND: Kidney transplantation is the best treatment for children with end-stage kidney disease. Early results have improved, but late graft loss is still a major problem. Non-invasive, fully reliable early biomarkers of acute rejection are currently missing.\nMETHODS: Our aim was to evaluate the efficacy of protocol biopsies (PBXs) in a pediatric population. During 11 years, 209 renal transplantations were performed in 204 pediatric patients. Biopsies were performed 3-6 months, 1 year, and 5 years after transplantation. Procedure-related complications were systematically looked for by means of ultrasound scans.\nRESULTS: Unexpected findings (mainly subclinical rejections) requiring therapeutic intervention were found in 19.3% biopsies performed at 3-6 months, in 18.4% in 12-month biopsies and in none of those performed after 5 years. The 13.6% patients at 12-month biopsies and 23.6% at 5-year biopsies showed calcineurin inhibitor (CNI) toxicity. Interstitial fibrosis and tubular atrophy (IF\/TA) was found in 17.6 and 83.6% of patients at 12-month and 5-year biopsies, respectively. Complications of the PBX were infrequent. Five-year estimated glomerular filtration rate (GFR) was not significantly different in patients who received treatment for any cause and patients with normal histology.\nCONCLUSIONS: Although we do not have a control group, we may speculate that patients who received treatment returned to a \"standard\" condition possibly improving final outcome. Protocol biopsies are a powerful diagnostic tool for the management of pediatric renal transplant recipients. In view of the lack of evidence that biopsies taken 5 years after transplantation lead to any therapeutic change, their use should be reconsidered.",

By contrast, the techniques used to analyze renal biopsy specimens have changed little over several decades. We tested the hypothesis that single-cell RNA-sequencing can comprehensively describe cell types and states in a human kidney biopsy specimen. We generated 8746 single-cell transcriptomes from a healthy adult kidney and a single kidney transplant biopsy core by single-cell RNA-sequencing. Unsupervised clustering analysis of the biopsy specimen was performed to identify 16 distinct cell types, including all of the major immune cell types and most native kidney cell types, in this biopsy specimen, for which the histologic read was mixed rejection. Monocytes formed two subclusters representing a nonclassical CD16+ group and a classic CD16- group expressing dendritic cell maturation markers. The presence of both monocyte cell subtypes was validated by staining of independent transplant biopsy specimens. Comparison of healthy kidney epithelial transcriptomes with biopsy specimen counterparts identified novel segment-specific proinflammatory responses in rejection. Endothelial cells formed three distinct subclusters: resting cells and two activated endothelial cell groups. One activated endothelial cell group expressed Fc receptor pathway activation and Ig internalization genes, consistent with the pathologic diagnosis of antibody-mediated rejection. We mapped previously defined genes that associate with rejection outcomes to single cell types and generated a searchable online gene expression database.

The ability to deliver genetic material to myofibroblast progenitors could allow new therapeutic approaches to treat kidney fibrosis. Preclinical and clinical studies show that adeno-associated viruses (AAVs) efficiently and safely transduce various tissue targets ; however, protocols for transduction of kidney mesenchymal cells have not been established.\nMETHODS: We evaluated the transduction profiles of various pseudotyped AAV vectors expressing either GFP or Cre recombinase reporters in mouse kidney and human kidney organoids.\nRESULTS: Of the six AAVs tested, a synthetic AAV called Anc80 showed specific and high-efficiency transduction of kidney stroma and mesangial cells. We characterized the cell specificity, dose dependence, and expression kinetics and showed the efficacy of this approach by knocking out Gli2 from kidney mesenchymal cells by injection of Anc80-Cre virus into either homozygous or heterozygous Gli2-floxed mice. After unilateral ureteral obstruction, the homozygous Gli2-floxed mice had less fibrosis than the Gli2 heterozygotes had. We observed the same antifibrotic effect in -catenin-floxed mice injected with Anc80-Cre virus before obstructive injury, strongly supporting a central role for canonical Wnt signaling in kidney myofibroblast activation. Finally, we showed that the Anc80 synthetic virus can transduce the mesenchymal lineage in human kidney organoids.\nCONCLUSIONS: These studies establish a novel method for inducible knockout of floxed genes in mouse mesangium, pericytes, and perivascular fibroblasts and are the foundation for future gene therapy approaches to treat kidney fibrosis.",

Genetic evaluation for ADTKD- specifically tests for a cytosine duplication that creates a unique frameshift protein (MUC1fs).

We used novel analytic methods to identify  frameshift mutations.\nRESULTS: After technique refinement, the sensitivity and specificity for MUC1fs immunostaining of urinary cell smears were 94.2% and 88.6%, respectively. Further genetic testing on 17 families with positive MUC1fs immunostaining revealed six families with five novel  frameshift mutations that all predict production of the identical MUC1fs protein.\nCONCLUSIONS: We developed a noninvasive immunohistochemical method to detect MUC1fs that, after further validation, may be useful in the future for diagnostic testing.

Data regarding the renal histopathology in these patients are scarce though the number of native kidney biopsies done in this subset of population is increasing. The present study is a retrospective analysis of 231 biopsies from a total of 700 biopsies, from patients above 60 years of age (M = 65.8%; F = 34.2%) with a mean age of 64 ± 6.03 years. The indications for kidney biopsy included nephrotic syndrome (NS) (30.4%), nephritic syndrome (19.1%), rapidly progressive renal failure (11.7%), acute kidney injury (AKI) (15.7%), and acute worsening of preexisting chronic kidney disease (CKD) (23%). The median percentage of glomerulosclerosis was 22% (5%-45%), and interstitial fibrosis and tubular atrophy was 30% (10%-50%). The most common cause for nephrotic syndrome was membranous nephropathy (31.4%) and for nephritic syndrome was benign arterionephrosclerosis (22.7%).

Approximately 60% of patients with a known genetic etiology of nephronophthisis are due to homozygous deletion of the NPHP1 gene. We identified a total of 45 renal biopsies from young patients with chronic kidney disease of undetermined etiology and analyzed them for the possibility of nephronophthisis due to NPHP1 deletion using interphase fluorescence in situ hybridization and\/or polymerase chain reaction. Homozygous NPHP1 deletion was identified in 9 patients (20%). In cases with adequate tissue, both assays were performed and showed 100% agreement. Blinded histopathologic analysis was then performed and identified 6 lesions that were significantly more common in biopsies from patients with NPHP1 deletion-proven nephronophthisis than chronic kidney injury of other known etiologies. Many of the classically described nephronophthisis biopsy lesions such as tubular basement membrane duplication, presence of cysts, and mononuclear interstitial inflammation were not significantly associated with this disease when compared with biopsies from patients with chronic kidney injury due to other etiologies. There were, however, morphologic lesions that were strongly associated with NPHP1 deletion including tubular abnormalities such as diverticulum, florets, and macula densa-like change as well as interstitial Tamm-Horsfall aggregates, periglomerular fibrosis, and the absence of arteriosclerosis.

Systemic involvement is much more common than occurrences isolated to a particular organ, and for this reason, it is imperative to rule out systemic involvement for osseous and nonosseous isolated neoplasms. These neoplasms present unique challenges due to their location, extent of involvement, vague presentation, and dearth of treatment protocol. We report the case of a 69-year-old man who developed chronic kidney disease stage 4 between 2009 and 2012. Precipitous kidney failure, anorexia, fatigue, and flank pain necessitated clinical follow-up that ultimately led to thorough imaging and bilateral kidney biopsy. Protein electrophoresis, immunohistochemistry, and immunofluorescence were all consistent with bilateral renal extramedullary plasmacytomas. Treatment recommendations are often limited to prior case successes; however, chemotherapy, radiation, and surgery are the mainstay of treatment. Although surgery or combined therapy provides the best results for patients, such options are unfeasible with bilateral kidney involvement. Therefore, a chemotherapy regimen, similar to that for multiple myeloma, was determined to be most reasonable. Treatment consisted of 4 cycles of a bortezomib, cyclophosphamide, and dexamethasone regimen. Three months following chemotherapy, kidney function returned to baseline levels.",

Mean baseline eGFR was 57.5±36.0 ml\/min per 1.73 m During follow-up (median, 34.3 months), 199 individuals suffered kidney disease progression. After adjustment for demographics, clinicopathologic diagnosis, and laboratory values, the following lesions (hazard ratio; 95% confidence interval) were independently associated with progression: inflammation in nonfibrosed interstitium (0.52; 0.32 to 0.83), moderate and severe versus minimal interstitial fibrosis\/tubular atrophy (2.14; 1.24 to 3.69 and 3.42; 1.99 to 5.87, respectively), moderate and severe versus minimal global glomerulosclerosis (2.17; 1.36 to 3.45 and 3.31; 2.04 to 5.38, respectively), moderate and severe versus minimal arterial sclerosis (1.78; 1.15 to 2.74 and 1.64; 1.04 to 2.60, respectively), and moderate and severe versus minimal arteriolar sclerosis (1.63; 1.08 to 2.46 and 2.33; 1.42 to 3.83, respectively). An 11-point chronicity score derived from semiquantitative assessments of chronic lesions independently associated with higher risk of kidney disease progression (hazard ratio per one-point increase, 1.19; 95% confidence interval, 1.12 to 1.27). Across a diverse group of kidney diseases, histopathologic lesions on kidney biopsy provide prognostic information, even after adjustment for proteinuria and eGFR.",

        "Abstract":"BACKGROUND: Up to 50% of lupus nephritis (LN) patients experience renal flares after their initial episode of LN. These flares contribute to poor renal outcomes. We postulated that intrarenal immune gene expression is different in flares compared with de novo LN, and conducted these studies to test this hypothesis.\nMETHODS: Glomerular and tubulointerstitial immune gene expression was evaluated in 14 patients who had a kidney biopsy to diagnose LN and another biopsy at their first LN flare. Ten healthy living kidney donors were included as controls. RNA was extracted from laser microdissected formalin-fixed paraffin-embedded kidney biopsies. Gene expression was analyzed using the Nanostring nCounter® platform and validated by quantitative real-time polymerase chain reaction. Differentially expressed genes were analyzed by the Ingenuity Pathway Analysis and Panther Gene Ontology tools.\nRESULTS: Over 110 genes were differentially expressed between LN and healthy control kidney biopsies. Although there was considerable molecular heterogeneity between LN biopsies at diagnosis and flare, for about half the LN patients gene expression from the first LN biopsy clustered with the repeated LN biopsy. However, in all patients, a set of eight interferon alpha-controlled genes had a significantly higher expression in the diagnostic biopsy compared with the flare biopsy. In contrast, nine tumor necrosis factor alpha-controlled genes had higher expression in flare biopsies.\nCONCLUSIONS: There is significant heterogeneity in immune-gene expression of kidney tissue from LN patients. There are limited but important differences in gene expression between LN flares, which may influence treatment decisions.",

        "Abstract":"BACKGROUND: Biopsy-based studies on nephrosclerosis are lacking and the clinicopathological predictors for progression of chronic kidney disease (CKD) are not well established.\nMETHODS: We retrospectively assessed 401 patients with biopsy-proven nephrosclerosis in Japan. Progression of CKD was defined as new-onset end-stage renal disease, decrease of estimated glomerular filtration rate (eGFR) by  ≥50% or doubling of serum creatinine, and the sub-distribution hazard ratio (SHR) with 95% confidence interval (CI) for CKD progression was determined for various clinical and histological characteristics in competing risks analysis. The incremental value of pathological information for predicting CKD progression was assessed by calculating Harrell's C-statistics, the Akaike information criterion (AIC), net reclassification improvement and integrated discrimination improvement.\nRESULTS: During a median follow-up period of 5.3 years, 117 patients showed progression of CKD and 10 patients died before the defined kidney event. Multivariable sub-distribution hazards model identified serum albumin (SHR 0.48; 95% CI 0.35-0.67), hemoglobin A1c (SHR 0.71; 95% CI 0.54-0.94), eGFR (SHR 0.98; 95% CI 0.97-0.99), urinary albumin\/creatinine ratio (UACR) (SHR 1.18; 95% CI 1.08-1.29), percentage of segmental\/global glomerulosclerosis (%GS) (SHR 1.01; 95% CI 1.00-1.02) and interstitial fibrosis and tubular atrophy (IFTA) (SHR 1.52; 95% CI 1.20-1.92) as risk factors for CKD progression. The C-statistic of a model with only clinical variables was improved by adding %GS (0.790 versus 0.796, P < 0.01) and IFTA (0.790 versus 0.811, P < 0.01). The reclassification statistic was also improved after adding the biopsy data to the clinical data. The model including IFTA was superior, with the lowest AIC.\nCONCLUSIONS: The study implies that in addition to the traditional markers of eGFR and UACR, we may explore the markers of serum albumin and hemoglobin A1c, which are widely available but not routinely measured in patients with nephrosclerosis, and the biopsy data, especially the data on the severity of interstitial damage, for the better prediction of CKD progression in patients with nephrosclerosis.",

        "Abstract":"Renal prognostic factors of chronic kidney disease are important concerns for patients. Kidney biopsy can be used to evaluate not only the activity of the original disease but also various risk factors related to the lifestyle of patients. Considering that lifestyle-related factors, including obesity and metabolic syndrome, are crucial prognostic risk factors of kidney disease progression and all-cause mortality, evaluation of lifestyle-related prognostic factors in kidney biopsy of all kidney diseases is important. Renal corpuscle size (glomerular size) is an easily measured parameter and potentially acts as a predictor of long-term renal function. Large renal corpuscle found on kidney biopsy is a classic and simple indicator, and has merit owing to its quantitative nature, but it has yet to be used to its full potential in clinical settings. Large renal corpuscle is an index that includes not only the activity of the original disease but also the damage of various metabolic risk states as represented by obesity, diabetes, and metabolic syndrome. Large renal corpuscles could be used to guide therapy. In this review, after identifying the pitfalls regarding the assessment of mean values in medical research, we propose that measurement of the maximum renal corpuscle profile (glomerular profile) in renal biopsies would provide valuable insights into the diagnosis, prognosis, and management of kidney diseases.",

        "Abstract":"INTRODUCTION: Renal transplantation became a routine and successful medical treatment for Chronic Kidney Disease in the last 30 years all over the world. Introduction of Luminex based Single Antigen Beads (SAB) and recent BANFF consensus of histopathological phenotypes of different forms of rejection enables more precise diagnosis and changes the therapeutic approach. The graft biopsies, protocol or cause, indicated, remain a golden diagnostic tool for clinical follow up of kidney transplant recipients (KTR).\nAIM: The study aimed to analyse the histopathological changes in renal grafts 12 months after the surgery in KTR with satisfactory kidney function.\nMATERIAL AND METHODS: A 12-month protocol biopsy study was performed in a cohort of 50 Kidney transplant recipients (42 from living and 8 from deceased donors). Usual work-up for suitable donors and recipients, standard surgical procedure, basic principles of peri and postoperative care and follow up were done in all KTR. Sequential quadruple immunosuppression including induction with Anti-thymocyte globulin (ATG) or Interleukin-2R antagonist (IL-2R), and triple drug maintenance therapy with Calcineurin Inhibitors (CNI), Mycophenolate Mofetil (MMF) and Steroids were prescribed to all pts. Different forms of Glomerulonephritis (16), Hypertension (10), End Stage Renal Disease (13), Hereditary Nephropathies (6), Diabetes (3) and Vesicoureteral Reflux (2) were the underlying diseases. All biopsies were performed under ultrasound guidance. The 16 gauge needles with automated \"gun\" were used to take 2 cores of tissue. The samples were stained with HE, PAS, Trichrome Masson and Silver and reviewed by the same pathologist. A revised and uploaded BANFF 2013 classification in 6 categories (Cat) was used.\nRESULTS: Out of 48 biopsies, 15 (31%) were considered as normal, 4 (8%), Borderline (BL-Cat 3), 5 (10%) as Interstitial Fibrosis\/Tubular Atrophy (IF\/TA-Cat 5), 5 (10%) were classified as non-immunological (Cat 6), 2 as a pure antibody-mediated rejection (ABMR-Cat 2) and T-cell Mediated Rejection (TCMR-Cat 4). The remaining 17 samples were classified as a \"mixed\" rejection: 7 (41%) ABMR + IF\/TA, 5 (29%) ABMR + BL + IF\/TA, 2 (11%) BL + IF\/TA, 1 (5%) ABMR + BL, 1 (5%) ABMR + TCMR and 1 (5%) TCMR + IF\/TA. The mean serum creatinine at the time of the biopsy was 126.7 ± 23.4 µmol\/L, while GFR-MDRD 63.4 ± 20.7 ml\/min, which means that the majority of the findings were subclinical. Among the non-immunological histological findings (Cat 6), 3 cases belonged to CNI toxicity, 1 to BK nephropathy and 1 to recurrence of the primary disease.\nCONCLUSION: Our 12-month protocol biopsy study revealed the presence of different forms of mixed subclinical rejection. Use of recent BANFF classification and scoring system enables more precise diagnosis and subsequently different approach to the further treatment of the KTR. More correlative long-term studies including Anti HLA antibodies and Endothelial Cell Activation- Associated Transcripts (ENDAT) are needed.",

We analyzed the incidence of recurrent GN and the factors associated with recurrence and graft and patient survivals.\nRESULTS: The types of GN were 95 IgA nephropathy, 47 focal segmental glomerulosclerosis, 14 membranous proliferative GN, 9 membranous GN, 8 lupus nephritis, 6 rapid progressive GN, and 4 Alport syndrome. The mean follow-up duration was 103 ± 81.7 months. Recurrence was reported in 36 patients, of which 20 grafts failed due to recurrence. The age of patients with GN recurrence was significantly younger than that of patients without GN recurrence (P = .030). The graft failure rate of KT recipients with recurrent GN was significantly higher than that of the recipients without recurrent GN (55.6% vs 18.4%, P < .001). In multivariate analysis, recurrence of primary GN, the number of HLA mismatches at AB, delayed graft function, and acute rejection were independent risk factors for graft failure.\nCONCLUSION: Recurrent GN remains a significant cause of graft loss in KT recipients. Surveillance of GN recurrence in the KT recipients with biopsy-proven GN can reduce allograft dysfunction.",

Patient attitudes on participating in kidney biopsy-based research are largely unknown.\nMETHODS: We evaluated attitudes toward donating kidney tissue to research among participants who had experienced a clinically indicated kidney biopsy, through a survey conducted 9 months (interquartile range, 5-13 months) after their biopsy.\nRESULTS: Of the 177 participants contacted, 117 (66%) participated in the survey. A total of 85 participants (73%) reported that they would allow additional needle passes during a clinically indicated biopsy to donate kidney tissue for research. As reasons for participating in such a study, the participants reported the desire to help others and to contribute to science, and the lack of additional burden while participating in such a study. In a multivariable logistic model, older and African American participants had lower odds of allowing an additional pass for research (odds ratio: age ≥65 years [vs. ≤40], 0.15 [95% confidence interval, 0.03-0.73]; African Americans (vs. all others), 0.15 [95% confidence interval, 0.05-0.44]). However, participants' self-reported biopsy complications such as pain, anxiety, and hematuria did not affect their willingness to allow additional passes. A total of 23 participants (20%) stated that they would agree to undergo a biopsy for research even if it was not clinically indicated.\nCONCLUSION: Among patients who had experienced a kidney biopsy, a majority were amenable to additional needle passes to donate kidney tissue for research during a future, clinically indicated biopsy, whereas a minority would undergo a biopsy for research purpose only.",

        "Abstract":"PURPOSE: Autosomal dominant polycystic kidney disease (ADPKD) is a common congenital chronic kidney disease (CKD). We report here the relationship of serum angiopoietin-1 (Ang-1), Ang-2, and vascular endothelial growth factor (VEGF) with total kidney volume (TKV), total cyst volume (TCV), and renal failure in adult ADPKD patients at various stages of CKD.\nMETHODS: This cross-sectional study was conducted with 50 patients diagnosed with ADPKD and a control group of 45 age-matched healthy volunteers. In patient group, TKV and TCV were determined with upper abdominal magnetic resonance imaging, whereas in controls, TKV was determined with ultrasonography according to ellipsoid formula. Renal function was assessed with serum creatinine, estimated glomerular filtration rate (eGFR), and spot urinary protein\/creatinine ratio (UPCR). Ang-1, Ang-2, and VEGF were measured using enzyme-linked immunosorbent assay.\nRESULTS: Patients with ADPKD had significantly higher TKV (p < 0.001) and UPCR (p < 0.001), and lower eGFR (p ≤ 0.001) compared to the controls. LogAng-2 was found to be higher in ADPKD patients at all CKD stages. Multiple linear regression analysis showed that there was no association between logAng-1, logAng-2, or logVEGF and creatinine, eGFR, UPCR, logTKV (p > 0.05).\nCONCLUSION: There was no association of serum angiogenic growth factors with TKV or renal failure in ADPKD patients. Increased serum Ang-2 observed in stages 1-2 CKD suggests that angiogenesis plays a role in the progression of early stage ADPKD, but not at later stages of the disease. This may be explained by possible cessation of angiogenesis in advanced stages of CKD due to the increased number of sclerotic glomeruli.",

Thus, we conducted a retrospective single center study comparing biopsy yield, adequacy, and rates of complications before and after utilization of a needle guide device.\nMETHODS: A retrospective analysis was performed on all native kidney biopsies performed before and after June 2015 corresponding to the start of needle guide use. All biopsies in the latter period of the study were performed by a single operator. We compared clinical characteristics, indications, type of investigation, tissue yield, adequacy of procedure, and rates of major and minor complications.\nRESULTS: A total of 343 biopsies were analyzed, 140 in the pre-needle guide use period (Period I) and 203 in the needle guide use period (Period II). Biopsy yields were similar, irrespective of the use of needle guides. Tissue adequacy was better in Period II (93.7% vs. 84%,  < 0.001, with respect to pathologist-reported inconclusive biopsies. There were no differences in terms of major complications (1.7%) for the two periods; however, the rate of minor complications (8.4%) was significantly reduced in Period II ( = 0.006). According to multiple logistic regression analysis, not using a needle guide (odds ratio, 3.70;  < 0.001) along with low hemoglobin level, higher pre-dialysis serum creatinine level, and high urinary red blood cell count were significant predictors of biopsy complications.\nCONCLUSION: Use of a needle guide improves biopsy adequacy and is associated with reduced rates of minor complications in native renal biopsies. Therefore, needle guides may be recommended in percutaneous renal biopsies, especially when transitioning to single-operator performed procedures.",

On multivariate analysis, patients with myocarditis who underwent EMB had higher in-hospital mortality (hazard ratio [HR] 1.97, 95% confidence interval [CI] 1.41-2.74) and longer median hospital stay (9 days vs 3 days; P < .001). EMB was associated with a higher incidence of cardiac tamponade (odds ratio [OR] 5.21, 95% CI 2.76-9.82), cardiogenic shock (OR 4.66, 95% CI 3.75-5.78), need for intra-aortic balloon pump (OR 3.52, 95% CI 2.49-4.97), and need for extracorporeal membrane oxygenation (OR 4.26, 95% CI 2.78-6.53).\nCONCLUSIONS: The use of EMB in hospitalizations with myocarditis has decreased over time. The use of EMB was associated with a higher likelihood of in-hospital mortality and morbidity. Whether these findings represent a causative association from the procedure or a consequence of more severe disease in this group could not be confirmed in this study.",

        "Abstract":"PURPOSE OF REVIEW: The purpose of this review is to provide evidence to justify the use of bone biopsy data to guide decisions regarding fracture prevention in patients with chronic kidney disease (CKD). To date, no data can support the use of bone biopsy for this purpose. However, we believe that bone turnover, mineralization and volume (TMV) data might help decide, which therapy to use.\nRECENT FINDINGS: Previous bone biopsy-based prospective and intervention studies have used bone turnover as an outcome measure. Recent data have shown that bone volume (trabecular and cortical) and mineralization should also be evaluated. Moreover, crystal quality and osteocytic protein expression can be analyzed using bone fragments. Noninvasive analysis of bone volume and bone turnover markers can be performed during patient follow-up.\nSUMMARY: Only bone biopsy can provide information on the TMV parameters. Case reports and retrospective studies suggest that bone histomorphometric analysis can guide better therapeutic decisions to prevent fractures in patients with CKD. However, prospective data are still lacking.",

        "Abstract":"OBJECTIVES: We investigated the incidence of gastrointestinal disorders requiring endoscopic and histopathologic diagnoses in renal transplant recipients.\nMATERIALS AND METHODS: In this retrospective analysis, we examined records of patients seen at the Department of Hepato-Gastroenterology and Transplantation Sciences, Sindh Institute of Urology and Trans?lantation (Karachi, Pakistan) from January 2010 to December 2014. Renal transplant recipients with gastrointestinal disorders who required endoscopy, including proctoscopy and upper and lower gastrointestinal endoscopy as per indication, were included.\nRESULTS: Of 1770 patients included in this study, most were male patients (n = 1517; 85.7%). In this patient group, 1957 endoscopies, including proctoscopies, were performed, which included 1033 esophagogastroduodenoscopies (52.8%), 571 sigmoidoscopies (29.2%), and 107 colonoscopies (5.5%). The most common indications were diarrhea (n = 697; 31.2%) and weight loss (n = 690; 31%). Findings showed esophageal candidiasis in 127 patients (12%); however, biopsy revealed Candida species in 33 patients (34%). Cytomegalovirus and herpes esophagitis were observed in 8 (8.3%) and 5 patients (5.2%). Helicobacter pylori gastritis was seen in 119 patients (15.4%), cytomegalovirus gastritis in 9 patients (1.2%), and gastric lymphoma in 1 patient (0.1%). Duodenal fissuring was the most common pathology observed during endoscopy (396 patients; 33.9%), followed by decreased height of duodenal folds in 157 patients (13.4%), with biopsy showing sprue in 325 patients (37.6%) and giardiasis in 118 patients (13.7%). Lower gastrointestinal endoscopy showed ulcers in 198 patients (24.6%) and polyps in 31 patients (3.9%). Histopathologic examination showed cytomegalovirus colitis in 89 patients (15.5%), amebic colitis in 21 (3.7%), and tuberculosis in 11 (1.9%).\nCONCLUSIONS: We observed a wide spectrum of pathologic lesions, including opportunistic infections, in endoscopic biopsies from our renal transplant patients. Cytomegalovirus colitis was the most common infection in the lower gastrointestinal tract, whereas giardiasis was the most common in the duodenum.",

However, the overall situation regarding common glomerular diseases in China remains unclear. Hence, the aim of this study was to assess the national profile of the common types of glomerulonephritis in China.\nMETHODS: We searched Medline, Embase, Cochrane Library, CNKI, SinoMed, VIP, and Wanfang databases for English and Chinese language articles from inception to September 2017. We also collected potentially relevant studies and reviews using a manual search. The following words in combinations are as keywords: \"renal biopsy\", \"kidney pathological diagnosis\", and \"spectrum of pathological types\".\nRESULTS: We identified 23 studies involving 176,355 patients from 15 provinces\/cities in China. The detection rates of primary glomerulonephritis (PGN) and secondary glomerulonephritis (SGN) were 0.740 and 0.221, respectively. Over the past 30 years, the top five types of PGN were immunoglobulin A nephropathy (IgAN; 24.3%), mesangial proliferative glomerulonephritis (MsPGN; 10.5%), membranous nephropathy (MN; 12.6%), minimal change disease (MCD; 9.8%), and focal segmental glomerulosclerosis (FSGS; 4.6%), and the top four types of SGN were lupus nephritis (LN; 8.6%), Henoch-Schönlein purpura glomerulonephritis (4.1%), hepatitis B virus-associated glomerulonephritis (HBV-GN; 2.6%), and diabetic nephropathy (DN; 1.6%). The proportion of MN, MCD, HBV-GN, and DN tended to increase, while those of IgAN, MsPGN, FSGS, and LN tended to drop.\nCONCLUSIONS: Although the incidence of SGN is increasing gradually, PGN is still the leading form of kidney disease in patients undergoing renal biopsies in China. IgAN and LN are the most common types of PGN and SGN, respectively. Differences between regions are related to various factors such as nationality, environment, and diet. Furthermore, unified standards and norms for evaluating renal biopsies are urgently needed.",

        "Abstract":"As the life expectancy is increasing, there is a rise in elderly population and consequent increase in the patients with renal disease. There is an inconsistency between clinical and histopathological diagnosis in elderly, and so renal biopsy is important in these patients to decide appropriate clinical management and prognosis. This study outlines the importance of renal biopsy in elderly and describes the clinical and pathologic spectrum of renal diseases in patient ≥60 years. All patients (age ≥60 years) undergoing renal biopsies from January 2011 to December 2014 were included in this retrospective study. The clinical presentation and biochemical findings were recorded, and the patients were grouped based on their clinical presentation. Renal biopsies were also evaluated. The mean age of patients was 67.7 ± 6.4 years with a male:female ratio of 3:1. The most common clinical manifestation was nephrotic syndrome (37.4%) followed by rapidly progressive renal failure (RPRF) (20.6%). Amyloidosis and membranous nephropathy were two most common diagnoses in patients with nephrotic presentation whereas pauci-immune crescentic glomerulonephritis and cast nephropathy were common in patients presenting with RPRF. Clinical diagnosis differed from the histopathological diagnosis in 32% cases of nephrotic syndrome. There was good agreement between clinical diagnosis and histology in cases with RPRF. In 73% cases of elderly with (Type II) diabetes suspected of having nondiabetic renal disease clinically, renal biopsy showed evidence of diabetic nephropathy. Renal biopsy is essential in the diagnosis of renal diseases even in elderly. Amyloidosis and membranous nephropathy are common causes of nephrotic syndrome in elderly. Renal biopsy is very useful in diagnosing cast nephropathy and amyloidosis as they are not suspected clinically. It is also helpful in elderly diabetics without retinopathy to differentiate between diabetic and nondiabetic kidney diseases.",

Studies report about 3% of fractures in CKD patients, and these occur earlier than in the general population, namely 16 and 13 years earlier for men and women, respectively. Better understanding of the pathophysiology of fractures would probably contribute to new therapeutic approaches. This study aimed to evaluate report of long bone fractures from a bone biopsies bank from patients on hemodialysis and compare clinical and biochemical characteristics, as well as the results of the histomorphometric analysis of trabecular and cortical bone of these patients with a control group (without fractures), paired for age, gender, and time on hemodialysis. Bone proteins (SOST, DMP1 and MEPE) were evaluated by immunohistochemistry. Seventeen patients with fracture and controls were studied. Fracture prevalence was 0.82\/1000 patients\/year. Serum phosphorus levels were significantly lower in the fracture group. Histomorphometric analysis revealed that all the patients had high turnover disease, and the fracture group had smaller volume and trabecular thickness, greater osteoid surface, smaller eroded surface, smaller mineralizing surface, formation rate and longer mineralization lag time when compared to controls; the DMP1 expression in the cortical bone was smaller and the SOST in the trabecular bone was higher in fractured patients. As conclusion, we found low prevalence of fractures. Both groups had high turnover disease, but the fractured ones presented more impaired bone microarchitecture, as well as lower formation and greater mineralization defect.

Today, biopsy specimens are read using a combination of light microscopy, electron microscopy, and indirect immunofluorescence, with a limited number of antibodies. These techniques all were perfected decades ago with only incremental changes since then. By contrast, recent advances in single-cell genomics are transforming scientists' ability to characterize cells. Rather than measure the expression of several genes at a time by immunofluorescence, it now is possible to measure the expression of thousands of genes in thousands of single cells simultaneously. Here, we argue that the development of single-cell RNA sequencing offers an opportunity to describe human kidney disease comprehensively at a cellular level. It is particularly well suited for the analysis of immune cells, which are characterized by multiple subtypes and changing functions depending on their environment. In this review, we summarize the development of single-cell RNA sequencing methodologies. We discuss how these approaches are being applied in other organs, and the potential for this powerful technology to transform our understanding of kidney disease once applied to the renal biopsy.",

Here, we defined the incidence of renal sarcoidosis among renal biopsy cases and analyzed the clinical course.  We performed an epidemiological study examining renal biopsy cases treated at 5 centers between January 2000 and September 2015 and identified 16 cases (7 men, 9 women; mean (±SD) age, 59.4±18.6 years) out of a total of 14191 renal biopsy cases. Renal involvement of sarcoidosis was defined as granulomatous tubulointerstitial nephritis, tubulointerstitial nephritis without granulomatous lesions, and renal calcinosis. Fifteen of the cases were treated with steroid therapy. One case initially received steroid pulse therapy. The outcome was evaluated based on the estimated glomerular filtration rate (eGFR), CKD stage, and the change in eGFR (ΔeGFR) after treatment. A favorable response was defined as ΔeGFR ≥25%.  The incidence of renal sarcoidosis was 0.11%. The mean eGFR was 28.2±16.1 mL\/min\/1.73 m. At the last observation, the mean eGFR was 43.7±19.7 mL\/min\/1.73 m. Although a favorable response to steroid therapy was found in the majority of cases (10\/15, 67%), 12 of the 15 cases (80%) had residual renal dysfunction at the last observation and 8 cases (53%) had moderate to severe renal dysfunction.  Renal sarcoidosis is extremely rare among renal biopsy cases. Among cases with an unfavorable response to steroid therapy, pathogenetic mechanisms other than sarcoidosis and severe nephron damage were observed. .",

CD147\/basigin is involved in the pathogenesis of acute kidney injury and renal fibrosis through inflammatory cell infiltration. The present study examined the clinical relevance of CD147 in biopsy-proven kidney diseases that lead to the progression of chronic kidney disease.\nMETHODS: Kidney biopsy specimens and plasma and urine samples were obtained from patients with kidney diseases, including IgA nephropathy (IgAN), Henoch-Schönlein purpura nephritis (HSPN), diabetic kidney disease (DKD), focal segmental glomerulosclerosis (FSGS), and membranous nephropathy (MN), who underwent renal biopsy between 2011 and 2014. Plasma and urinary CD147 levels were measured and evaluated for their ability to reflect histological features. Disease activity of IgAN tissues was evaluated according to the Oxford classification and the Japanese histological grading system.\nRESULTS: In biopsy tissues, CD147 induction was detected in injured lesions representing renal inflammation. Plasma CD147 values correlated with eGFR in patients with inflammation-related kidney diseases such as IgAN, HSPN, and DKD. Particularly in IgAN patients, plasma CD147 levels were correlated with injured regions comprising more than 50% of glomeruli or with tubular atrophy\/interstitial injury in biopsy tissues. Proteinuria showed a closer correlation with urinary values of CD147 and L-FABP. Of note, plasma and urinary CD147 levels showed a strong correlation with eGFR or proteinuria, respectively, only in DKD patients.\nCONCLUSION: Evaluation of plasma and urinary CD147 levels might provide key insights for the understanding of the activity of various kidney diseases.",

We present a case in which a patient initially presented at age 41 years with nephrotic-range proteinuria and hypertension; a kidney biopsy showed FGN. The patient was treated with angiotensin receptor blockage only, without immunosuppression as per patient preference, and the level of protein in the urine improved. During the follow-up period of 17 years, the patient developed type 2 diabetes mellitus. The patient re-presented with nephrotic-range proteinuria 17 years later, at the age of 58 years. A kidney biopsy was performed and showed diffuse diabetic glomerulosclerosis with secondary focal segmental glomerulosclerosis and related vascular changes. There was no evidence of FGN by immunofluorescence or electron microscopy. Although FGN has been rarely reported to regress clinically, this is the first documented case of histologic regression of FGN. The potential for FGN fibrils to regress spontaneously is important in the management of FGN patients considering that currently available immunosuppressive agents have limited efficacy, and is an encouraging finding for future studies aiming to find a cure for the disease.",

A hallmark of CKD progression is renal fibrosis characterized by excessive accumulation of extracellular matrix (ECM) proteins. In this study, we aimed to investigate the correlation of the urinary proteome classifier CKD273 and individual urinary peptides with the degree of fibrosis. In total, 42 kidney biopsies and urine samples were examined. The percentage of fibrosis per total tissue area was assessed in Masson trichrome stained kidney tissues. The urinary proteome was analysed by capillary electrophoresis coupled to mass spectrometry. CKD273 displayed a significant and positive correlation with the degree of fibrosis (Rho = 0.430, P = 0.0044), while the routinely used parameters (glomerular filtration rate, urine albumin-to-creatinine ratio and urine protein-to-creatinine ratio) did not (Rho = -0.222; -0.137; -0.070 and P = 0.16; 0.39; 0.66, respectively). We identified seven fibrosis-associated peptides displaying a significant and negative correlation with the degree of fibrosis. All peptides were collagen fragments, suggesting that these may be causally related to the observed accumulation of ECM in the kidneys. CKD273 and specific peptides are significantly associated with kidney fibrosis; such an association could not be detected by other biomarkers for CKD.

It is the only technique allowing a dynamic evaluation of osteoblast activity after labelling with tetracycline.

Bone samples are taken at iliac crest level under local anesthesia and sedation. Samples are put into methyl-metacrilate resin where the sections are prepared for the microscopic analysis of different histomorphometric parameters. Histomorphometry is used to exclude or confirm the diagnosis of osteomalacia and also to evaluate bone damage associated with particular treatments (for example, glucocorticoids, anticonvulsants) or in case of rare bone diseases (osteogenesis imperfecta). Recently, this approach has been repurposed for the evaluation of bone disease during Chronic Kidney Disease, particularly to differentiate high and low bone turnover osteodystrophy.

Rare variants in COL4A5 on chromosome Xq22 cause X-linked Alport syndrome, which accounts for ∼80% of the cases. Alport syndrome has a variable clinical presentation, including progressive kidney failure, hearing loss, and ocular defects. Exome sequencing performed in 2 affected related males with an undefined X-linked glomerulopathy characterized by global and segmental glomerulosclerosis, mesangial hypercellularity, and vague basement membrane immune complex deposition revealed a COL4A5 sequence variant, a substitution of a thymine by a guanine at nucleotide 665 (c.T665G; rs281874761) of the coding DNA predicted to lead to a cysteine to phenylalanine substitution at amino acid 222, which was not seen in databases cataloguing natural human genetic variation, including dbSNP138, 1000 Genomes Project release version 01-11-2004, Exome Sequencing Project 21-06-2014, or ExAC 01-11-2014. Review of the literature identified 2 additional families with the same COL4A5 variant leading to similar atypical histopathologic features, suggesting a unique pathologic mechanism initiated by this specific rare variant. Homology modeling suggests that the substitution alters the structural and dynamic properties of the type IV collagen trimer. Genetic analysis comparing members of the 3 families indicated a distant relationship with a shared haplotype, implying a founder effect.",

Kidney impairment remains an important early and late post-transplantation complication. Although numerous histopathological changes have been reported, the pathophysiology remains incompletely understood. Furthermore, correlations between clinical findings and morphological changes have not been well studied. Between 2000 and 2016, 17 recipients of allogeneic (n = 12) or autologous (n = 5) HCT underwent kidney biopsy for either proteinuria or deterioration of kidney function at our center. The most common biopsy findings were therapy-related changes with thrombotic microangiopathy (n = 5), calcineurin inhibitor toxicity (n = 4), and membranous glomerulonephritis (n = 3), representing the majority of cases in this category. In addition, kidney findings from 137 autopsies performed between 1995 and March 2017 were analyzed. The most common changes were acute kidney injury (n = 55), most likely due to the patients' premortal deteriorated state, and thrombotic microangiopathy (n = 14). Several cases demonstrated involvement by either infectious agents (n = 6) or tumors (n = 9). Distinct kidney diseases, such as glomerulonephritis, were rare (3% of cases). Uncommon and yet rarely described diagnoses for this patient cohort were IgG4-related tubulointerstitial nephritis and fibrillary nephritis. This study provides a comprehensive overview of the histomorphological findings in kidney biopsy specimens from HCT recipients. Along with treatment-related complications, one putative correlate of chronic GVHD of the kidney could be documented: membranous glomerulonephritis.

        "Abstract":"Focal segmental glomerulosclerosis (FSGS) is a pathological lesion rather than a disease, with a diverse etiology. FSGS may result from genetic and non‑genetic factors. FSGS is considered a podocyte disease due to the fact that in the majority of patients with proven‑FSGS, the lesion results from defects in the podocyte structure or function. However, FSGS does not result exclusively from podocyte‑associated genes, however also from other genes including collagen IV‑associated genes. Patients who carry the collagen type IVA3 chain (COL4A3) or COL4A4 mutations usually exhibit Alport Syndrome (AS), thin basement membrane neuropathy or familial hematuria (FH). Previous studies revealed that long‑time persistent microscopic hematuria may lead to FSGS. A case of a family is presented here where affected individuals exhibited FH with FSGS‑proven, or chronic kidney disease. Renal biopsies were unhelpful and failed to demonstrate glomerular or basement membrane defects consistent with an inherited glomerulopathy, and therefore a possible underlying genetic cause for a unifying diagnosis was pursued. Genomic DNA of the siblings affected by FH with biopsy‑proven FSGS was analyzed, and their father was screened for 18 gene mutations associated with FSGS [nephrin, podocin, CD2 associated protein, phospholipase C ε, actinin α 4, transient receptor potential cation channel subfamily C member 6, inverted formin, FH2 and WH2 domain containing, Wilms tumor 1, LIM homeobox transcription factor 1 β, laminin subunit β 2, laminin subunit β 3, galactosida α, integrin subunit β 4, scavenger receptor class B member 2, coenzyme Q2, decaprenyl diphosphate synthase subunit 2, mitochondrially encoded tRNA leucine 1 (UUA\/G; TRNL1) and SWI\/SNF related, matrix associated, actin dependent regulator of chromatin, subfamily a like 1] using matrix‑assisted laser desorption\/ionization time‑of‑flight mass spectrometry technology. Then whole exome sequencing (WES) was performed in the two probands to ascertain whether there were other known or unknown gene mutations that segregated with the disease. Using mass array technology, a TRNL1 missense homozygous mutation (m. 3290T>C) was identified in the probands diagnosed with FH and manifested as FSGS on biopsy. In addition, a COL4A4 missense mutation c. 4195A>T (p. M1399L) in heterozygous pattern was identified using WES. None of these variants were detected in their father. In the present study, a mutation in TRNL1 (m. 3290T>C) was identified, which was the first reported variant associated with FSGS. The COL4A4 (c. 4195A>T) may co‑segregate with FSGS. Screening for COL4A mutations in familial FSGS patients is suggested in the present study. Genetic investigations of families with similar clinical phenotypes should be a priority for nephrologists. The combination of mass array technology and WES may improve the detection rate of genetic mutation with a high level of accuracy.",

        "Abstract":"BACKGROUND: Nephrosclerosis is an increasingly reason for dialysis in Japan. However, kidney biopsy specimens for hypertensive nephrosclerosis are very limited; thus, the pathologic evaluation of hypertensive nephrosclerosis currently remains unclear.\nMETHODS: Clinical and pathologic data of a total of 184 biopsy-confirmed hypertensive nephrosclerosis patients were collected from 13 centers throughout Japan. Seven pathological findings were assessed in this study. The outcomes of interest for this study were dialysis, composite kidney events, cardiovascular events, and all-cause mortality.\nRESULTS: The Green and Yellow (G&Y), Orange, and Red groups of the chronic kidney diseases (CKD) heat map contained 36, 57, and 91 cases, respectively. The mean observation period was 7.3 ± 5.2 (median, IQR; 6.1, 2.6-9.7) years. Global glomerulosclerosis (GScle), interstitial fibrosis and tubular atrophy (IFTA), arteriolar hyalinosis in Red exhibited higher scores than those in G&Y and Orange. The incidence rates of the composite kidney end points in 100 person-years for the G&Y, Orange, and Red groups were 1.42, 2.16, and 3.98, respectively. In the univariate Cox analysis for the composite kidney end points, GScle, IFTA and interstitial cell infiltration exhibited statistically significant high hazard ratios (1.18, 1.84, 1.69, respectively). However, after adjustment for clinical and medication data, the Red group in the CKD heat map category was risk factor for the composite kidney end points (HR 9.51).\nCONCLUSIONS: In summary, although pathologic findings had minor impacts on the prediction of composite outcomes in this study, the clinical stage of the CKD heat map is a good predictor of composite kidney events.",

        "Abstract":"Diabetes mellitus (DM) is a worldwide health problem due to its high prevalence, incidence and impact on patient morbidity and mortality. Chronic kidney disease (CKD) is one of the most important complications of DM. The indication of renal biopsy in diabetic patients is a widely debated topic and the final decision is usually individualized. The results of renal biopsy in diabetic patients can be classified into three groups: diabetic nephropathy (DN), non-diabetic renal disease (NDRD) or DN plus NDRD (mixed forms). Renal involvement in DN has been widely studied and different pathological classifications have been proposed. Some groups demonstrated a relationship between the pathological classifications in DN and renal prognosis. However, to our knowledge renal biopsy in diabetic patients with DN has not demonstrated an impact on their survival and renal prognosis. Some recent studies suggest that non-proteinuric diabetic patients may be affected of DN. In addition, kidney biopsy in DN under new treatments may have a fundamental role in assessing renal protection or even regression of diabetic histological lesions. On the other hand, the accurate and early diagnosis and subsequent treatment of diabetic patients with NDRD has been shown to benefit both their renal and patient prognosis. Renal involvement in patients with DM is very heterogeneous. Thus, the role of renal biopsy in diabetic patients is becoming increasingly important.",

        "Published":"2016-11-03",
        "Abstract":"INTRODUCTION: We investigated local resistance patterns to guide antibiotic use for the prevention of infections associated with transrectal prostate biopsy with ultrasound guidance.\nMETHODS: Per the AUA (American Urological Association) recommendations (2014 and 2016) for transrectal prostate biopsy with ultrasound guidance prophylaxis, local antibiogram resistance was reviewed. Rates of Escherichia coli fluoroquinolone resistance were between 20% and 28%. Thus, the antibiotics chosen were a single dose of oral ciprofloxacin and intramuscular ceftriaxone at least 30 minutes before transrectal prostate biopsy with ultrasound guidance. Data were reviewed retrospectively between July 2012 and December 2015. There was no standard prophylaxis before protocol implementation in August 2014. Univariable analyses were performed with appropriate testing followed by multivariable logistic regression.\nRESULTS: Of 2,351 biopsies 799 were performed in patients in the protocol group. Before protocol implementation 26 different antibiotic regimens were used. The protocol group had significantly more cases of chronic kidney disease, a history of cancer, larger prostate volume and greater number of cores during transrectal prostate biopsy with ultrasound guidance. The overall hospital admission rate after transrectal prostate biopsy with ultrasound guidance was 1.35% for the nonprotocol group and 0.4% for the protocol group (p = 0.026). The incidence of organisms with antimicrobial resistance in blood and urine decreased from 20.7% (23 cases) in the nonprotocol group and 7.1% (4) in the protocol group (p=0.030). All positive blood cultures occurred in the nonprotocol group and all were ciprofloxacin resistant . On multivariable logistic regression those patients requiring hospitalization were 12.9 (95% CI 2.81-58.96) times more likely to have resistant organisms cultured (p=0.001).\nCONCLUSIONS: The transrectal prostate biopsy with ultrasound guidance antibiotic prophylaxis protocol decreased unwanted variation among practitioners, which is ultimately associated withimproved quality. Antibiogram directed prophylaxis where there is high fluoroquinolone resistance maintains low infection and hospital admission rates after transrectal prostate biopsy with ultrasound guidance.",

The most common granulomatous disease of the thyroid is subacute granulomatous thyroiditis, which is presumed to have a viral or post-viral inflammatory cause. Bacterial etiologies include tuberculosis, actinomycosis, and nocardiosis, but are extremely rare. Disseminated actinomycosis and nocardiosis more commonly affect organ-transplant patients with the highest susceptibility within the first year after transplant surgery.\nCASE: A 45-year-old African American male, who received his third kidney transplant for renal failure secondary to Alport Syndrome, presented with numerous subcutaneous nodules and diffuse muscle pain in the neck. Further workup revealed bilateral nodularity of the thyroid. Fine needle aspiration of these nodules demonstrated suppurative granulomatous thyroiditis. Subsequent right thyroid lobectomy showed granulomatous thyroiditis with filamentous micro-organisms, morphologically resembling Nocardia or Actinomyces.\nCONCLUSION: Disseminated granulomatous disease presenting in the thyroid is very rare, and typically afflicts immune-compromised patients. The overall clinical, cytologic and histologic picture of this patient strongly points to an infectious etiology, likely Nocardia, in the setting of recent organ transplantation within the last year.",

Serum creatinine was 1.4 (0.8-1.7) mg\/dL in the last year before hemodialysis initiation. Initial hemodialysis access was a dialysis catheter in all 13 patients. AKI precipitating SORO-ESRD followed acute rejection (4), postoperative (2), tubulo-interstitial nephritis (2), unknown (2), infection\/sepsis (1), contrast nephropathy (1), BKV nephropathy (1), and cardio-renal syndrome (1). Renal allograft survival was 1469 (277-4939) days (4 years). Renal allograft biopsies were available in 9\/14 (69%) RTRs - Four showed acute rejection, two of which followed interruption of immunosuppression, three revealed acute tubular necrosis and four others also showed chronic transplant glomerulopathy. Time on hemodialysis was 856 (129-1630) days (2.4 years). 5\/13 RTRs with SORO-ESRD (38%) died - 3 (60%) following cardiac arrest, 2 (40%) after stopping hemodialysis. 4\/13 (31%) were re-transplanted in the period of this study.\nCONCLUSION: SORO-ESRD contributed significantly to late renal allograft loss and return to hemodialysis with 100% initial dialysis catheter rate. Potentially preventable causes of AKI leading to SORO-ESRD were identified. The application of experience gained from such studies would help reduce late renal allograft loss and the need for re-transplantation. This would further help reduce the yawning gap between need and availability of donor kidney organs both here in the United States and around the world. Larger studies are warranted.",

We hypothesized that molecular changes associated with less-than-expected hyalinosis might highlight a subpopulation of patients with under-immunosuppression\/nonadherence at intermediate times of biopsy posttransplant (TxBx). Using gene expression data from 562 indication biopsies, we developed a molecular classifier for predicting the expected ah lesions (M ) at a particular TxBx. M -scores increased linearly with log(TxBx), but some biopsies had lower scores than expected for TxBx. The deviation of individual M -scores below the predicted regression line of M -scores vs TxBx is defined as \"low hyalinosis index.\" Low hyalinosis indices were frequent in biopsies between 3 months and 3 years posttransplant, particularly among biopsies lacking histologic hyalinosis (ah0), and were associated with T cell-mediated rejection and a subset of recent-onset antibody-mediated rejection without glomerular double contours. In patients with medical records available for review, low hyalinosis indices were frequently associated with physician-recorded concerns about nonadherence (suspected or proven). We conclude that the M classifier and hyalinosis index identify indication biopsies with rejection for which the possibility of patient nonadherence should be considered.",

In the Middle East, half of all patients reaching end-stage are categorised as either unknown etiology or hypertension-related nephropathy.\nOBJECTIVES: To report a renal biopsy series, in a reproducible format and manner, so that data can be compared directly among other series.\nPATIENTS AND METHODS: Biopsies of native kidneys were performed in a 10-year period, at a tertiary referral hospital that provides the entire nephrology service for north Cyprus. Data are reported from 153 patients older than 17 years, who were either Turkish-Cypriot or from the Turkish mainland.\nRESULTS: Mean biopsy rate was 48 per million population (pmp) per year. Mean age was 45.7 years (range 18-78). Overall, the sex distribution was similar (male 51%). The most common histopathological categories were primary glomerulonephritis (GN) (56%), secondary GN (27%), and tubulo-interstitial disease (14%). Of those with primary GN, 29% had secondary (2o) focal and segmental glomerulosclerosis (FSGS) (29%), followed by IgA nephropathy (24 %), membranous 18% and a further 11 patients with 1o FSGS (12%). The incidence of IgA nephropathy was 6.3 per pmp\/year. When expressed as a percentage of the annual biopsy rate, 14% of all biopsies showed IgA nephropathy.\nCONCLUSIONS: To compare data among centres, they must be expressed in terms of the population (incidence pmp\/year) and the biopsy rate. In our population, secondary FSGS is common and uncharacterised and we believe many will be caused by monogenic disease.",

Circulating parathyroid hormone (PTH) and total alkaline phosphatase levels do not always reflect bone turnover in CKD-MBD, whereas bone biopsy provides precise information regarding bone pathology. Given the lack of specificity of several biomarkers and noninvasive tools regarding ROD, bone biopsy is required for precise diagnosis and for the determination of therapeutic strategies. In clinical practice, bone biopsy is not performed due to lack of enthusiasm among nephrologists for several reasons including the invasiveness of the procedure, the potential pain, and lack of technical training.

        "Abstract":"BACKGROUND: Bleeding is a recognized complication of native percutaneous renal biopsy. This study aimed to describe the incidence of major bleeding after biopsy in a single centre over a 15-year period and examine factors associated with major bleeding.\nMETHODS: We identified consecutive adult patients undergoing ultrasound-guided native renal biopsy in the Glasgow Renal and Transplant Unit from 2000 to 2014. From the electronic patient record, we collected data pertaining to biopsy indication, pre- and post-biopsy laboratory measurements, prescribed medication and diagnosis. Aspirin was routinely continued. We defined major bleeding post-biopsy as the need for blood transfusion, surgical or radiological intervention or death. Binary logistic regression analysis was used to assess factors associated with increased risk of major bleeding.\nRESULTS: There were 2563 patients who underwent native renal biopsy (1499 elective, 1064 emergency). The average age of patients was 57 (SD 17) years and 57.4% were male. Overall, the rate of major bleeding was 2.2%. In all, 46 patients required transfusion (1.8%), 9 patients underwent embolization (0.4%), no patient required nephrectomy and 1 patient died as a result of a significant late retroperitoneal bleed. Major bleeding was more common in those undergoing emergency compared with elective renal biopsy (3.4 versus 1.1%; P < 0.001). Aspirin was being taken at the time of biopsy in 327 of 1509 patients, with no significant increase in the risk of major bleeding (P = 0.93). Body mass index (BMI) data were available for 546 patients, with no increased risk of major bleeding in 207 patients classified as obese (BMI >30).\nCONCLUSIONS: The risk of major bleeding following native renal biopsy in the modern era is low. Complications are more common when biopsy is conducted as an emergency, which has implications for obtaining informed consent. Our data support the strategy of not stopping aspirin before renal biopsy.",

The clinical characteristics and histological diagnosis pertaining to each case, distribution of renal diseases in children with various clinical presentations, and changes in the pattern of kidney disease during the study period were analyzed.\nRESULTS: A total of 1740 paediatric kidney biopsies were performed during the study period. The mean age was 12.8 ± 4.9 years (8 months to 18 years) and the male: female ratio was 1.5:1. The most common indication for renal biopsy was nephrotic syndrome (63.2%) followed by acute nephritic syndrome (13%). Minimal change disease was the most common cause of nephrotic syndrome while endocapillary proliferative glomerulonephritis (65.7% infection related), remained the commonest cause of acute nephritic syndrome. IgA nephropathy was the commonest cause of chronic kidney disease. Contrary to trends in European paediatric cohorts, the frequency of lupus nephritis increased over the two decades of the study, while that of endocapillary proliferative glomerulonephritis did not show any appreciable decline.\nCONCLUSION: This study provides the largest data on biopsy proven renal disease in children from South Asia published till date and highlights important differences in the spectrum and trends of kidney disease compared to data from other regions.",

        "Abstract":"Patients with chronic kidney disease (CKD) are at increased risk of fractures. The fracture risk steadily increases along with the progression of renal disease to become several-fold higher in end-stage renal disease (ESRD) patients as compared to age and sex-matched controls. Renal osteodystrophy (ROD) is a heterogeneous group of metabolic bone diseases complicating progressive chronic kidney disease. Bone biomarkers and bone imaging techniques may help to assess bone health and predict fractures in CKD, but do have important inherent limitations. The gold standard for the diagnosis and specific classification of renal osteodystrophy (ROD) remains the (quantitative) histomorphometric analysis of the bone biopsy. By informing on bone turnover and mineralization, a bone biopsy may help guide prevention and treatment of ROD and its consequences. This review aims to present an update on epidemiological and procedural aspects, clinical indications, and histomorphometric analysis of bone biopsies and to define the role of bone biopsy in current CKD-MBD care.",

        "Abstract":"Purpose Clinically, repeat renal biopsies (RRBs) have been performed in lupus nephritis to identify changes in class, plan treatment and assist in prognostication. We set out to compare the histopathological features and outcomes of disease flare and protocol biopsy patients. Methods A retrospective descriptive study was conducted on repeat biopsies performed between January 1984 and December 2015 in lupus nephritis patients. Disease flares and protocol biopsies were compared. Results Of 614 systemic lupus erythematosus (SLE) renal biopsies, 127 (20.7%) RRBs were identified. Disease flare patients accounted for 96 (75.6%) and protocol biopsies for 31 (24.4%) of RRBs. Seventy (72.9%) disease flare patients retained their original class on repeat biopsy. When categorised as proliferative and non-proliferative histology, 83 (87.4%) of the disease flare biopsy patients remained histologically unchanged. Treatment remained unchanged in 57 (60.0%) patients following RRBs for disease flares. Response to immunosuppression in disease flare patients was poorer. Non-response was associated with increased chronicity index (OR = 1.33; 95% CI 1.01-1.76; p = 0.045). Thirty-three (36.3%) disease flare patients developed end-stage kidney disease (ESKD) in one year as compared to one (3.6%) protocol biopsy patient ( p = 0.003). ESKD in disease flare patients was associated with non-response to treatment (OR = 24.6; 95% CI 2.7-219.3; p = 0.004) on multivariate analysis. One-year mortality was 30.0% in the disease flare patients and 3.5% in protocol biopsy patients ( p = 0.018). Conclusion Repeat biopsies in disease flare patients infrequently led to histological class changes, failed to lead to change of treatment in the majority of patients, and were associated with poorer outcomes.",

Twenty-nine (64%) had stable graft function and 16 (36%) had impaired graft function at the time of dnDSA detection. Even in the group with stable graft function, we found a high rate of rejection (53%) on biopsy. Eighty-eight percent of patients with impaired graft function had rejection. Those patients with impaired graft function had significantly lower estimated glomerular filtration rate at 12 months postbiopsy and at last follow-up. Those with impaired graft function had more graft failures; however, this result was not statistically significant.

Limited information is available regarding the changing spectrum of secondary glomerular diseases (SGDs). To further investigate changes in the spectrum of SGDs, we performed a cross-sectional study.\nMETHODS: From June 2010 to May 2015, 5,935 patients from 37 hospitals in Shandong Province were involved in this study. The study was divided into five periods according to 1-year intervals. The patients were divided into four age groups.\nRESULTS: Of the 5,935 patients with qualified specimens, 1,038 (17.5%) were diagnosed with a SGD. Lupus nephritis (LN) (27.6%) was the most frequently identified SGD, followed by Henoch-Schönlein purpura glomerulonephritis (HSPN) (21.7%) and diabetic nephropathy (DN) (21.6%). The prevalence rate of DN demonstrated an increasing trend, and this condition became the leading cause of renal biopsy in period 3 (29.3%). The proportion of patients with hepatitis B virus-associated nephritis (HBVAN) decreased from 14.7% in period 2 to 5.1% in period 5 (p < 0.001). The proportion of patients with amyloidosis nephropathy (AN) increased from 2.2% in period 1 to 7.0% in period 5 (p = 0.088). The prevalence rate of DN was 0.6% in pediatric patients and 40.7% in elderly patients (p < 0.001).\nCONCLUSIONS: In our study, SGD was the second leading cause of renal biopsy. The distribution of the spectrum of SGD varied with time and age. Given the possibility of a detection bias, larger prospective cohort studies are needed in the future..",

PNH can sometimes present directly with renal manifestations, without showing any hematological manifestation. It, therefore, becomes essential for clinicians and pathologists to be aware of the spectrum of renal changes in PNH. The aim of this study was to document the morphologic changes observed in renal biopsies in patients with PNH. This is an observational study. We report three cases that presented with acute or chronic renal insufficiency and were suspected as PNH on viewing their renal biopsy in light of their clinical and laboratory details. All the three cases were confirmed as PNH on the basis of flow cytometric analysis of CD55 and CD59. Renal biopsy in these patients showed a variety of morphologic changes, however the most consistent finding was moderate-to-heavy siderosis in their kidneys. PNH  may be difficult to diagnose clinically and sometimes present directly with renal manifestations. It is, therefore, prudent for nephrologists and nephropathologists to be aware of the spectrum of renal changes in PNH.",

        "Abstract":"BACKGROUND: Pulmonary mucormycosis is a rare opportunistic infection with high mortality that is caused by species of Mucorales. The most common species involved are Rhizopus, Mucor, Lichtheimia, and Rhizomucor.\nCASE REPORT: A 56 year-old woman presented with a clinical history of diabetes mellitus type 2 and chronic renal disease. She underwent a cadaveric kidney transplantation two years before her admission, for which immunomodulating therapy with thymoglobulin, tacrolimus, mofetil-microphenolate and prednisone was established. The patient suffered a pneumonic process with cough, expectoration, and dyspnoea. The computed tomography scan showed a cavitation in the right upper lobe. With all these findings an invasive broncopulmonary aspergillosis was suspected and the patient began an antifungal treatment with voriconazole without improvement. Rhizomucor pusillus was isolated from a clinical specimen obtained by fine needle aspiration, and its identification was confirmed by PCR. After this finding amphotericin B was administered, but the patient had an uncontrolled haemoptysis and died.\nCONCLUSIONS: Pulmonary mucormycosis is a rare infection, usually fatal in kidney transplant recipients with anti-rejection therapy. Mucorales species usually produce thrombotic phenomena, associated with necrosis and parenchymal destruction that caused a fatal uncontrolled haemoptysis in our patient. Early diagnosis is important in order to perform any surgical treatment and to administer amphotericin B.",

Despite an increased knowledge of pathophysiological processes involved in kidney diseases, the progress in defining novel treatment strategies has been limited. One reason is the descriptive disease categorization used in nephrology based on clinical findings or histopathological categories irrespective of potential different molecular disease mechanisms. To accelerate progress toward a targeted treatment, a definition of human disease extending from phenotypic disease classification to mechanism-based disease definitions is needed. In recent years, we have witnessed a major transition in biomedical research from a single gene research to an information rich and collaborative science. Tissue-based analysis in renal disease allows to link structure to molecular function. In our review, we introduce the concept of precision medicine in nephrology, describe several large cohort studies established for molecular analysis of kidney diseases, and highlight examples of renal biopsy-driven target identification by integrative systems biology approaches. Furthermore, we give an outlook on how the new disease definitions can be used for patient stratification in clinical trial design.

To determine whether other vitamin K antagonists (VKA) cause WRN, we retrospectively collected and analyzed the clinical and histological data of 13 patients treated with different VKA (seven with fluindione, four with warfarin and two with acenocoumarol) in seven French hospitals.  They all developed gross hematuria following overanticoagulation complicated by severe AKI (median serum creatinine concentration = 693 μmol\/L). Histological analysis of the kidney biopsies highlighted the presence of intratubular RBCC and acute tubular necrosis in all patients and of an underlying kidney disease in 12 patients. WRN was suspected in patients treated with warfarin; however, the initial diagnosis was incorrect in six of the nine patients treated with other VKA. Nine patients progressed to chronic kidney disease, one fully recovered renal function, two died and one still needs dialysis.  This is the first report of AKI caused by fluindione. In agreement with the recent publication on AKI in two patients treated with dabigatran, we suggest that the term 'anticoagulant-related nephropathy' is more appropriate than WRN.

The patients consisted of 9 males and 3 females, with an average age of 73.8 years (range, 44 to 100 years). The underlying diseases were variable, including diseases affecting the general condition (multiple organ failure, chronic heart and renal insufficiency, pemphigoid, etc) and conditions with increased risk of aspiration (sequelae of cerebrovascular disease, Alzheimer's disease, advanced stage of nasopharyngeal carcinoma, paralytic ileus, etc). The 12 cases were all caused by Inhalation of mineral oil. Common symptoms included cough, sputum production and dyspnea. ELP had no special physical signs. Inflammation indexes, such as white blood cell, neutrophil percentage, ESR, C reactive protein, procalcitonin, D-Dimer, and blood lipid levels were usually normal. Radiological features of ELP mainly included consolidation, mass or nodules, with a little ground-glass opacity. Some patients had ventilation and\/or diffusion dysfunction. The diagnostic methods included CT-guided percutaneous lung biopsy, thoracoscopy, thoracotomy or autopsy. Histopathological findings showed accumulation of large foamy macrophages in the alveolar spaces, with a few lipid deposition and polykaryocytes. The main treatment of ELP was cessation of lipid material contact. One case died of ELP, 6 died of other coexisting diseases, and the rest 6 improved with treatment and were discharged. The survival patients were all stable during a follow-up of 2-4.5 years.  ELP was rare and its clinical manifestation was atypical. Its radiological manifestations were indistinguishable from pneumonia, lung cancer, interstitial lung diseases, etc. Pathological examination was the gold standard for diagnosis, and the preferred means of sampling was bronchoscopy.

        "Abstract":"Progressive fibrosis of the interstitium is the dominant final pathway in renal destruction in native and transplanted kidneys. Over time, the continuum of molecular events following immunological and nonimmunological insults lead to interstitial fibrosis and tubular atrophy and culminate in kidney failure. We hypothesize that these insults trigger changes in DNA methylation (DNAm) patterns, which in turn could exacerbate injury and slow down the regeneration processes, leading to fibrosis development and graft dysfunction. Herein, we analyzed biopsy samples from kidney allografts collected 24 months posttransplantation and used an integrative multi-omics approach to understand the underlying molecular mechanisms. The role of DNAm and microRNAs on the graft gene expression was evaluated. Enrichment analyses of differentially methylated CpG sites were performed using GenomeRunner. CpGs were strongly enriched in regions that were variably methylated among tissues, implying high tissue specificity in their regulatory impact. Corresponding to this methylation pattern, gene expression data were related to immune response (activated state) and nephrogenesis (inhibited state). Preimplantation biopsies showed similar DNAm patterns to normal allograft biopsies at 2 years posttransplantation. Our findings demonstrate for the first time a relationship among epigenetic modifications and development of interstitial fibrosis, graft function, and inter-individual variation on long-term outcomes.",

        "Abstract":"INTRODUCTION: Little is known about the prevalence of kidney diseases according to renal biopsy in Israel. Since updated literature worldwide emphasizes changing etiologies of chronic kidney disease, it is crucial to research and define the epidemiology and pathology of kidney disease in Israel. Hereby, we introduce an original review of the prevalence of kidney diseases in our study population, which we believe reflects the prevalence of kidney diseases in the population of Israel.\nAIMS: To investigate the prevalence of kidney diseases diagnosed by renal biopsy, according to age, gender, race and clinical symptoms.\nMETHODS: A total of 155 kidney biopsies were conducted in the years 2000-2014 in Bnai-Zion Medical Center in Haifa, according to formal accepted indications. Most of the biopsies (65%) were needle aspirations in a retroperitoneal approach, in which 90% were ultrasound guided and the rest computed tomography guided, while the other 35% of biopsies involved laparoscopic approaches.\nRESULTS: The most common indications for kidney biopsy were nephrotic syndrome, nephritic syndrome and proteinuria (37.4%, 25.8% and 24.5%, respectively). Average glomeruli number per biopsy was 17.5 vs. 82.2 for needle aspiration and laparoscopic approach, respectively (statistically significant). The most common diagnosis was focal segmental glomerulosclerosis (FSGS), followed by chronic glomerulonephritis, IgA nephropathy, lupus nephritis, minimal change disease (MCD), membranous nephropathy and tubulointerstitial disease (20%, 11.5%, 11.5%, 10.1%, 9.5%, 8.1% and 6.1%, respectively).\nCONCLUSIONS: FSGS was the most common diagnosis in patients presented with nephrotic syndrome or proteinuria, men, and patients above 60 years of age. Patients below 30 years of age were mainly diagnosed with IgA nephropathy.\nDISCUSSION: In recent years, FSGS is becoming more prevalent compared with other chronic kidney disease especially in the older population. IgA nephropathy is still the most common diagnosis in young patients and in patients presented with hematuria.

        "Abstract":"The authors conducted a prospective trial to assess the feasibility of real time central molecular assessment of kidney transplant biopsy samples from 10 North American or European centers. Biopsy samples taken 1 day to 34 years posttransplantation were stabilized in RNAlater, sent via courier overnight at ambient temperature to the central laboratory, and processed (29 h workflow) using microarrays to assess T cell- and antibody-mediated rejection (TCMR and ABMR, respectively). Of 538 biopsy samples submitted, 519 (96%) were sufficient for microarray analysis (average length, 3 mm). Automated reports were generated without knowledge of histology and HLA antibody, with diagnoses assigned based on Molecular Microscope Diagnostic System (MMDx) classifier algorithms and signed out by one observer. Agreement between MMDx and histology (balanced accuracy) was 77% for TCMR, 77% for ABMR, and 76% for no rejection. A classification tree derived to provide automated sign-outs predicted the observer sign-outs with >90% accuracy. In 451 biopsy samples where feedback was obtained, clinicians indicated that MMDx more frequently agreed with clinical judgment (87%) than did histology (80%) (p = 0.0042). In 81% of feedback forms, clinicians reported that MMDx increased confidence in management compared with conventional assessment alone. The authors conclude that real time central molecular assessment is feasible and offers a useful new dimension in biopsy interpretation. ClinicalTrials.gov NCT#01299168.",

        "Abstract":"Bone biopsy is currently the only means to accurately assess renal osteodystrophy and responses to therapeutic interventions. With sedation, the technique is relatively painless, and complications are uncommon. Bone biopsy should be considered when the aetiology of symptoms or biochemical abnormalities is in question, and results may lead to changes in therapy. Although it remains prudent to use antiresorptive drugs cautiously in patients with chronic kidney disease (CKD) stages 3a-4 and low bone mineral density, bone biopsy may not be warranted before commencing therapy in these patients. Histomorphometric indices adopted for bone biopsy assessment are turnover (T), mineralisation (M) and volume (V). Often, only measurements of trabecular bone are reported; however, marked cortical changes are common in CKD and may be critical to bone structure and integrity. MicroCT of bone biopsies can rapidly assess static parameters and provides information on the cortical and trabecular compartments that may influence management. Limitations of bone biopsy include the time required for pre-biopsy tetracycline labelling and sample processing, and a paucity of facilities to process and report samples. Patients with CKD may not respond predictably to treatments, and because the biopsy sample is illustrative of activity at only one skeletal site and one point in time, assessment of real-time laboratory trends is always required. Optimally, we need a non-invasive 'virtual bone biopsy' that provides information for initiating and monitoring therapy. However, bone biopsy is the current standard by which the accuracy of investigational imaging techniques, hormonal values and biochemical turnover markers are judged.",

Changes in bone structure lead to impaired bone quality, compromised bone strength and increased susceptibility to fractures with associated significant morbidity, mortality and financial cost. Diagnosis and management of ROD is hindered by the inadequacy of currently available diagnostic methods to interpret the complex pathophysiology. Bone biopsy, the perceived gold standard test to assess ROD, is invasive and suboptimal for disease screening and management in routine clinical practice. High-resolution imaging, such as high-resolution peripheral quantitative computed tomography and high-resolution magnetic resonance imaging provide accurate non-invasive quantification of bone microarchitecture and facilitate assessment of mechanical competence of bone, correlating with skeletal fragility. We discuss the potential for these imaging techniques in patients with CKD to provide quantification and assessment of bone structure and strength.

This study assessed the relative accuracy of the two equations in assessing eGFR in patients aged 18 years with chronic kidney disease. A total of 3042 patients (1679 males and 1363 females), aged 2-20 years, who were registered in the Japan Renal Biopsy Registry or the Japan Kidney Disease Registry between 2007 and 2013 were evaluated. eGFR values derived from formulas for children (Uemura's formula) and adults (the 3-variable Japanese formula) were calculated and compared, especially in patients aged 18 years. At all ages, but especially at younger ages, eGFR was significantly higher when calculated with the adult than the paediatric formula. This finding was also observed in 18-year-old adolescents with eGFR <90 mL\/min per 1.73 m (P = 0.026). However, the mean difference between the two calculated eGFRs was only 2.79 mL\/min per 1.73 m . These findings indicate that both creatinine-based equations used to calculate eGFR rate in Japanese children and adults with chronic kidney disease could be used to determine eGFR in 18-year-old subjects, with the difference between the two within permissible levels for clinical use.",

This study was conducted to evaluate the outcome for LN patients and factors that correlate with their outcome. Materials and methods We included 80 patients with proved LN and more than three-years follow up at Shiraz University of Medical Sciences. We prepared a data gathering sheet for each patient and extracted the data from patients' file records which existed in the hospital. Results The mean age of patients was 36.6 ± 10.6 years, and 88.3% of patients were women. Men develop remission less than women (three men (33.3%) vs 49 women (72.1%), p = 0.014). Chronic kidney disease (GFR < 60) developed in 14.2% of our patients, and 7.8% progressed to end stage renal disease (ESRD). We found a significant relation between initial creatinine (Cr), GFR, and urine 24 hour protein with developing ESRD ( p = 0.002, 0.039, < 0.001, respectively). Also we found that hypertensive patients are at risk of developing ESRD 0.4 times more than normotensive patients ( p = 0.047, CI: 0.131-0.985). Lack of remission was significantly associated with ESRD progression ( p = 0.025). Conclusion There is a strong agreement among studies that initial Cr, hypertension and lack of remission are associated with poor outcome in LN patients. As a result we must observe hypertensive patients and patients with increased Cr more carefully. Also, we should consider changing treatment in patients who do not develop remission. In spite of dominancy of women in SLE, men are likely to have poorer outcomes.",

Factors associated with major complications were derived from univariate analysis and then modelled by stepwise multivariate logistic regression. Based on the odds ratio, independent predictors were assigned a weighted integer. The risk score is calculated from the sum of the integers.\nRESULTS: The overall incidence of major complications was 3.2%. Independent factors associated with MC were lower pre-biopsy haemoglobin, lower platelets, higher blood urea nitrogen, documented chronic kidney disease features in pre-biopsy ultrasound (US) and the presence of haematoma in the post-biopsy US. A score for pre-biopsy evaluation included the first four predictors and stratified patients in three categories with increasing risk at higher scores (low-risk 0.1%, moderate-risk 3.0% and high-risk 26.1%). The score demonstrated good discriminative power (AUC = 0.872). The addition of post-biopsy US findings increased the discriminative power (AUC = 0.938). A higher post-biopsy risk score was also associated with a higher incidence of MC (low-risk 0.2%, moderate-risk 2.7%, high-risk 16.9%).\nCONCLUSION: The risk of major complications after a percutaneous renal biopsy can be assessed by a simple risk score calculated from readily available information.",

        "Published":"2017-04-13",
        "Abstract":"BACKGROUND: Patients with an impaired renal function show a high incidence of bone and mineral disturbances. These 'chronic kidney disease - mineral and bone disorders' (CKD-MBD) range from high turnover osteoporosis to adynamic bone disease. Currently, the histomorphometric analysis of a bone biopsy taken from the iliac crest is viewed as the gold standard for CKD-MBD subtype differentiation. However, the clinical relevance of such a biopsy is questionable since iliac crest fractures are an extremely rare finding. Therefore, we aimed to elucidate if the histomorphometric parameter 'trabecular bone volume (BV\/TV)' from the iliac crest is representative for other biopsy locations. We chose two skeletal sites of higher fracture risk for testing, namely, the tibial bone and the lumbar spine, to examine if the current gold standard of bone biopsy is indeed golden.\nMETHODS: Bone biopsies were taken from 12 embalmed body donors at the iliac crest, the proximal tibia, and the lumbar vertebral body, respectively. Masson-Goldner stained sections of methyl methacrylate embedded biopsies were used for trabecular bone volume calculation. Furthermore, exemplary μ-computed tomography (XtremeCT) scans with subsequent analysis were performed.\nRESULTS: Median values of trabecular bone volume were comparable between all body donors with median (interquartile range, IQR) 18.3% (10.9-22.9%) at the iliac crest, 21.5% (9.5-40.1%) at the proximal tibia, and 16.3% (11.4-25.0%) at the lumbar spine. However, single values showed extensive intra-individual variation, which were also confirmed by XtremeCT imaging.\nCONCLUSIONS: Distinct intra-individual heterogeneity of trabecular bone volume elucidate why a bone biopsy from one site does not necessarily predict patient relevant endpoints like hip or spine fractures. Physicians interpreting bone biopsy results should know this limitation of the current gold standard for CKD-MBD diagnostic, especially, when systemic therapeutic decisions should be based on it.",

It gives vital information which helps in estimating the disease prognosis, progression, and management. This is the retrospective analysis of all adult patients aged above 18 years, who underwent percutaneous renal biopsy at The Kidney Center Post Graduate Training Institute, Karachi, over a duration of 18 years, i.e., January 1, 1996, to December 2013. Renal graft biopsies and those which were inadequate were excluded from analysis. Of the1962 biopsies performed, we included 1521 biopsies in our assessment. The mean age of the population was 38 ± 15.26 years (range 18-88 years). There were 920 (60.5%) males and 601 (39.5%) females. The most common clinical indication of kidney biopsy was nephrotic syndrome, i.e., 741 (45.7%), followed by chronic kidney disease, 253 (16.6%); acute renal failure, 184; (12.1%) and rapidly progressive glomerulonephritis (GN), 124 (8.2%). Primary GN was found in the majority of the patients, 984 (64.7%), followed by secondary GN in 249 (16.4%), tubulointerstitial disease in 224 (14.7%), and vascular disease in 64 (4.2%). In primary GN, focal segmental glomerulosclerosis was the most common histopathological diagnosis in 297 (19.5%) patients, followed by MGN in 224 (14.7%), chronic GN in 98 (6.4%), crescentic GN in 93 (6.1%), minimal change disease in 87 (5.7%), membranoproliferative glomerulonephritis in 58 (3.8%), and postinfection glomerulonephritis in 53 (3.5%) patients. This study shows that focal segmental glomerulosclerosis is the most common lesion in renal biopsy in the young age group followed by membranous nephropathy. Diabetic nephropathy and chronic interstitial nephritis were dominant secondary pathological lesions in older age group, whereas lupus nephritis was the most common secondary disease in young age females.",

        "Abstract":"Cystinosis is the most common cause of inherited renal Fanconi syndrome in young children, and typically presents with laboratory findings of a proximal tubulopathy and corneal crystals by one year of age. We describe here renal biopsy findings in a 20-month-old patient with an atypical presentation of distal renal tubular acidosis, diabetes insipidus, and the absence of corneal crystals. Although renal biopsy is usually not necessary to establish the diagnosis of cystinosis, when the patient presents with atypical signs and symptoms, a renal biopsy may be extremely valuable. A 20-month-old boy presented with failure to thrive, polyuria, polydipsia, and rickets. He initially showed evidence of a renal tubular acidosis, mild renal insufficiency, and nephrogenic diabetes insipidus. His initial ophthalmologic examination did not demonstrate corneal crystals. His subsequent workup revealed phosphaturia, suggesting a partial proximal tubulopathy. Concomitantly, a renal biopsy revealed prominent podocytes with an immature glomerular appearance, and electron microscopy analysis showed numerous intracellular crystals within tubular epithelial cells. Subsequent laboratory and genetic testing confirmed a diagnosis of infantile nephropathic cystinosis. This case highlights the variability in the clinical presentation of cystinosis, resulting in an uncommon clinical picture of a rare disease. Given that treatment is available to prolong renal function and minimize the extra-renal manifestations of this disorder, early diagnosis is essential. It is important to raise the index of suspicion of cystinosis by recognizing its subtle morphological changes in young patients, and that nephrogenic diabetes insipidus can be secondary to this disorder.",

Pancreas allograft biopsies are most commonly performed percutaneously, transcystoscopically, or endoscopically, yet pancreas transplant surgeons often lack the skills to perform these types of biopsies. We have performed 160 laparoscopic pancreas biopsies in 95 patients. There were 146 simultaneous kidney-pancreas biopsies and 14 pancreas-only biopsies due to pancreas alone, kidney loss, or extraperitoneal kidney. Biopsies were performed for graft dysfunction (89) or per protocol (71). In 13 cases, an additional laparoscopic procedure was performed at the same operation. The pancreas diagnostic tissue yield was 91.2%; however, the pancreas could not be visualized in eight cases (5%) and in 6 cases the tissue sample was nondiagnostic (3.8%). The kidney tissue yield was 98.6%. There were four patients with intraoperative complications requiring laparotomy (2.5%) with two additional postoperative complications. Half of all these complications were kidney related. There were no episodes of pancreatic enzyme leak and there were no graft losses related to the procedure.

        "Abstract":"PURPOSE: Acute rejection of the kidney allograft remains the most important factor affecting the long-term graft outcome and is a major predictor of development of chronic damage and graft loss. Several studies have shown that early detection and treatment of subclinical rejection episodes may be beneficial for the graft outcome. The role of protocol (surveillance) biopsies and the value of donor specific antibodies (DSA) monitoring are still debatable.\nMETHODS: This is a prospective observational study involving seventeen kidney recipients transplanted in north-eastern part of Poland who underwent \"zero\", 3-month and 12-month allograft biopsies as well as DSA assessment.\nRESULTS: Histologic analysis of the biopsies showed subclinical acute cellular rejection in 17.6% of patients (two tubulointerstitial, one vascular) at 3-months post transplantation, and additional case of borderline rejection at the 12-month point. Moreover, two cases (11.8%) of polyomavirus BK nephropathy were diagnosed (one at 3 and one at 12 month point). None of the patients developed de novo DSA.\nCONCLUSIONS: Our protocol biopsies allowed us to detect significant proportion of patients with subclinical, but histologically relevant acute cellular rejection and BK nephropathy. Early therapeutic intervention had beneficial effects in a 4-year follow up.",

        "Abstract":"Histologic assessment of kidney transplant biopsies relies on cortex rather than medulla, but for microarray studies, the proportion cortex in a biopsy is typically unknown and could affect the molecular readings. The present study aimed to develop a molecular estimate of proportion cortex in biopsies and examine its effect on molecular diagnoses. Microarrays from 26 kidney transplant biopsies divided into cortex and medulla components and processed separately showed that many of the most significant differences were in glomerular genes (e.g. NPHS2, NPHS1, CLIC5, PTPRO, PLA2R1, PLCE1, PODXL, and REN). Using NPHS2 (podocin) to estimate proportion cortex, we examined whether proportion cortex influenced molecular assessment in the molecular microscope diagnostic system. In 1190 unselected kidney transplant indication biopsies (Clinicaltrials.govNCT01299168), only 11% had <50% cortex. Molecular scores for antibody-mediated rejection, T cell-mediated rejection, and injury were independent of proportion cortex. Rejection was diagnosed in many biopsies that were mostly or all medulla. Agreement in molecular diagnoses in paired cortex\/medulla samples (23\/26) was similar to biological replicates (32\/37). We conclude that NPHS2 expression can estimate proportion cortex; that proportion cortex has little influence on molecular diagnosis of rejection; and that, although histology cannot assess medulla, rejection does occur in medulla as well as cortex.",

        "Published":"2017-02-02",
        "Abstract":"Immunoglobulin (Ig) A nephropathy is one of the most common primary glomerulonephritides worldwide causing end stage renal disease in up to 20-40% of affected patients, nearly two decades post diagnosis. Kidney transplantation is the treatment of choice for patients with renal failure, secondary to glomerular diseases. However, IgA nephropathy has a strong tendency to recur in the graft, and although initially thought to be a benign condition, several reports of graft loss, due to recurrent IgA nephropathy, there have been over the last three decades. Overall graft survival has been significantly improved in kidney transplantation, as a result of reduced incidence of acute rejection, as more potent and more specific immunosuppressive agents are now available in clinical practice. Thus, the rates of IgA nephropathy and other glomerulonephritides recurrence are expected to increase, since graft survival has been improved. However, the reported incidence of IgA nephropathy recurrence in the graft varies substantially across centers, as a consequence of different levels of interest, diverse biopsy policies and differing durations of follow up, of the published studies. Notably, recurrence rates of patients receiving graft biopsies by clinical indication only, ranges from 13% to 50% with graft loss being between 1.3% and 16%. The aim of this review is to underline important pathogenetic insights of IgA nephropathy, describe the clinical course of the disease after kidney transplantation, with emphasis on the incidence of recurrence and the associated risk factors, and finally provide all available options for its management in transplant recipients.",

There was an agreement mainly for cortical compartment that may represent a perspective on the fracture risk assessment. HR-pQCT also provided some clues on the turnover status, which warrants further studies.\nINTRODUCTION: Chronic kidney disease (CKD) patients are at high risk of bone disease. Although bone biopsy is considered the best method to evaluate bone disease, it is expensive and not always available. Here we have compared, for the first time, data obtained from bone biopsy and HR-pQCT in a sample of CKD patients on dialysis.\nMETHODS: HR-pQCT and dual-energy X-ray absorptiometry (DXA) were performed in 31 CKD patients (30 on dialysis). Biopsies were analyzed by quantitative histomorphometry, and classified according to TMV.\nRESULTS: We have found an inverse correlation between radius cortical density measured by HR-pQCT, with serum, as well as histomorphometric bone remodeling markers. Trabecular density and BV\/TV measured through HR-pQCT in the distal radius correlated with trabecular and mineralized trabecular bone volume. Trabecular number, separation, and thickness obtained from HR-pQCT and from bone biopsy correlated with each other. Patients with cortical porosity on bone histomorphometry presented lower cortical density at the distal radius. Cortical density at radius was higher while bone alkaline phosphatase was lower in patients with low turnover. Combined, these parameters could identify the turnover status better than individually.\nCONCLUSIONS: There was an agreement between HR-pQCT and bone biopsy parameters, particularly in cortical compartment, which may point to a new perspective on the fracture risk assessment for CKD patients. Besides classical bone resorption markers, HR-pQCT provided some clues on the turnover status by measurements of cortical density at radius, although the significance of this finding warrants further studies.",

        "Abstract":"Gelsolin amyloidosis is a rare type of amyloidosis typically involving the cranial and peripheral nerves, but rarely the kidney. Here we report the clinical, kidney biopsy, and mass spectrometry findings in 12 cases of renal gelsolin amyloidosis. Of the 12 patients, five were men and seven were women with mean age at diagnosis of 63.8 years. Gelsolin amyloidosis was most common in Caucasians (six patients) and Asians (four patients), and included one each African-American and Hispanic patients. Nephrotic syndrome was the most common cause of biopsy, although most patients also had progressive loss of kidney function. Hematological and serological evaluation was negative in 11 patients, while one patient had a monoclonal gammopathy. The renal biopsy showed large amounts of pale eosinophilic Congo red-positive amyloid deposits typically restricted to the glomeruli. Immunofluorescence studies were negative for immunoglobulins in nine cases with three cases of smudgy glomerular staining for IgG. Electron microscopy showed mostly random arrangement of amyloid fibrils with focally parallel bundles\/sheets of amyloid fibrils present. Laser microdissection of the amyloid deposits followed by mass spectrometry showed large spectra numbers for gelsolin, serum amyloid P component, and apolipoproteins E and AIV. Furthermore, the p. Asn211Lys gelsolin mutation on mass spectrometry studies was detected in three patients by mass spectrometry, which appears to represent a renal-limited form of gelsolin amyloidosis. Thus, renal gelsolin amyloidosis is seen in older patients, presents with nephrotic syndrome and progressive chronic kidney disease, and histologically exhibits glomerular involvement. The diagnosis can be confirmed by mass spectrometry studies.",

We have previously described the renal morphology in 8 patients from El Salvador. To confirm the renal pathology, we have studied kidney biopsies from patients with MeN in Nicaragua. Follow-up urine and blood samples from both biopsy studies were collected to investigate the natural history.\nSTUDY DESIGN: Case series.\nSETTINGS & PARTICIPANTS: In the kidney biopsy study, 19 male sugarcane workers in Nicaragua with suspected MeN were investigated with questionnaires, kidney biopsies, and blood and urine analysis. Inclusion criteria were age 20 to 65 years and plasma creatinine level of 1.13 to 2.49mg\/dL or estimated glomerular filtration rate (eGFR) of 30 to 80mL\/min\/1.73m. Exclusion criteria were proteinuria with protein excretion > 3g\/24 h, uncontrolled hypertension, diabetes mellitus, or other known kidney disease. In the follow up-study, blood and urine from the kidney biopsy study in Nicaragua (n=18) and our previous biopsy study of MeN cases in El Salvador (n=7) were collected 1 to 1.5 and 2 to 2.5 years after biopsy, respectively.\nOUTCOMES: Renal morphology, clinical, and biochemical characteristics, change in eGFR per year.\nMEASUREMENTS: eGFR was calculated using the CKD-EPI creatinine (eGFR), cystatin C (eGFR), and creatinine-cystatin C (eGFR) equations.\nRESULTS: In the kidney biopsy study, participants had a mean eGFR of 57 (range, 33-96) mL\/min\/1.73m. 47% had low plasma sodium and 21% had low plasma potassium levels. 16 kidney biopsies were representative and showed glomerulosclerosis (mean, 38%), glomerular hypertrophy, and signs of chronic glomerular ischemia. Mild to moderate tubulointerstitial damage and mostly mild vascular changes were seen. In the follow up-study, median duration of follow-up was 13 (range, 13-27) months. Mean change in eGFR was -4.4±8.4 (range, -27.7 to 10.2) mL\/min\/1.73m per year. Most patients had stopped working with sugarcane cultivation.\nLIMITATIONS: 3 biopsy specimens had 4 or fewer glomeruli.\nCONCLUSIONS: This study confirms the renal morphology of MeN: chronic glomerular and tubulointerstitial damage with glomerulosclerosis and chronic glomerular ischemia.

        "Abstract":"Objective To evaluate long-term mortality and end-stage renal disease (ESRD) in a cohort of Norwegian patients with biopsy-proven lupus nephritis (LN). Methods Renal biopsies were obtained from 178 patients with LN from 1988 until 2007. Mortality rate and death causes were provided by Statistics Norway and ESRD data were provided by the Norwegian Renal Registry. Risk factors for all-cause mortality were evaluated by Cox regression. Standardized mortality ratio (SMR) was compared to observed deaths in a matched general population sample. Results Mean age was 37.6 (±14.4) years, and median time of follow-up was 8.5 years (0-26.2). Thirty-six patients (20.2%) died during follow-up. The SMR for all-cause mortality was 5.6 (Confidence interval [CI] 3.7-7.5). In an adjusted multivariate analysis proliferative glomerulonephritis (LN class IV) was independently associated with all-cause mortality; hazard ratio (HR) 2.6 (Confidence interval [CI] 1.2-5.7 p = 0.017). Main causes of death were infections (47.2%) and cardiovascular events 8 (22.2%). Thirty-six patients (20.2%) reached ESRD.

The aim of this study was to examine the allograft histology associated with dnDSA in patients with serial surveillance biopsies. We retrospectively studied adult conventional solitary kidney transplant recipients from October 2007 to May 2014. The definition of dnDSA was new donor-specific antibody (DSA) with mean fluorescence intensity (MFI) >1000. The incidence of dnDSA was 7.0% (54 of 771) over mean follow-up of 4.2 ± 1.9 years. Patients with dnDSA had reduced death-censored allograft survival (87.0% vs. 97.0% no dnDSA, p < 0.01). Moreover, 94% of patients received a biopsy after dnDSA (mean of three biopsies per patient). AMR was present in 25.0% and 52.9% of patients at dnDSA detection and at 1 year, respectively. Patients with both class I and II dnDSA had the highest rate of allograft loss. The higher the sum MFI at dnDSA detection, the higher the incidence of AMR. In conclusion, patients with dnDSA without AMR at time of detection may benefit from a follow-up biopsy within 1 year because AMR can be missed initially. In addition, the dnDSA class and sum MFI at baseline appear to be prognostic. The higher the sum MFI of dnDSA at baseline, the higher the incidence of AMR.",

        "Published":"2016-12-03",
        "Abstract":"BACKGROUND\/PURPOSE: Approximately half of patients with systemic lupus erythematosus (SLE) develop lupus nephritis (LN), a major cause of morbidity and early mortality in that disease. Prolonged renal inflammation is associated with irreversible kidney damage which confers a 30% risk of end stage renal disease (ESRD), making early, aggressive treatment mandatory. Failure to achieve therapeutic response or recurrence of renal flare often prompts repeat biopsy. However, the role of repeat biopsy in determining long-term renal prognosis remains controversial. For this reason repeat biopsies are usually not utilized unless clinical evidence of refractory or recurrent disease is already present, despite known mismatches between clinical and biopsy findings. The current study quantifies the degree to which histopathologic worsening between first and second biopsies and duration between them predicts ESRD and death.\nMETHODS: Medical records of 141 LN patients with more than one biopsy were obtained from a single large urban medical center. Cases were attained using billing codes for diagnosis and procedures from 1\/1999-1\/2015. Biopsy worsening was defined as unfavorable histopathologic classification transitions and\/or increased chronicity; if neither were present, the patient was defined as non-worsening. We used Cox proportional hazard models to study the relationship between ESRD and survival adjusting for covariates which included age at first biopsy, gender, race, initial biopsy class, and initial induction therapy.\nRESULTS: Of 630 patients screened, 141 had more than one biopsy. Advancing chronicity was detected in 48 (34.0%) and a renal class switch to worse grade of pathology was found in 54 (38.3%). At least one of these adverse second biopsy features was reported in 79 (56.0%) patients. Five years following initial biopsy, 28 (35.4%) of those with worsening histopathology on second biopsy developed ESRD, compared to 6 (9.7%) of non-worsening patients and 10 (12.7%) of patients with worsening histopathology had died compared to 2 (3.2%) of non-worsening patients. Biopsy worsening was associated with a significantly greater 15-year risk of ESRD (Hazard Ratio 4.2, p=0.0001) and death (Hazard Ratio 4.3, p=0.022), adjusting for age, gender, race, biopsy class, and treatment. Time between first and second biopsies was <1year in 32 patients, 1-5years in 81, and >5years in 28. Over a 15-year period, those with <1year between first and second biopsies (presumably enriched for patients with early clinical signs of progression) had a significantly greater risk of ESRD (Hazard Ratio 13.7, p<0.0001) and death (Hazard Ratio 16.9, p=0.0022) after adjusting for age, gender, race, biopsy class, and treatment.\nCONCLUSION: A repeat renal biopsy demonstrating worsening pathology increases the risk of ESRD and death more than four-fold compared to non-worsening patients. Given known potential mismatch between biopsy and clinical data, repeat biopsies may add important information and justify changes in treatment not considered on clinical grounds. Earlier detection of poor prognostic signs in those without early clinical deterioration might improve outcomes in enough patients to reconsider cost effectiveness of routine repeat biopsy.",

In 66 ESRD patients (median age 45 years, 68% males), BMD (by dual-energy X-ray absorptiometry, DXA), CAC score (by computed tomography, CT; n = 54), and degree of VC score (graded by histological examination of epigastric artery specimens collected at LD-Rtx; n = 55) were assessed at the time of LD-Rtx.

CAC scores correlated with BMD of legs and pelvis. BMDs of leg and pelvic sub-regions were significantly lower in patients with extensive VC. In multivariate regression analysis adjusted for age and gender, lower BMD of leg sub-region was associated with CAC score >100 AUs and extensive VC, and patients with extensive VC had significantly higher CAC score.

Diabetes and hypertension are the main causes of CKD in all high-income and middle-income countries, and also in many low-income countries. Incidence, prevalence, and progression of CKD also vary within countries by ethnicity and social determinants of health, possibly through epigenetic influence. Many people are asymptomatic or have non-specific symptoms such as lethargy, itch, or loss of appetite. Diagnosis is commonly made after chance findings from screening tests (urinary dipstick or blood tests), or when symptoms become severe. The best available indicator of overall kidney function is GFR, which is measured either via exogenous markers (eg, DTPA, iohexol), or estimated using equations. Presence of proteinuria is associated with increased risk of progression of CKD and death. Kidney biopsy samples can show definitive evidence of CKD, through common changes such as glomerular sclerosis, tubular atrophy, and interstitial fibrosis. Complications include anaemia due to reduced production of erythropoietin by the kidney; reduced red blood cell survival and iron deficiency; and mineral bone disease caused by disturbed vitamin D, calcium, and phosphate metabolism. People with CKD are five to ten times more likely to die prematurely than they are to progress to end stage kidney disease. This increased risk of death rises exponentially as kidney function worsens and is largely attributable to death from cardiovascular disease, although cancer incidence and mortality are also increased. Health-related quality of life is substantially lower for people with CKD than for the general population, and falls as GFR declines. Interventions targeting specific symptoms, or aimed at supporting educational or lifestyle considerations, make a positive difference to people living with CKD. Inequity in access to services for this disease disproportionally affects disadvantaged populations, and health service provision to incentivise early intervention over provision of care only for advanced CKD is still evolving in many countries.",

        "Abstract":"Because calcineurin inhibitor (CNI) immunosuppressive drugs induce arteriolar hyalinosis (ah) in kidney transplants, ah lesions can potentially provide information about drug exposure. We studied the relationship of ah lesions to findings and outcomes in 562 indication biopsies taken 3 days to 35 years after transplant. Prevalence of ah lesions increased with time of biopsy after transplant (TxBx). The ah scores correlated with arterial intimal thickening and atrophy-fibrosis but, unlike atrophy-fibrosis, did not increase until after 500 days because of a background of ah1 lesions in early biopsies reflecting donor aging. Correlation of ah scores with other features varied with TxBx-in early biopsies, donor age and related changes, and in very late biopsies, chronic antibody-mediated rejection and glomerulonephritis and associated lesions. After correction for TxBx, ah0 in intermediate time periods was associated with increased risk of T cell-mediated rejection and graft loss, probably because of underimmunosuppression and nonadherence. Thus, ah lesions in indication biopsies have multiple associations: donor age (early, usually ah1), chronic glomerular diseases (late, often ah2\/3), and adequate exposure to CNIs at intermediate times. This threefold TxBx-dependent complexity must be considered when interpreting indication biopsies: ah lesions often indicate adequate CNI exposure, not toxicity, and unexpected ah0 should increase vigilance for nonadherence and underimmunosuppression.",

We hypothesized that CKD is associated with systemic damage to the microcirculation, preceding macrovascular pathology. To assess the degree of \"uremic microangiopathy\", we have measured microvascular density in biopsies of the omentum of children with CKD.\nPATIENTS AND METHODS: Omental tissue was collected from 32 healthy children (0-18 years) undergoing elective abdominal surgery and from 23 age-matched cases with stage 5 CKD at the time of catheter insertion for initiation of peritoneal dialysis. Biopsies were analyzed by independent observers using either a manual or an automated imaging system for the assessment of microvascular density. Quantitative immunohistochemistry was performed for markers of autophagy and apoptosis, and for the abundance of the angiogenesis-regulating proteins VEGF-A, VEGF-R2, Angpt1 and Angpt2.\nRESULTS: Microvascular density was significantly reduced in uremic children compared to healthy controls, both by manual imaging with a digital microscope (median surface area 0.61% vs. 0.95%, p<0.0021 and by automated quantification (total microvascular surface area 0.89% vs. 1.17% p = 0.01). Density measured by manual imaging was significantly associated with age, height, weight and body surface area in CKD patients and healthy controls. In multivariate analysis, age and serum creatinine level were the only independent, significant predictors of microvascular density (r2 = 0.73). There was no immunohistochemical evidence for apoptosis or autophagy. Quantitative staining showed similar expression levels of the angiogenesis regulators VEGF-A, VEGF-receptor 2 and Angpt1 (p = 0.11), but Angpt2 was significantly lower in CKD children (p = 0.01).\nCONCLUSIONS: Microvascular density is profoundly reduced in omental biopsies of children with stage 5 CKD and associated with diminished Angpt2 signaling. Microvascular rarefaction could be an early systemic manifestation of CKD-induced cardiovascular disease.",

        "Abstract":"OBJECTIVES: The purpose of this study was to evaluate colonic pathologies in renal transplant recipients.\nMATERIALS AND METHODS: Patients with colon biopsies were selected from 1816 renal transplant recipients from January 1990 to December 2012 at Baskent University Hospital (Ankara, Turkey). Demographic and clinical findings with colon biopsies were examined.\nRESULTS: There were 84 patients who had colon biopsies after renal transplant. There were 57 male and 27 female patients (median age at renal transplant was 33 y). Chronic diarrhea was the most common clinical finding at the time of colon biopsy. The median interval from renal transplant to first colon biopsy was 48.1 ± 47.5 months. On microscopic evaluation, there were no pathologic changes in 17 patients. The remaining 67 patients had colitis (38 patients), polyps (17 patients), cytomegalovirus colitis (8 patients), and amyloidosis (4 patients). The mean interval between transplant and the diagnosis of colitis was 49.08 ± 42.6 months, amyloidosis was 47.5 ± 79.28 months, cytomegalovirus colitis was 5 ± 3.5 months, and polyps was 77.65 ± 58.8 months. There was a statistically significant difference between biopsy diagnosis and the time interval between transplant and colon biopsy (P < .01). Among 84 renal transplant recipients with colonic biopsies, 40 patients never had acute rejection episodes and 44 patients had at least 1 acute rejection episode. Seven of 8 patients with cytomegalovirus colitis, 19 of 38 with colitis, 3 of 4 with amyloidosis, and 5 of 17 with polyps had acute rejection episodes.\nCONCLUSIONS: In our report on colonic manifestations in renal transplant recipients, the most common colonic lesion was noninfectious colitis. Cytomegalovirus colitis is an important infection that affects immunosuppressed individuals, such as transplant recipients. Cytomegalovirus must be kept in mind, and thorough sectioning and immunohistochemical sta ining should be used if necessary in the presence of any clinical or histologic suspicion for infective colitis.",

In this study, we aimed to evaluate the incidence of thyroid diseases by fine-needle aspiration cytology in kidney transplant candidates and to estimate the outcomes of these patients.\nMATERIALS AND METHODS: We reevaluated thyroid fineneedle aspiration biopsies, which were performed between January 2000 and December 2015, of 181 candidates for kidney transplant. Patient demographics and thyroid ultrasonography and biopsy findings were recorded.\nRESULTS: The fine-needle aspiration biopsy findings of 181 patients were as follows: 162 were benign 5 were thyroiditis, 9 were atypia of undetermined significance\/follicular lesion of undetermined significance, and 5 were malignant. Only 13 patients (7.1%) underwent thyroid operation after fine-needle aspiration, with 5 of these patients receiving a benign diagnosis, 3 receiving diagnosis of atypia of undetermined significance\/follicular lesion of undetermined significance, and 5 patients showing malignancy. In the 5 patients with benign cytology, histopathologic findings were also benign. In the 3 patients with atypia of undetermined significance\/follicular lesion of undetermined significance, the final diagnosis was adenomatous hyperplasia. Finally, in the 5 patients (2.8%) showing malignancy, results after fine-needle aspiration showed papillary thyroid carcinoma. In the 5 patients with papillary thyroid carcinoma, 4 underwent renal transplant. Survival of these 4 patients was 92 ± 42 months without tumor recurrence.\nCONCLUSIONS: Fine-needle aspiration is a useful diagnostic modality in evaluation of thyroid nodules in kidney transplant candidates. Early detection and treatment of thyroid nodules are essential to decrease the morbidity and mortality of these patients.",

        "Abstract":"OBJECTIVES: Chronic hepatitis infection among kidney transplant recipients is not infrequent, with those with hepatitis C virus infection having worse survival. Here, we evaluated liver biopsy changes and its effects on prognosis in kidney transplant recipients.\nMATERIALS AND METHODS: Patients with liver biopsies were selected from 1275 kidney transplant recipients who were treated at Başkent University from January 1990 to December 2012. Demographic and clinical findings were evaluated, including age, sex, liver biopsy findings, amyloid and hemosiderin accumulation, and patient survival.\nRESULTS: Among 1275 renal transplant patients, only 149 patients had liver biopsies. Of 149 patients, 68 patients (45.3%) had liver biopsy only before and 81 patients had liver biopsy after transplant, with 20 of the 81 patients also having biopsy before transplant. The 81 patients who had a liver biopsy after renal transplant were included in the study. In our patient group, mean follow-up was 166 ± 29 months, female-to-male ratio was 26\/55, and mean age was 30.2 ± 9.87 years (range, 15-56 y). Only 2 of 81 liver biopsies (2.4%) were diagnosed as normal or nonspecific. Biopsy findings of the remaining 79 patients (97.6%) showed variable pathologies, including hepatocellular damage and minimal cholestatic changes in 29 patients (35.8%), chronic nonviral hepatitis in 9 (11.1%), and viral hepatitis in 41 (50.6%). The mean time between the first liver biopsy taken before transplant and second biopsy after transplant was 44.5 ± 38.0 months (range, 11-139 mo). Among 81 patients, 6 (7.4%) showed amyloid deposition and 13 (16.0%) showed hemosiderosis.\nCONCLUSIONS: Testing for viral infections is critical in transplant recipients. It is well known that these infections can affect the frequency of rejection episodes and also negatively affect survival in solidorgan transplant recipients. Livers should be evaluated by biopsy even if the variance in liver enzymes or serology is minimal.",

The renal outcomes of the arterial\/arteriolar nephrosclerosis patients were assessed by performing logistic and Cox regression analyses. A Kaplan-Meier analysis was used to evaluate the impact of hyperuricemia (HU) on kidney survival. The renal outcomes of patients with and without HU were compared by using a propensity score-matched cohort.\nRESULTS: The logistic regression models showed no significant differences in renal outcomes, according to baseline parameters or follow-up parameters, except the serum UA value and body mass index (BMI). Baseline serum UA level had the highest odds ratio (OR) for estimated glomerular filtration rate (eGFR) decline (OR, 1.86; 95% confidence interval (CI), 1.12 to 3.45), among the parameters assessed. In the multivariate Cox regression analysis, HU (UA ≥8.0 mg\/dL) (P=0.01) and BMI (P=0.03) were significantly associated with a ≥50% eGFR decline or ESRD. The Kaplan-Meier analysis in the propensity score-matched cohort indicated that the renal survival rate of the group of arterial\/arteriolar nephrosclerosis patients with HU was significantly lower than that of the group without HU (log rank, P=0.03).\nCONCLUSION: The results of this study suggest that the baseline serum UA value can serve as a renal outcome predictor in arterial\/arteriolar nephrosclerosis patients.",

        "Published":"2016-10-12",
        "Abstract":"BACKGROUND: Patients on renal replacement therapy are often unaware of their underlying condition and hence suffer from so-called end-stage renal disease (ESRD) of unknown origin. However, an exact diagnosis is not only important for better estimating the prognosis, but also when preparing for kidney transplantation. Whilst patients with FSGS without a confirmed genetic cause have a high recurrence rate in the transplanted organ, patients with a mutation generally exhibit no recurrence and have a good prognosis. Furthermore, renal biopsy, which may be helpful for differential diagnosis, is usually contraindicated in end-stage kidneys. We here present the case of familial ESRD of unknown origin, which could be resolved by targeted genetic testing prior to planning of kidney transplantation.\nCASE PRESENTATION: A 32-year-old female with ESRD and nephrotic range proteinuria was admitted to our clinic. Family-history revealed that both mother and maternal grandmother had ESRD of unknown origin. As renal biopsy was impossible due to atrophic kidneys, we performed mutation analysis of genes known for dominant forms of FSGS and found a novel heterozygous mutation of INF2 (c.485 T > C, p.Leu162Pro). The same mutation could be detected in the index patient's mother (ESRD at age 50) and three brothers with normal serum-creatinine but mid or low range proteinuria.\nCONCLUSIONS: Genetic testing is warranted in families with ESRD of unknown origin and may provide a robust diagnosis even without kidney biopsy. It will help detecting relatives at risk who have to be excluded from potential kidney donation and who may benefit from timely initiation of protective measures in order to slow down disease progression.",

        "Abstract":"This study aims to describe the unique characteristics of absorption fever in patients with a hematoma after percutaneous renal biopsy (PRB) and distinguish it from secondary infection of hematoma.We retrospectively studied 2639 percutaneous renal biopsies of native kidneys. We compared the clinical characteristics between 2 groups: complication group (gross hematuria and\/or perirenal hematoma) and no complication group. The axillary temperature of patients with a hematoma who presented with fever was measured at 06:00, 10:00, 14:00, and 18:00. The onset and duration of fever and the highest body temperature were recorded. Thereafter, we described the time distribution of absorption fever and obtained the curve of fever pattern.Of 2639 patients, PRB complications were observed in 154 (5.8%) patients. Perirenal hematoma was the most common complication, which occurred in 118 (4.5%) of biopsies, including 74 small hematoma cases (thickness ≤3 cm) and 44 large hematoma cases (thickness >3 cm). Major complications were observed in only 6 (0.2%) cases resulting from a large hematoma. Of 118 patients with a perirenal hematoma, absorption fever was observed in 48 cases. Furthermore, large hematomas had a 5.23-fold higher risk for absorption fever than the small ones.Blood pressure, renal insufficiency, and prothrombin time could be risk factors for complications. Fever is common in patients with hematoma because of renal biopsy and is usually noninfectious. Evaluation of patients with post-biopsy fever is necessary to identify any obvious infection sources. If no focus is identified, empiric antibiotic therapy should not be initiated nor should prophylactic antibiotics be extended for prolonged durations. Absorption fevers will resolve in time without specific therapeutic interventions.",

        "Abstract":"An unbalanced microbiome may lead to disease by creating aberrant immune responses. A recent association of cellular rejection with the development of interstitial fibrosis and tubular atrophy (IFTA) suggests the role of immune-mediated tissue injury. We hypothesized that developing IFTA correlates with altered urinary tract microbiomes (UMBs). UMBs at two serial time points, 1 and 6-8 months posttransplant, were assessed by 16S microbial ribosomal gene sequencing in 25 patients developing biopsy-proven IFTA compared to 23 transplant patients with normal biopsies and excellent function (TX) and 20 healthy nontransplant controls (HC). Streptococcus, the dominant genera in HC males, was lower in IFTA and TX males at 1 month compared to HCs. At 6-8 months, Streptococcus was further decreased in IFTA males, but normalized in TX. IFTA males and females had increases in number of genera per sample at 6-8 months. UMB composition varied substantially between individuals in all groups. Despite the wide variation in UMBs between individuals, IFTA was associated with a loss in dominant resident urinary microbes in males, and a parallel increase in nonresident, pathogenic bacteria in males and females. UMB changes may contribute to IFTA development by alteration of the host immune response.",

Safety in patients with pulmonary hypertension is controversial and many bronchoscopists consider this as a contraindication for the procedure.\nOBJECTIVES: To evaluate safety of bronchoscopy in patients with echocardiographic pulmonary hypertension and to compare with patients without it.\nMETHODS: Retrospective analysis of patients who underwent bronchoscopic transbronchial biopsy, endobronchial biopsy and\/or endobronchial ultrasound-guided transbronchial needle aspiration. Patients were divided into two groups based on echocardiographic results: control group with systolic pulmonary artery pressure <36 and a group with elevated systolic pulmonary artery pressure (eSPAP) ≥36.\nRESULTS: One-hundred and ninety patients met the study criteria. Patients in the control group were younger with a lower incidence of chronic kidney disease. There was no difference in prevalence of congestive heart failure, obstructive airway disease, malignancy, liver disease, coagulopathy, use of antiplatelet agent or anticoagulant drugs. Incidence of minor bleeding due to bronchoscopic biopsies was 4.8% in both groups (p = 1.00). Incidence of major bleeding was similar in the groups (one patient in each group). In the control group, one patient had pneumothorax and another required prolonged mechanical ventilation (>4 h). In the eSPAP group, two patients required prolonged mechanical ventilation.

We identified 281 cases of renal amyloidosis from 20,997 cases enrolled into the J-RBR from 2007 to 2014. Systolic blood pressure (SBP) and diastolic blood pressure (DBP) were compared among the levels of ages, amount of urine protein excretion (AUPE) or CKD G stages.\nRESULTS: The prevalence of renal amyloidosis was 1.3 % (281\/20,997). DBP significantly decreased in higher age quartiles (P = 0.034). SBP and DBP did not increase in the progression of AUPE levels and CKD G stages. In multiple regression analysis, eGFR was a significant independent factor for SBP in all cases and a subgroup without hypertensive agents. There was a reverse significant relationship between SBP and eGFR.\nCONCLUSION: Blood pressure did not significantly increase in elderly and much proteinuric condition in renal amyloidosis. The progression of CKD and decrease of eGFR did not produce the higher SBP. The mechanism underlying these results remains unclear; however, they are unique features of renal amyloidosis.

Kidney biopsy revealed the presence of atypical multinucleated CD138 plasma cells with voluminous nuclei stained exclusively with a κ antibody. Electron microscopy showed mesangial and segmental parietal electron-dense, nonorganized hyaline deposits without immunogold labeling for the κ light chain. The bone marrow aspirate revealed 6% of apparently mature plasmocytes without dystrophy. We therefore concluded that the patient had an indolent multiple myeloma with specific renal involvement in the form of malignant monotypic interstitial plasmacytic infiltration. We initiated a specific chemotherapy regimen including bortezomib-cyclophosphamide-dexamethasone. After 4 months of follow-up, creatinine levels had improved slightly and free κ light-chain levels had decreased significantly within the normal range.\nCONCLUSION: This case highlights the need to consider neoplastic interstitial plasma cell infiltration systematically in patients diagnosed with an apparently benign monoclonal gammopathy and to consider adaptation of the chemotherapy regimen, to improve renal function.",

The term renal osteodystrophy, classically used for the nomination of CKD-associated bone disorder, has been limited to the histologic description of bone lesions, requiring the use of bone biopsy. Biochemical markers and imaging tools do not adequately predict the complex bone changes that are observed in renal osteodystrophy. Parathyroid hormone, which is a universally used biomarker of bone turnover in clinical practice, lacks specificity and sensitivity. Therefore, tetracycline double-labelled transiliac bone biopsy, with bone histology and histomorphometric evaluation, remains the best clinical tool to discriminate bone turnover and to evaluate the other dimensions of renal osteodystrophy. This review will focus on the value of classic bone histomorphometric analysis of trabecular bone in CKD patients and unfold new perspectives of this diagnostic tool, including cortical bone evaluation and bone tissue immunohistochemistry.",

        "Abstract":"Renal biopsy was performed for the first time more than one century ago, but its clinical use was routinely introduced in the 1950s. It is still an essential tool for diagnosis and choice of treatment of several primary or secondary kidney diseases. Moreover, it may help to know the expected time of end stage renal disease. The indications are represented by nephritic and\/or nephrotic syndrome and rapidly progressive acute renal failure of unknown origin. Nowadays, it is performed mainly by nephrologists and radiologists using a 14-18 gauges needle with automated spring-loaded biopsy device, under real-time ultrasound guidance. Bleeding is the major primary complication that in rare cases may lead to retroperitoneal haemorrhage and need for surgical intervention and\/or death. For this reason, careful evaluation of risks and benefits must be taken into account, and all procedures to minimize the risk of complications must be observed. After biopsy, an observation time of 12-24 h is necessary, whilst a prolonged observation may be needed rarely. In some cases it could be safer to use different techniques to reduce the risk of complications, such as laparoscopic or transjugular renal biopsy in patients with coagulopathy or alternative approaches in obese patients. Despite progress in medicine over the years with the introduction of more advanced molecular biology techniques, renal biopsy is still an irreplaceable tool for nephrologists.",

The aim of this study was to identify a gene set capable of predicting renal allografts at risk of progressive injury due to fibrosis.\nMETHODS: This Genomics of Chronic Allograft Rejection (GoCAR) study is a prospective, multicentre study. We prospectively collected biopsies from renal allograft recipients (n=204) with stable renal function 3 months after transplantation. We used microarray analysis to investigate gene expression in 159 of these tissue samples. We aimed to identify genes that correlated with the Chronic Allograft Damage Index (CADI) score at 12 months, but not fibrosis at the time of the biopsy. We applied a penalised regression model in combination with permutation-based approach to derive an optimal gene set to predict allograft fibrosis. The GoCAR study is registered with ClinicalTrials.gov, number NCT00611702.\nFINDINGS: We identified a set of 13 genes that was independently predictive for the development of fibrosis at 1 year (ie, CADI-12 ≥2). The gene set had high predictive capacity (area under the curve [AUC] 0·967), which was superior to that of baseline clinical variables (AUC 0·706) and clinical and pathological variables (AUC 0·806). Furthermore routine pathological variables were unable to identify which histologically normal allografts would progress to fibrosis (AUC 0·754), whereas the predictive gene set accurately discriminated between transplants at high and low risk of progression (AUC 0·916). The 13 genes also accurately predicted early allograft loss (AUC 0·842 at 2 years and 0·844 at 3 years). We validated the predictive value of this gene set in an independent cohort from the GoCAR study (n=45, AUC 0·866) and two independent, publically available expression datasets (n=282, AUC 0·831 and n=24, AUC 0·972).\nINTERPRETATION: Our results suggest that this set of 13 genes could be used to identify kidney transplant recipients at risk of allograft loss before the development of irreversible damage, thus allowing therapy to be modified to prevent progression to fibrosis.\nFUNDING: National Institutes of Health.",

        "Abstract":"PURPOSE: To evaluate the safety and efficacy of percutaneous radiofrequency ablation (RFA) for localised renal cell carcinoma (RCC) and examine potential associations between age, gender, tumour size, location, chronic kidney disease, comorbidities, learning curve and local recurrence.\nMETHODS: We retrospectively analysed survival outcomes for patients with biopsy-proven RCC treated by RFA at Westmead Hospital. Complication data were gathered from all patients that underwent renal RFA. 3 and 5 year local recurrence-free (RFS), disease-free (DFS) and overall survival (OS) outcomes were reported. Univariate and multivariate analysis was used to examine each potential predictor.\nRESULTS: A total of 168 patients were eligible for the study. Forty-eight patients with biopsy-proven RCC had minimum 3-year follow-up. Our complication rate was 1.2 % (2\/168) and local recurrence rate 10.4 % (5\/48). Five-year RFS, DFS and OS were 86.8, 82.3 and 92.6 % on a median 4.1-year follow-up (IQR 3.4-4.9). None of the patient or tumour-specific characteristics were associated with RFS.\nCONCLUSION: Radiofrequency ablation performed at our centre was a safe and effective procedure with low complication rates and durable RFS.

        "Abstract":"Histologic diagnosis of antibody-mediated rejection (ABMR) in kidney transplant biopsies uses lesion score cutoffs such as 0 versus >0 rather than actual scores and requires donor-specific antibody (DSA); however, cutoffs lose information, and DSA is not always reliable. Using microarray-derived molecular ABMR scores as a histology-independent estimate of ABMR in 703 biopsies, we reassessed criteria for ABMR to determine relative importance of various lesions, the utility of equations using actual scores rather than cutoffs, and the potential for diagnosing ABMR when DSA is unknown or negative. We confirmed that the important features for ABMR diagnosis were peritubular capillaritis (ptc), glomerulitis (g), glomerular double contours, DSA and C4d staining, but we questioned some features: arterial fibrosis, vasculitis, acute tubular injury, and sum of ptc+g scores. Regression equations using lesion scores predicted molecular ABMR more accurately than score cutoffs (area under the curve 0.85-0.86 vs. 0.75). DSA positivity improved accuracy, but regression equations predicted ABMR with moderate accuracy when DSA was unknown. Some biopsies without detectable DSA had high probability of ABMR by regression, although most had HLA antibody. We concluded that regression equations using lesion scores plus DSA maximized diagnostic accuracy and can estimate probable ABMR when DSA is unknown or undetectable.",

Although its etiology varies, recent reports indicated that some young male patients with FGS had underlying Dent disease. We describe the case of a 14-year-old Japanese boy who presented with persistent non-nephrotic range proteinuria, hematuria, and renal insufficiency. The patient was initially diagnosed as having FGS associated with scattered tubulointerstitial fibrosis. Although he had neither nephrocalcinosis nor family history of renal disease including urolithiasis, increased excretion of urinary β2 microglobulin was noted. Genetic analysis for Dent disease indicated a mutation (c.726 + 1G > A) in Chloride Channel, Voltage-Sensitive 5 (CLCN5). Given a recent hypothesis that Dent disease may be underrecognized in children with FGS, a careful diagnostic evaluation for possible underlying Dent disease should be considered in young boys who present with persistent albuminuria associated with high-grade low-molecular-weight proteinuria.",

        "Abstract":"Kidney transplantation is the most effective means of treating children with end-stage kidney disease, and yet, there continues to be a limited \"life span\" of transplanted kidneys in paediatric recipients. Early graft monitoring, using the surveillance biopsy, has the potential to extend renal allograft survival in paediatric recipients. The surveillance biopsy provides important and timely information about acute and chronic graft pathology, particularly SCR and calcineurin inhibitor-induced nephrotoxicity, which can subsequently guide management decisions and improve long-term graft survival. The ostensible value of the surveillance biopsy is furthered by the limitations of conventional renal functional studies. However, there is still much debate surrounding the surveillance biopsy in paediatric recipients, particularly in regard to its overall utility, safety and timing. This review discusses the current literature regarding the utility, safety, and potential predictive value of surveillance biopsies for guiding post-transplant management in paediatric renal allograft recipients, as well as the viability of other potentially newer non-invasive strategies for renal allograft monitoring.",

The prevalence and the nature of non diabetic renal disease (NDRD) among diabetic patients in Israel have not yet been evaluated.\nOBJECTIVE: To assess pathological findings of kidney biopsies conducted in patients with diabetes mellitus.\nMETHODS: A total of 200 native kidney biopsies were performed during the study period. Patients who had a diagnosis of diabetes mellitus were included in the study. Clinical data and pathological findings were retrospectively collected and analyzed.\nRESULTS: The cohort included 34 patients, median age 61.8 years. The male to female ratio was 25:9; mean serum creatinine was 1.8 ± 1.2 mg\/dl The duration of diabetes was significantly shorter in patients with NDRD (6.8 ± 7.1 years vs. 13.0 ± 9.6 years in diabetic nephropathy (DN) or combined), whereas insulin therapy was significantly more common in patients with DN (72% vs 5% in NDRD). Diabetic retinopathy was documented in 57% of patients with diabetic nephropathy but wasn't documented in any patient with NDRD. Prevalence of NDRD, DN and combined pathology was 58.8%, 32.4% and 8.8% respectively. Neither the level of proteinuria nor the rate of renal function deterioration could predict pathological findings in the biopsy. The most common NDRD disease was nephrosclerosis.\nCONCLUSIONS: Non-diabetic renal disease was common.

        "Abstract":"Apolipoprotein A-IV associated amyloidosis (AApoAIV amyloidosis) is a rare cause of amyloidosis with only a single reported case. Here we describe the clinical, biopsy, and mass spectrometry characteristics of 11 cases of renal AApoAIV amyloidosis encompassing 9 men and 2 women with a mean age at diagnosis of 63.5 years. Progressive chronic kidney disease (mean serum creatinine 2.9 mg\/dl) was the most common cause for biopsy with proteinuria absent or minimal in all except one. Hematological and serological evaluation was negative in 9 patients, while 2 had a monoclonal gammopathy. The renal biopsy findings were striking and showed large amounts of eosinophilic Congo-red positive amyloid deposits restricted to the renal medulla with sparing of the renal cortex. In 6 cases, peritubular amyloid was noted in addition to the interstitial involvement. Immunofluorescence studies were negative for immunoglobulins. Electron microscopy showed nonbranching fibrils measuring 7 to 10 nm in diameter. Laser microdissection of the amyloid deposits followed by mass spectrometry showed large spectra number (a semiquantitative measure of abundance) for AApoAIV protein ranging from 49 to 169 (average 85), serum amyloid protein (average 19), and apolipoprotein E (average 48). Importantly, no peptides were detected for any other forms of known amyloidogenic precursor proteins. Thus, renal AApoAIV amyloidosis typically presents with progressive chronic kidney disease and histologically exhibits extensive medullary involvement with sparing of the cortex. The diagnosis is best established by mass spectrometry. Hence, a high degree of suspicion and examination of the renal medulla is required to make the diagnosis.",

However, a consensus of the evaluation and explanation of the IMH prognosis is controversial among physicians. Here, we present the natural course of IMH together with the pathological diagnosis and features to provide supportive data when approaching patients with IMH. We retrospectively evaluated 350 patients with IMH who underwent a renal biopsy between 2002 and 2011, and the pathological diagnosis and chronic histopathological features (glomerulosclerosis, interstitial fibrosis, and tubular atrophy) were reviewed. Deterioration of renal function was examined during follow up. The patients with IMH were evaluated for a mean of 86 months. IgA nephropathy was the most common diagnosis in 164 patients (46.9%). Chronic histopathological changes were observed in 166 (47.4%) but was not correlated with proteinuria or a decline in renal function. Ten patients developed proteinuria, and all of them had IgA nephropathy. Three patients progressed to chronic kidney disease with an estimated glomerular filtration rate < 60 mL\/min\/1.73 m(2) but none progressed to end stage renal disease. In conclusion, IMH had a generally benign course during 7-years of observation, although IgA nephropathy should be monitored if it progresses to proteinuria.

The mechanism of vascular calcification in CKD patients remains unclear. This study is aimed to evaluate the clinical association between abnormal Wnt pathways and incidence of vascular calcification in ESRD patients.\nMETHODS: A total of 41 ESRD patients were enrolled in this study. Tissue samples of radial arteries were obtained during arteriovenous fistula surgery. Expression of Wnt pathways was assessed by immunohistochemistry with antibodies against catenin, GSK-3beta and Wnt-5a. Correlation analysis was performed to evaluate the association between Wnt activities and vascular calcification rates.\nRESULTS: Immunohistochemical stainings demonstrated that increased expressions of β-catenin, GSK-3beta and Wnt-5a were mostly observed in the subjects with vascular calcification. Further correlation analysis identified that β-catenin expression in overall arterial samples was significantly associated with the expressions of GSK-3beta and Wnt-5a. We also found significant correlation between expressions of GSK-3beta and Wnt-5a in the studied samples. The multivariate logistic regression analysis demonstrated that Wnt-5a was an independent risk factor for vascular calcification in patients with ESRD.\nCONCLUSION: Our study identifies increased activation of Wnt pathways in the arteries of patients with ESRD, which is significantly correlated with the incidence of vascular calcification. These findings support Wnt pathways as a potential target for future therapy of vascular calcification in CKD.",

We compared intrarenal hemodynamic parameters to biopsy findings of glomerular sclerosis, tubular atrophy, interstitial fibrosis, crescents, arteriolosclerosis, and clinical variables in 100 patients. A positive correlation exists between renal function and percentage of glomerular sclerosis (P <0.01, r = 0.26), conversely a negative correlation exists between glomerular filtrate rate and percentage of glomerular sclerosis(P <0.0001, r = -0.35). The percentage of glomerular sclerosis correlate positively with pulsatile index (PI) (P <0.05, r = 0.21) and renal resistive index (RI) (P <0.05, r = 0.20). The percentage of crescents correlates positively with PI(P <0.05, r = 0.21) and RI (P <0.05, r = 0.20). Classifying arteriolosclerosis in four groups according to a severity scale, from absence to severe, PI (P <0.05) and RI (P <0.01) were significantly different. In the post hoc analysis, the median values of PI and RI are significantly different in patients with severe arteriolosclerosis than others. Ultrasound examination is a non-invasive diagnostic technique used on patients with suspected or established renal disease. Our study shows a close correlation between kidney function, ultrasound parameters, and histological findings. Measurement of renal parenchymal resistance by ultrasound could be used in association with biopsy and glomerular function for the evaluation of renal damage in patients with glomerulonephritis.",

        "Abstract":"BACKGROUND: Approximately one-third of individuals with type 2 diabetes mellitus will eventually develop diabetic nephropathy (DN). Impaired renal function in type 2 diabetics may also be secondary to non-diabetic renal disease (NDRD). NDRD in type 2 diabetics may occur alone in the absence of DN or may be superimposed on DN. Renal biopsy maybe indicated to establish the correct diagnosis and to ascertain the severity of glomerular and tubulointerstitial pathology.\nCASE: We report a patient with type 2 diabetes mellitus and chronic renal insufficiency who developed worsening of renal function in the setting of staphylococcal infection and antibiotic use.\nCONCLUSION: Renal biopsy revealed IgA-dominant post-infectious glomerulonephritis and acute interstitial nephritis superimposed on diabetic glomerulosclerosis. Accumulating evidence indicates that, NDRD accounts for impaired renal function in a significant number of patients with type 2 diabetes mellitus. The presence of clinical, biochemical, and radiological features that suggest NDRD should prompt pathological evaluation of the kidney.",

Renal survival rates and relationships between clinico-pathological characteristics and outcomes were assessed.\nRESULTS: A total of 194 patients were enrolled; the mean age at biopsy was 43.8 years, and male gender predominated (82.5 %). The median duration of hypertension was 5.0 years, and the mean systolic and diastolic blood pressures were 195 ± 37 and 126 ± 26 mmHg, respectively. The median serum creatinine (Scr) level, estimated glomerular filtration rate (eGFR), and proteinuria level were 1.61 mg\/dl, 49.6 ml\/min\/1.73 m(2), and 0.80 g\/24 h, respectively. BN and MN were found by renal biopsy in 55.2 % and 44.8 % of patients, respectively. At biopsy, MN patients were younger, and had higher median Scr and proteinuria levels, higher incidences of anemia, hypertensive heart disease and hypertensive retinopathy, and worse renal outcomes than BN patients. During a median follow-up period of 3.0 years, 36 patients (18.6 %) reached end-stage renal disease (ESRD), and the 5- and 10-year cumulative renal survival rates for HN patients were 84.5 % and 48.9 %, respectively. A decreased baseline eGFR, an increased baseline proteinuria level, anemia, increased percentage of global glomerulosclerosis and tubular atrophy and interstitial fibrosis (TAIF) were independent predictors of future ESRD.\nCONCLUSIONS: The clinico-pathological characteristics and prognoses were significantly different between the MN and BN patients.

It is a major risk factor for the high prevalence of chronic kidney disease. We aimed to analyse the clinical presentation, pathological spectra, treatment and outcomes of biopsy-proven acute postinfectious glomerulonephritis in the Northern Territory.\nMETHODS: We performed a retrospective cohort analysis of all adult patients (≥18 years) who were diagnosed with acute postinfectious glomerulonephritis on native renal biopsies from 01\/01\/2004 to 31\/05\/2014. The outcome measure was end-stage renal disease requiring long-term dialysis.\nRESULTS: Forty-three of 340 patients who had renal biopsies had acute postinfectious glomerulonephritis. Most were Aboriginals (88.4%). They had co-morbidities; diabetes mellitus (60.5%), hypertension (60.5%) and smoking (56.4%). Forty-nine per cent had multiple pathologies on biopsy.

The present study was undertaken to investigate the HBV-GN genotypes and its clinical relevance in Chinese children.\nMETHODS: A total of 41 HBV-infected children diagnosed with HBV-GN were enrolled in the study. All patients underwent liver and kidney biopsy. The genotypes and cccDNA were detected in their serum samples to analyze the relationship between HBV genotypes and clinical characteristics, cccDNA, and pathology.\nRESULTS: Among the 41 children with HBV-GN, 29 (70.7%) had genotype C, 10 (24.4%) had genotype B, 2 (4.9%) had genotype B\/C, and none of them had genotype non-B\/C. Most children had genotypes B or C; moreover, the genotype C was the most frequent one. The incidence of hematuria and albuminuria, reduction in complement C3, increase in serum alanine aminotransferase levels and renal insufficiency in the children with genotype C were significantly higher than those in the children with genotype B (P<0.05); however, there was no statistically significant difference in hypertension and hepatomegaly (P>0.05). The frequency of HBV cccDNA positive in the genotype C group was significantly higher than that in the genotype B group (72.4% vs. 30.0%, P<0.05).

        "Abstract":"BACKGROUND: Percutaneous renal biopsy is a valuable procedure in the management of and prognostication for patients with renal disease. Complications, although rare, occur with renal biopsies. Arteriovenous fistulas and heavy bleeding are notable complications. In this report, we describe simple suturing of the biopsy tract for salvage of a graft destined for a nephrectomy due to a profusely bleeding arteriovenous fistula.\nCASE PRESENTATION: A 20-year-old Sri Lankan man with end-stage renal disease due to steroid-resistant nephrotic syndrome underwent a renal transplant. He had poor urine output following the surgery, and a renal biopsy was performed to diagnose his renal pathology. He experienced poorly controlled postprocedural hypertension, and he had four episodes of gross hematuria that required blood transfusion. Coil embolization was delayed due to technical issues, and a graft nephrectomy was planned following the fourth episode of hematuria, which was the most severe. A Doppler scan revealed a slender, iatrogenic arteriovenous fistula corresponding to the biopsy tract, with very high flow rates. With knowledge of the anatomy of the fistula, we performed suturing of the tract to obliterate the fistula as a last resort to salvage the graft. The surgical procedure stopped the bleeding, and the patient made a full recovery with an excellent quality of life.\nCONCLUSIONS: In our patient, a renal transplant biopsy revealed acute tubular necrosis. The incidence and treatment of fistulas and differences in complication rates among native and graft kidney biopsies are discussed.",

        "Published":"2016-03-15",
        "Abstract":"Interstitial fibrosis and tubular atrophy (IFTA) is found in approximately 25% of 1-year biopsies posttransplant. It is known that IFTA correlates with decreased graft survival when histological evidence of inflammation is present. Identifying the mechanistic etiology of IFTA is important to understanding why long-term graft survival has not changed as expected despite improved immunosuppression and dramatically reduced rates of clinical acute rejection (AR) (Services UDoHaH. http:\/\/www.ustransplant.org\/annual_reports\/current\/509a_ki.htm). Gene expression profiles of 234 graft biopsy samples were obtained with matching clinical and outcome data. Eighty-one IFTA biopsies were divided into subphenotypes by degree of histological inflammation: IFTA with AR, IFTA with inflammation, and IFTA without inflammation. Samples with AR (n = 54) and normally functioning transplants (TX; n = 99) were used in comparisons. A novel analysis using gene coexpression networks revealed that all IFTA phenotypes were strongly enriched for dysregulated gene pathways and these were shared with the biopsy profiles of AR, including IFTA samples without histological evidence of inflammation. Thus, by molecular profiling we demonstrate that most IFTA samples have ongoing immune-mediated injury or chronic rejection that is more sensitively detected by gene expression profiling. These molecular biopsy profiles correlated with future graft loss in IFTA samples without inflammation.",

We analyzed epidemiological data and the main indications for renal biopsy with a systematic, evidence-based review at current literature.\nSUMMARY: There is a high discrepancy observed in biopsy rates and in the epidemiology of glomerular diseases worldwide, related to the different time frame of the analyzed reports, lack of data collection, the different reference source population and the heterogeneity of indications. The evidence-based analysis of indications showed that renal biopsy should be crucial in adults with nephrotic syndrome or urinary abnormalities as coexistent hematuria and proteinuria and in corticosteroid resistant-children with severe proteinuria. The knowledge of renal histology can change the clinical management in patients with acute kidney injury significantly, after the exclusion of pre-renal or obstructive causes of kidney damage. Scarce evidence indicates that renal biopsy can be useful in patients with advanced chronic kidney disease and its use should always be considered after weighing the benefits and potential risks. Renal biopsy should be crucial in patients with renal involvement due to systemic disease. In patients with diabetes with atypical features, renal biopsy may be fundamental to diagnose an unexpected parenchymal disease mislabeled as diabetic nephropathy. Finally, in elderly patients, the indications and the risks are not different from those in the general population.\nKEY MESSAGE: Renal biopsy still remains a concrete approach for managing a substantial percentage of renal diseases.",

        "Abstract":"BACKGROUND AND OBJECTIVES: There has been little published information on risk factors for poor long-term outcome in adult biopsy-proven minimal change disease (MCD).\nMETHODS: Data from sixty-three adult, biopsy-proven primary MCD patients treated at a tertiary university hospital between 2003 and 2013 were analyzed. Baseline clinical and pathologic factors were assessed for the associations with composite outcome of creatinine doubling, end stage renal disease, or all-cause mortality.\nRESULTS: During a median (interquartile) 5.0 (2.8-5.0) years, the composite outcome occurred in 11.1% (7\/63) of patients. The rate of glomerular immune deposits was 23.8% (15\/63). Patients with glomerular immune deposits showed a significantly lower urine protein creatinine ratio than those without deposits (P = 0.033). The rate of non-responders was significantly higher in patients with glomerular immune deposits than in those without deposits (P = 0.033). In patients with deposits, 26.7% (4\/15) developed the composite outcome, while only 6.3% (3\/48) developed the composite outcome among those without deposits (P = 0.049). In multivariate Cox proportional hazards regression analysis, the presence of glomerular immune deposits was the only factor associated with development of the composite outcome (hazard ratio: 2.310, 95% confidence interval: 1.031-98.579, P = 0.047).\nCONCLUSION: Glomerular immune deposits were associated with increased risk of a composite outcome in adult MCD patients. The higher rate of non-responders in patients with deposits might be related to the poor outcome. Future study is needed.",

It is an invasive method and may lead to severe complications. The aim of this study was to determine the evaluation of percutaneous liver biopsy complications in patients with chronic viral hepatitis.\nMATERIALS AND METHODS: 1165 patients, who were followed with the diagnosis of chronic viral hepatitis and who were applied percutaneous liver biopsy between January 2000 and February 2013 at the out-patient clinic of Infectious Diseases and Clinical Microbiology, were included in the study.\nRESULTS: Of 1165 patients who underwent liver biopsy, 196 (86 male, 110 female) were diagnosed with chronic hepatitis C, 969 (559 male, 410 female) were diagnosed with chronic hepatitis B. The mean age was 43.3 and 55.4% were male. 11% of the patients were diagnosed with chronic renal failure and underwent haemodialysis.

        "Abstract":"BACKGROUND: Alport syndrome (AS) is an inherited glomerular disease associated with hearing and eye defects; its morbidity is a public health issue in developed countries. AS results from mutations in COL4A3, COL4A4, or COL4A5 genes, respectively encoding the alpha-3, alpha-4, and alpha-5 chains of type IV collagen, a major component of the renal glomerular basement membrane (GBM). The diagnosis is usually confirmed by a renal biopsy showing a thinning\/thickening of the GBM, with a longitudinal splitting of the lamina densa.\nCASE DIAGNOSIS: We report the case of a 10-year-old patient who presented multiple episodes of macroscopic hematuria. On the renal biopsy, the electron microscopy analysis of the GBM was normal, as was the COL4A5 immunofluorescence assay. Genetic analyses showed a homozygous duplication of exons 44 to 47 of the COL4A3 gene, confirming the diagnosis of autosomal recessive AS.\nCONCLUSIONS: Our report suggests that in patients with clinical evidence of AS, genetic testing should be performed whenever pathological analysis is not in favor of AS diagnosis. This will ensure that AS patients benefit from an early diagnosis, adequate treatment, and that end-stage renal disease (ESRD) onset is delayed.",

It can provide diagnostic precision and prognostic value and guide in therapeutic options for many renal diseases.\nOBJECTIVES: This report describes the indication, histopathological patterns, and epidemiology of renal diseases in children in India.\nPATIENTS AND METHODS: This is a single-center study on renal biopsies performed between January 2008 and December 2013 in 346 children (age ≤ 14 years).\nRESULTS: Eleven (3.17%) biopsies were inadequate, and 335 biopsies were considered for analysis. The mean age was 7.91 ± 3.04 years with a predominance of males (68.1%). Nephrotic syndrome (46.2%) was the most common indication, followed by urinary abnormality (41.19%), acute nephritic syndrome (10.74%), and chronic renal failure (1.79 %). Primary glomerulonephritis (GN) was predominant (81.79%), and secondary GN constituted 16.12% of the biopsies. Primary GN included mesangial proliferative GN (MePGN), IgM nephropathy, focal segmental glomerulosclerosis, minimal change disease, IgA nephropathy, membranoproliferative GN, membranous nephropathy, crescentic GN, and post-infectious GN. Secondary GN revealed lupus nephritis, hemolytic uremic syndrome, amyloidosis, and hypertensive nephropathy. Tubulointerstitial nephritis was observed in 2.08%. The most common histological pattern of primary GN was MePGN (20%) and in secondary GN it was lupus nephritis (7.76%).\nCONCLUSIONS: The present study provides data on the epidemiology of renal diseases in children in India and will be helpful for developing a national registry and devising therapeutic guidelines.",

        "Abstract":"OBJECTIVE: Advanced glycation end products (AGEs) of collagens appear to contribute to microvascular complications in diabetes. Do high concentrations of AGEs in skin collagen predict accelerated progression of these complications after 6 years and indicate the need for tighter anti-diabetic treatment?\nDESIGN AND METHODS: We measured two AGE parameters in collagen extracted from skin punch-biopsies: pentosidine and fluorescence at 370\/440nm, as markers and predictors of microvascular complications, in 30 patients with diabetes (14 type-1, 16 type-2) without renal insufficiency, and in age- and gender-matched normoglycemic controls, followed at Hôtel-Dieu in Paris.\nRESULTS: At the time of biopsy, marked increases in pentosidine (p=0.0014) and fluorescence (p=0.0001) expressed per collagen hydroxyproline, were found in the patients with diabetes versus the controls. A significant effect of age was found for pentosidine, but not fluorescence, measurements in the normoglycemic controls. Therefore pentosidine but not fluorescence results were corrected for age in the patients. Pentosidine and fluorescence were correlated with diabetes duration. Fluorescence was significantly dependent on retinopathy presence and score in type-1 and type-2 diabetes, whereas pentosidine was not. Fluorescence was correlated with microalbuminuria only in type-1 diabetes. Neither fluorescence nor pentosidine were correlated with creatininemia. Already six years after biopsy, retinopathy score progression and creatininemia increase were significantly correlated with initial pentosidine and fluorescence measurements.\nCONCLUSIONS: These AGEs are good predictors of progression of microvascular complications and appear to be pathogenic. High skin concentrations of AGEs should induce tighter anti-diabetic treatment.",

        "Abstract":"AIM: Lupus nephritis (LN) is an important complication of systemic lupus erythematosus (SLE). The aim is to use indication and protocol biopsies to determine clinicopathological findings and outcomes of patients with LN undergoing kidney transplantation (KTx).\nMETHODS: Patients who underwent KTx due to LN were retrospectively analyzed. Recurrent LN (RLN) was diagnosed by transplant kidney biopsy.\nRESULTS: Among 955 KTx patients, 12 patients with LN as the cause of end-stage renal disease were enrolled. Five patients were male. Mean follow-up time was 63 ± 34 months. At the last follow-up visit, mean levels of serum creatinine and proteinuria were 137.0 ± 69.0 µmol\/L and 0.26 ± 0.26 g\/day, respectively. Eighteen indication and 22 protocol biopsies were performed; 27 biopsies were additionally evaluated by immunofluorescence. In two recipients, subclinical RLN was confirmed by protocol biopsies. Clinical recurrence occurred in four patients. Among patients with RLN, time from diagnosis of LN to KTx was significantly shorter and use of ATG as induction treatment was significantly lower. Graft loss occurred in two recipients who had clinical RLN. Five-year overall graft survival was 85.7%.\nCONCLUSION: Kidney transplantation is a reasonable option for patients with ESRD secondary to SLE. However, recurrence of LN is common if protocol biopsies are included in post-transplantation surveillance.",

Athough widely used and without question of pivotal importance for the diagnosis of renal diseases, little systematic data regarding standardized indications, outcomes, or consequences for this procedure are available. The aim of this study was to compare the clinically suspected diagnosis with the morphological results and the potential impact of PRB on the treatment of the patient.\nMETHODS: 205 patients who underwent PRB of the native kidney within a 4-year period were included in this retrospective analysis. The biopsy results (BR), discharge diagnosis (DD), and the suspected diagnoses (SD) of the attending nephrologists prior to biopsy were documented.\nRESULTS: Mean age of the patients was 58 (range 44 - 77) years. The majority of patients (61%) received PRB during an acute disease phase, whereas 39% had elective PRB. Percutaneous biopsy of the native kidney led to a discharge diagnosis in 92% of the patients, with low complication rates (with 3 out of 205 patients had major bleeding complications). In ~ 2\/3, the nephrologists were correct with the suspected diagnosis prior to the biopsy. In ~ 74% of the biopsies, a disease was identified that was potentially responsive to treatment modification.\nCONCLUSIONS: In summary, PRB was found to be a safe procedure that confirmed the suspected clinical diagnosis in two thirds of patients. As one third of the histopathological analyses demonstrated a non-suspected disease, the biopsies were of major importance for the correct treatment of the patients.",

This study also found that many of these factors have different relationships with sleep disturbance when comparing pre- and post-kidney transplant patients.\nCONCLUSIONS: These results suggest that such factors may be worthwhile areas for intervention in treating the symptoms of insomnia among pre- and post-transplant recipients.

We assessed prognostic implications of changes in histology first 2 years posttransplant in 938 first kidney recipients, transplanted 1999-2010, followed for 93.4 ± 37.7 months. Compared to implantation biopsies, histology changed posttransplant showing at 1 year that 72.6% of grafts had minor abnormalities (favorable histology), 20.2% unfavorable histology, and 7.2% glomerulonephritis. Compared to favorable, graft survival was reduced in recipients with unfavorable histology (hazards ratio [HR] = 4.79 [3.27-7.00], p < 0.0001) or glomerulonephritis (HR = 5.91 [3.17-11.0], p < 0.0001). Compared to unfavorable, in grafts with favorable histology, failure was most commonly due to death (42% vs. 70%, p < 0.0001) and less commonly due to alloimmune causes (27% vs. 10%, p < 0.0001). In 80% of cases, favorable histology persisted at 2 years. However, de novo 2-year unfavorable histology (15.3%) or glomerulonephritis (4.7%) related to reduced survival. The proportion of favorable grafts increased during this period (odds ratio = 0.920 [0.871-0.972], p = 0.003, per year) related to fewer DGF, rejections, polyoma-associated nephropathy (PVAN), and better function. Graft survival also improved (HR = 0.718 [0.550-0.937], p = 0.015) related to better histology and function. Evolution of graft histologic early posttransplant relate to long-term survival.

Early diagnosis of treatable non-diabetic diseases in diabetic patients is important to ameliorate renal prognosis. The publication of the International Consensus Document for the classification of type 1 and type 2 diabetes has provided common criteria for the classification of diabetic nephropathy and its utility to stratify risk for renal failure has already been demonstrated in different retrospective studies.

When carrying out our retrospective analysis comparing the two different formulations, we evaluated several clinical results: tacrolimus trough concentrations (C0) at 5-7 days; 1, 3, and 6 months post-transplantation; concentration\/dose ratio at 6 months; acute rejection incidence; delayed graft function (DGF); renal function (as CKD-EPI); and proteinuria at 6 months in 120 patients (1:1 ratio of Prograf(®) versus Adoport(®) ), noticing no important differences. We also evaluated the results of protocol biopsies at 6 months in a subgroup of patients, thus verifying the safety and efficacy of this particular generic drug versus the reference product on a histological basis as well.

Immunohistochemical staining for C4d, CD56 and CD163 was performed.\nRESULTS: One hundred and seventy four indication biopsies were divided into early (≤1 year posttransplant; n = 49) and late (>1 year posttransplant; n = 125) biopsies. High numbers of CD56+ cells were uncommon in early biopsies except for those with antibody-mediated rejection (AMR) only. On the other hand, high numbers of CD56+ cells were observed in late biopsies diagnosed as TCMR only, AMR only, and TCMR combined with AMR. In early biopsies, both CD56+ and CD163+ infiltrates correlated strongly with interstitial inflammation, tubulitis, and peritubular capillaritis (ptc) scores. The ci and ct scores, however, were correlated only with the number of CD56+ cells. In late biopsies, on the other hand, the number of CD56+ infiltrates was correlated only with ptc, while the number of CD163+ infiltrates was weakly correlated with any histologic lesion. Multivariable analyses showed that chronic active AMR and the number of CD56+ cells\/10 HPF were independently associated with death-censored graft failure post-biopsy. The number of CD163+ cells was not correlated with any pathologic lesion and post-biopsy graft failure. CD56+ infiltrates were also associated with interstitial fibrosis and tubular atrophy.\nCONCLUSIONS: Intragraft CD56+ cell infiltrates were significantly associated with AMR and subsequent poor clinical outcomes.",

        "Abstract":"BACKGROUND: The renal resistive index (RI) is a Doppler-derived measure that reportedly correlates with renal histological changes and renal disease severity and outcome. The aim of this study was to investigate the factors related to the RI elevation in chronic kidney disease (CKD).\nMETHODS: Using Doppler ultrasonography, RIs were determined in 30 patients with CKD, after which they were correlated with interstitial fibrosis, arteriosclerosis, arteriolosclerosis and peritubular capillary (PTC) density. PTC-positive areas were determined based on CD34 immunostaining. Interstitial fibrosis was detected with Masson trichrome staining. All histological markers were assessed using quantitative and semi-quantitative analyses and evaluated statistically using Pearson correlation tests, unpaired t tests and stepwise multiple regression analysis.\nRESULTS: RI correlated positively with age (r = 0.603, p = 0.0004), systolic blood pressure (r = 0.775, p < 0.0001), diastolic blood pressure (r = 0.575, p = 0.001), interstitial fibrosis (r = 0.381, p = 0.038) and arteriosclerosis (r = 0.520, p = 0.003), and negatively with creatinine clearance (r = -0.471, p = 0.009) and CD34+ (PTC) areas (r = -0.437, p = 0.016). Patients with hypertension or diabetes mellitus showed higher RIs (p < 0.05) than those without the ailments. Multivariate analysis showed PTC and arteriosclerosis to be independent variables correlating with RI (r (2) = 0.321, p < 0.05).\nCONCLUSIONS: To our knowledge, this is the first report of using RI measurements to evaluate peritubular capillary loss. Our findings indicate that increases in RI are associated with both arteriosclerosis and loss of PTCs.",

Renal graft biopsy is safe and reliable without adverse effects on the patients and transplanted kidneys, which was of great instructive significance in diagnosis and treatment of renal allograft dysfunction after renal transplantation. This paper reported a case series of 106 patients underwent renal allograft biopsies. All biopsies were evaluated according to the Banff 2007 schema. 52 examples were obtained within 1 month after transplantation, and there were another 20 examples in one to two months and other 34 examples in two to three months. Appropriate therapy was applied and clinical outcomes were observed. All patients received renal biopsies and anti-inflammatory and hemostasis treatment without complications. There were 2 cases of hyperacute rejection, and 15 cases of acute AMR. All Paraffin-embedded samples were stained by HE, periodic acid-Schiff (PAS), Masson, and immunohistochemistry (C4d, cd20, cd45RO, SV40). All samples were found C4d immunohistochemical staining positive. Patients with acute AMR were managed by steroid intravenous pulse therapy, Rabbit anti-thymocyte globulin intravenous pulse therapy, anti CD20 monoclonal antibody intravenous therapy and so on. Two cases of hyperacute rejection had renal failure, and received kidney excision; 12 cases in 15 cases of AMR recovered, another 2 cases did not recover with high-level creatine, and other 2 cases of renal allograft received excision.",

The histological localization of these amyloid deposits determines the overall survival of the patient.\nMETHODS: In this study we have assessed the histological localization and severity of amyloid deposition in 35 patients with biopsy-proven renal amyloidosis and have compared those to clinical parameters, histo-pathological injury criteria and respective patient outcome. Comparisons were statistically analyzed using thus comparison between the different study groups, which was done using Student t-test and analysis of variance.\nRESULTS: We find that the glomerulus is by far the most commonly and most severely affected renal compartment and patients with severe glomerular amyloidosis advance faster towards end stage renal disease (ESRD) and death, compared to those patients without glomerular amyloid deposits. Patients with severe glomerular amyloidosis showed higher serum creatinine and urine protein levels, while patients with severe vascular amyloidosis showed higher levels of interstitial inflammatory infiltrate.\nCONCLUSION: In kidneys affected by amyloidosis, the amyloid proteins are predominantly deposited along vessels, especially the small vessels including glomerular capillary loops. The severity of glomerular amyloid deposition enhances the risk of developing ESRD and increases the risk for premature death.",

Bone marrow biopsy may be indicated to evaluate these complications. However, to the best of our knowledge, no previous study has systematically documented the characteristics of bone marrow biopsy in these patients. The present study reports the range of bone marrow findings in renal transplant recipients.\nMATERIALS AND METHODS: We selected 85 patients who underwent bone marrow biopsy among 1745 renal transplant recipients who had transplant at Ba şkent University from January 1990 to December 2013. The files of these patients were reviewed for age, sex, age at renal transplant, underlying renal disease, donor type, immunosuppressive therapy, presence or absence of acute humoral or cellular rejection, duration between transplant and bone marrow biopsy, indication for bone marrow biopsy, and histopathologic diagnoses of bone marrow biopsies.\nRESULTS: The most common cause of renal insufficiency leading to transplant in this patient group was unknown etiology, observed in 24 patients (28.2%). The most common indication for bone marrow biopsy was blood cytopenia, detected in 56 patients (65.9%). Neoplastic involvement of the bone marrow was detected in 6 patients (7.1%), all of which were hematolymphoid malignancies. Corticosteroids were the most commonly used immunosuppressive agents, administered to all patients.\nCONCLUSIONS: Bone marrow biopsy provides important information in renal transplant recipients, especially in cases of neoplastic bone marrow involvement, specific inflammation, and amyloidosis, which are uncommon in this patient group.

        "Abstract":"BACKGROUND: Global glomerulosclerosis is characteristic of chronic kidney disease and also occurs with normal aging. Our goal was to determine the upper limit of normal for number of globally sclerotic glomeruli.\nMETHODS: Core-needle biopsies of the renal cortex were obtained at the time of living kidney transplantation at three centers between 1998 and 2011. The number of globally sclerotic glomeruli was averaged across two biopsy sections. Quantile regression was used to estimate the 95th percentile for globally sclerotic glomeruli as the upper reference limit. There were 2052 donors (mean age 43 years, 41% male, 10% hypertensive), with a mean (SD) of 16.0 (9.7) glomeruli and 0.47 (0.99) globally sclerotic glomeruli on biopsy; only 2.6% had >5% fibrosis.\nRESULTS: In a multivariable model excluding hypertensive donors, independent predictors of the number of globally sclerotic glomeruli were age, total number of glomeruli and cortex area. A simplified model was used to estimate the 95th percentile for number of globally sclerotic glomeruli by total number of glomeruli and age. For a biopsy section with 17-32 total glomeruli, the 95th percentile ranged from 1 for a 20-year old to 5.5 for a 70-year old donor. Hypertensive donors were more likely to have an abnormal number of globally sclerotic glomeruli (OR = 1.79, P = 0.035).\nCONCLUSIONS: We have derived the 95% reference limit for number of globally sclerotic glomeruli in ostensibly healthy individuals accounting for age and the biopsy characteristics. Numbers of globally sclerotic glomeruli in a kidney biopsy that exceed these thresholds suggest chronic pathological injury in excess of that expected with normal aging.",

        "Abstract":"OBJECTIVES: Liver biopsy is performed for various indications in dialysis patients. Being a less-common subset, the hepatic pathology in renal dialysis is not well documented. Idiopathic noncirrhotic portal hypertension (INCPH) is a clinical entity associated with unexplained portal hypertension and\/or a spectrum of histopathological vascular changes in the liver. After encountering INCPH and vascular changes of INCPH in 2 renal dialysis patients, we sought to further investigate this noteworthy association.\nMATERIALS AND METHODS: A random search for patients on hemodialysis or peritoneal dialysis with liver biopsy was performed. Hematoxylin and eosin, reticulin, trichrome, and CK7 stains were performed on formalin-fixed, paraffin-embedded tissue sections. Histopathological features were reviewed, and the results were correlated with clinical findings.\nRESULTS: In all, 13 liver biopsies were retrieved. The mean cumulative duration of dialysis was 50 months (range = 17 months to 11 years). All patients had multiple comorbidities. Indications for biopsy were a combination of abnormal liver function tests (6), portal hypertension (4), ascites (3), and possible cirrhosis (3). Two patients with portal hypertension underwent multiple liver biopsies for diagnostic purposes. All (100%) biopsies showed some histological features of INCPH, including narrowed portal venous lumen (9), increased portal vascular channels (8), shunt vessels (3), dilated sinusoids (9), regenerative nodule (5), and features of venous outflow obstruction (3). No cirrhosis was identified.\nCONCLUSION: Liver biopsies from patients on dialysis demonstrate histopathological vascular changes of INCPH. Some (31%) patients present with portal hypertension without cirrhosis. The histological changes may be reflective of underlying risk factors for INCPH in this group.",

        "Published":null,
        "Abstract":"In this article, the benefits of urinary proteomics in comparison with kidney biopsy are discussed. The majority of urinary proteins are generated by the kidney, hence the urinary proteome holds substantial information on the kidney, and assessment of the urinary proteome could be considered a 'liquid biopsy'. The main question is how well the information contained in the urinary proteome can be assessed today, if it is ready to be routinely used, and what are the advantages and possible disadvantages in comparison with current standards. Since chronic kidney disease (CKD) is by far the largest area in nephrology based on the number of patients affected, the focus of this article is on CKD. Substantial progress was made in the last decade in urinary proteomics, and today we have comparable urinary proteome datasets of tens of thousands of subjects available. Clinical proteomics studies in CKD including close to, or even exceeding, 1000 subjects have recently been published, demonstrating a benefit over the current state-of-the-art in diagnosis and especially prognosis. The first large multicentric randomized controlled intervention trial aiming at preventing CKD by employing urinary proteomics-guided intervention has been initiated recently. These data provide ample evidence for the utility and value of urinary proteomics in nephrology. A further consideration is that the purpose of the biopsy, be it 'liquid' or 'solid', is to guide intervention. However, essentially all drug targets are proteins, not microscopic structures. Therefore, obtaining information on the proteome to guide intervention appears to be the most appropriate approach. Presenting more detailed evidence, I argue that urinary proteome analysis can, in most cases, be employed to guide therapeutic intervention, can be repeated multiple times as it is without any direct risk or discomfort and can be considered as a liquid biopsy.",

Kidney biopsy findings often play a role in these discards, although it is not clear whether biopsies reliably inform acceptance decisions. Therefore, we carried out a systematic review of the medical literature on the utility of both procurement and implantation biopsies for predicting posttransplant outcomes. Between January 1, 1994 and July 1, 2014, 47 studies were published in the English language literature that examined the association between pretransplant donor biopsy findings from 50 or more donors (with more than half being from deceased donors) and either posttransplant graft failure, delayed graft function, or graft function. In general, study quality was poor. All were retrospective or did not indicate if they were prospective. Results were heterogeneous, with authors as often as not concluding that biopsy results did not predict posttransplant outcomes. The percent glomerular sclerosis was most often examined, and failed to predict graft failure in 7 of 14 studies. Of 15 semiquantitative scoring systems proposed, none consistently predicted posttransplant outcomes across studies. Routine use of biopsies to help determine whether or not to transplant a kidney should be reexamined.",

However, the significance of the nephron number estimated from a renal biopsy in patients with hypertensive nephrosclerosis (HNS) has not yet been elucidated.\nMETHODS: In this cross-sectional study, we examined the clinicopathological findings of biopsy-proven HNS patients with preserved renal function (estimated glomerular filtration rate ≥ 60 ml\/min\/1.73 m(2)). The glomerular density (GD; the number of glomeruli per total renal cortical area) in biopsy specimens was evaluated as a surrogate of the nephron number. Renal biopsies from kidney transplant donors were used as healthy controls.\nRESULTS: A total of 58 HNS patients were enrolled. The GD value in the HNS patients was low compared with those in the kidney transplant donors (2.0 vs. 3.2 \/mm(2)). These differences remained significant when globally sclerotic glomeruli were included in the calculation of the GD. Of note, the GD in HNS patients with overt proteinuria (≥1 g\/day) was significantly lower than that of HNS patients with mild proteinuria (<1g\/day; 1.8 vs. 2.2\/mm(2), P = 0.014). In contrast, other histopathological parameters, including the severity of global glomerulosclerosis, interstitial fibrosis\/tubular atrophy and arterial and arteriole lesions were comparable between the 2 HNS subgroups. In addition, the GD was identified as a factor that was associated with the amount of urinary protein excretion at biopsy, independent of other clinicopathological factors.\nCONCLUSIONS: These results suggest that a low GD is a renal histological characteristic of HNS patients, especially those with overt proteinuria.",

Reversal of renal pathological lesions was evaluated between the first and second biopsy. The end-point was defined as a 30% reduction in estimated glomerular filtration rate (eGFR) or end-stage renal disease after the second biopsy.\nRESULTS: Active glomerular lesions, i.e. endocapillary hypercellularity (E), crescents (C) and necrosis (N) were markedly decreased at the second biopsy after immunosuppressive therapy (36.7 vs. 8.3%, p < 0.001; 85.0 vs. 25.0%, p < 0.001; and 51.7 vs. 3.3%, p < 0.001). Patients with E, C or N at the first biopsy but reversed at the second biopsy showed significantly decreased median levels of proteinuria and hematuria. Such clinical changes were not observed in those with active lesions at both biopsies. After a median follow-up of 32 months, 25.0% of patients reached the end-point. Repeat biopsy confirmed that only tubular atrophy\/interstitial fibrosis was associated with the renal outcome.\nCONCLUSIONS: Active glomerular lesions can be reversed by immunosuppressive treatment in patients with IgAN. The reversal is accompanied by improvement in proteinuria and hematuria. The reversal of these lesions during the disease process may explain the lack of significant correlation of these lesions with clinical outcomes in the present study as well as in previous evaluation studies of the Oxford classification of IgAN.",

Similarly, the addition of IFTA score resulted in a significantly greater net reclassification improvement and integrated discrimination improvement than the model with proteinuria alone [NRI: 0.78 (95% CI: 0.43-1.13; p < 0.001), IDI: 0.13 (95% CI: 0.07-0.19; p < 0.001)].\nCONCLUSIONS: Our results suggest that not only proteinuria but also tubulointerstitial lesions should be assessed to predict rapid eGFR decline in patients with type 2 diabetes who have overt proteinuria and biopsy-proven diabetic nephropathy.",

        "Abstract":"In chronic kidney disease the excessive production of parathyroid hormone increases the bone resorption rate and leads to histologic bone signs of secondary hyperparathyroidism. However, in other situations, the initial increase in parathyroid hormone and bone remodeling may be slowed down excessively by a multitude of factors including age, ethnic origin, sex, and treatments such as vitamin D, calcium salts, calcimimetics, steroids, and so forth, leading to low bone turnover or adynamic bone disease. Both high and low bone turnover diseases actually are observed equally in chronic kidney disease patients treated by dialysis, and all types of renal osteodystrophy are associated with an increased risk of skeletal fractures, reduced quality of life, and poor clinical outcomes. Unfortunately, the diagnosis of these bone abnormalities cannot be obtained correctly by current clinical, biochemical, and imaging methods. Therefore, bone biopsy has been, and still remains, the gold standard analysis for assessing the exact type of renal osteodystrophy. It is also the unique way to assess the mechanisms of action, safety, and efficacy of new bone-targeting therapies.",

        "Published":null,
        "Abstract":"INTRODUCTION: Renal transplantation is the best treatment for end-stage renal disease, including when using expanded criteria donors (ECD) kidneys. However, these suboptimal kidneys should be evaluated rigorously to meet their usefulness. Opinions differ about the best way to evaluate them.\nMATERIALS AND METHODS: We retrospectively reviewed kidneys from ECD harvested by a single academic institution between January 2008 and September 2013. Needle biopsies were performed at the time of the harvest when considered relevant by the transplant team. Two pathologists where responsible for their analysis; the Remuzzi classification has been used in all cases.\nRESULTS: We evaluated 560 ECD kidneys. Biopsies were made in 197 (35.2%) organs, 20 of which were considered not usable and 36 good only for double transplantation. Sixty-three kidneys (11.3%) were discarded by the transplant team based on the biopsy result and clinical criteria. Donors who underwent a biopsy were older (P < .001) and had a worse glomerular filtration rate (GFR; P = .001). Comparing donors approved and rejected by the biopsy, the rejected donors were heavier (P = .003) and had a lower GFR (P = .002). Cold ischemia time was longer for the biopsy group (P < .001). Regarding graft function, the biopsy overall score correlated with the transplant outcome in the short and long term. Separately, glomeruli and interstitium scores were correlated with recipient's GFR in the earlier periods (3 months; P = .025 and .037), and the arteries and tubules correlated with GFR in the longer term (at 3 years P = .004 and .010).\nCONCLUSION: The decision on the usability of ECD grafts is complex. At our center, we chose a mixed approach based on donor risk. Low-risk ECD do not require biopsy. In more complex situations, especially older donors or those with a lower GFR, prompted a pretransplant biopsy. The biopsy results proved to be useful as they relate to subsequent transplant outcomes, thereby allowing us to exclude grafts whose function would most probably be less than optimal.",

        "Published":"2014-11-11",
        "Abstract":"The attrition rate of functioning allografts beyond the first year has not improved despite improved immunosuppression, suggesting that nonimmune mechanisms could be involved. Notably, glomerulopathies may account for about 40% of failed kidney allografts beyond the first year of engraftment, and glomerulosclerosis and progression to ESRD are caused by podocyte depletion. Model systems demonstrate that nephrectomy can precipitate hypertrophic podocyte stress that triggers progressive podocyte depletion leading to ESRD, and that this process is accompanied by accelerated podocyte detachment that can be measured in urine. Here, we show that kidney transplantation \"reverse nephrectomy\" is also associated with podocyte hypertrophy and increased podocyte detachment. Patients with stable normal allograft function and no proteinuria had levels of podocyte detachment similar to levels in two-kidney controls as measured by urine podocyte assay. By contrast, patients who developed transplant glomerulopathy had 10- to 20-fold increased levels of podocyte detachment. Morphometric studies showed that a subset of these patients developed reduced glomerular podocyte density within 2 years of transplantation due to reduced podocyte number per glomerulus. A second subset developed glomerulopathy by an average of 10 years after transplantation due to reduced glomerular podocyte number and glomerular tuft enlargement. Reduced podocyte density was associated with reduced eGFR, glomerulosclerosis, and proteinuria. These data are compatible with the hypothesis that podocyte depletion contributes to allograft failure and reduced allograft half-life. Mechanisms may include immune-driven processes affecting the podocyte or other cells and\/or hypertrophy-induced podocyte stress causing accelerated podocyte detachment, which would be amenable to nonimmune therapeutic targeting.",

Data involving prevalence of alterations in bone histological patterns, impact of different treatments and its repercussion in outcomes, such as bone fractures, hospitalization, cardiovascular disease and mortality, are scarce. Data bank registry can be a valuable tool to understand epidemiological aspects of MBD CKD. The Brazilian Registry of Bone Biopsy (REBRABO) will be a national registry, coordinating by the Brazilian Society of Nephrology - Committee of MBD-CKD.\nOBJECTIVE: To describe REBRABO's design, elements of data and methodology.\nMETHODS: Will be an online national observational and multicentric data registry divided in two phases (retrospective, 1st phase) and prospective (2nd phase), including information from bone tissue histomorphometric analysis and demographics, clinical and laboratorial data from CKD-MBD patients.\nRESULTS: The REBRABO's first phase will explore data on demographics, clinical, laboratorial and bone histomorphometric analysis data from January\/1986 to December\/2013. The first RESULTS are expected in early 2015.\nCONCLUSION: Studies in the field of CKD-MBD are needed, particularly those analyzing its prevalence, associations between demographic, clinical, histological parameters, and major outcomes.

FNAC showed dense amorphous clumps of extracellular material which appeared magenta colored on Giemsa and eosinophilic on Papanicolaou stain. Congo red staining and polarization showed characteristic apple green birefringence, thus confirming the material as amyloid, and the diagnosis of amyloid goiter was made.\nCONCLUSION: Amyloid on FNAC smears can be easily mistaken for colloid, and correct interpretation can avoid a false diagnosis of colloid goiter.

In the present study we assessed the clinical spectrum of patients with drug-associated cutaneous vasculitis (DACV).\nMETHODS: Case records were reviewed of patients with DACV treated at a tertiary referral hospital over a 36-year period. A diagnosis of DACV was considered if the drug was taken within a week before the onset of the disease.\nRESULTS: From a series of 773 unselected cutaneous vasculitis cases, 239 patients (30.9%; 133 men and 106 women; mean age 36 yrs) were diagnosed with DACV. Antibiotics (n=149; 62.3%), mainly β-lactams and nonsteroidal antiinflammatory drugs (NSAID; n=24; 10%) were the most common drugs. Besides skin lesions (100%), the most common clinical features were joint (51%) and gastrointestinal (38.1%) manifestations, nephropathy (34.7%), and fever (23.8%). The most remarkable laboratory data were increased erythrocyte sedimentation rate (40.2%), presence of serum cryoglobulins (26%), leukocytosis (24.7%), positive antinuclear antibodies (21.1%), anemia (18.8%), and positive rheumatoid factor (17.5%). Despite drug discontinuation and bed rest, 108 patients (45.2%) required medical treatment, mainly corticosteroids (n=71) or immunosuppressive drugs (n=7). After a median followup of 5 months, relapses occurred in 18.4% of patients, and persistent microhematuria or renal insufficiency in 3.3% and 5%, respectively.\nCONCLUSION: DACV is generally associated with antibiotics and NSAID. In most cases it has a favorable prognosis, although a small percentage of patients may develop residual renal damage.",

In this study, the safety and efficacy of PRB is investigated, and also the common etiologies of childhood kidney disease, based on histological findings. In addition, we explored the role of PRBs in the diagnosis of children who presented with persistent asymptomatic hematuria.\nMETHODS: By chart review, from July 2005 to July 2009, a total of 99 PRBs were performed on 91 children (43 girls and 48 boys; mean age, 10.9 ± 4.4 years) under ultrasound (US) guidance, by a doctor, using an automated 18-gauge biopsy needle following the same protocol, at a medical center in northern Taiwan.\nRESULTS: The accuracy of the histological diagnosis was excellent. The most common post-biopsy complications were perirenal hematoma (11.1%) and asymptomatic gross hematuria (3.0%), respectively. Nevertheless, these complications resolved spontaneously, and none had major bleeding episodes. Histological results showed that lupus nephritis, minimal change disease, and IgA nephropathy (IgAN) could be the current leading causes of childhood kidney diseases in Taiwan.\nCONCLUSIONS: Automated ultrasound (US)-guided PRB is a safe and reliable method of assessing childhood renal disease. A recent study shows that the presence of persistent asymptomatic isolated microhematuria in adolescents is a predictive marker of future end-stage renal disease. Hence, the emphasis of renal biopsy on children with persistent asymptomatic hematuria is beneficial for the early diagnosis of IgAN or other glomerulonephritis (GN), which tends toward progressive kidney disease in adulthood without prompt therapeutic intervention.",

The role of histopathological alterations in kidney compartments as a prognostic factor in graft survival and function has had conflicting results.\nOBJECTIVE: This study evaluated the prevalence of chronic alterations in pre-implant biopsies of kidney grafts and the association of findings with graft function and survival in one year post-transplant.\nMETHODS: 110 biopsies were analyzed between 2006 and 2009 at Santa Casa de Porto Alegre, including live donors, ideal deceased donors and those with expanded criteria. The score was computed according to criteria suggested by Remuzzi. The glomerular filtration rate (GFR) was calculated using the abbreviated MDRD formula.\nRESULTS: No statistical difference was found in the survival of donors stratified according to Remuzzi criteria. The GFR was significantly associated with the total scores in the groups with mild and moderate alterations, and in the kidney compartments alone, by univariate analysis. The multivariate model found an association with the presence of arteriosclerosis, glomerulosclerosis, acute rejection and delayed graft function.\nCONCLUSION: Pre-transplant chronic kidney alterations did not influence the post-transplantation one-year graft survival, but arteriosclerosis and glomerulosclerosis is predictive of a worse GFR. Delayed graft function and acute rejection are independent prognostic factors.",

        "Abstract":"BACKGROUND: Nephrotic syndrome (NS) presenting early in life is caused by heterogeneous glomerular diseases. We retrospectively evaluated whether histological diagnosis in children presenting with NS in the first year of life predicts remission or progression to end-stage kidney disease (ESKD).\nMETHODS: This is a single centre retrospective review of all children diagnosed with NS before one year of age between 1990 and 2009. All subjects had a renal biopsy, which was independently blindly reviewed by a single renal pathologist for the purpose of this study.\nRESULTS: Forty-nine children (25 female) who presented at 0.1-11.6 (median 1.6) months were included with 31 presenting within the first three months of life. Histopathological review diagnostic categories were; 13 Mesangial proliferative glomerulopathy (MesGN), 12 Focal and segmental glomerulosclerosis (FSGS), 11 Finnish type changes, eight Diffuse Mesangial Sclerosis (DMS), three Minimal change disease (MCD) and one each of Dense Deposit Disease (DDD) and Membranous nephropathy. Two children died from haemorrhagic complications of the biopsy. Eight children achieved remission (four MesGN, one Finnish type changes, one FSGS, one MCD and one membranous) with patient and renal survival of 73 % and 43 %, respectively, at follow-up duration of 5-222 (median 73) months (with five lost to follow-up). All children with Finnish-type histopathological changes presented within five months of age. Due to the historical nature of the cohort, genetic testing was only available for 14 children, nine of whom had an identifiable genetic basis (seven NPHS1, one PLCE1 and one ITGA3) with none of these nine children achieving remission. All of them had presented within four months of age and required renal replacement therapy, and two died.\nCONCLUSIONS: Histopathological findings are varied in children presenting with NS early in life. Whilst groups of histological patterns of disease are associated with differing outcomes, accurate prediction of disease course in a specific case is difficult and more widespread genetic testing may improve the understanding of this group of diseases and their optimal management.",

        "Abstract":"BACKGROUND: Although hemorrhagic complications are major complications of percutaneous renal biopsy (PRB), the relationship between procedure volume and morbidity remains unclear for PRB. The present study investigated the impact of hospital volume on the occurrence of hemorrhagic complications after PRB.\nMETHODS: Using large claims-based data in the diagnosis procedure combination database in Japan, we identified inpatients with renal disorders who underwent PRB within 4 days after admission during July to December 2007 to 2010. We assessed patient age, sex, clinical syndromes, hemorrhagic complications and diagnoses, and annual hospital volume of PRB divided into quintiles. Multivariate logistic regression analyses fitted with a generalized estimation equation were performed accounting for within-hospital clustering.\nRESULTS: A total of 15,191 patients were identified from 942 hospitals. The overall proportion of hemorrhagic complications was 2.1 %, including diagnoses of hemorrhagic events (1.6 %), red blood cell transfusion (0.5 %), and requiring angiography or endovascular procedure (0.1 %). In-hospital deaths attributable to the complications occurred in 0.06 % of the patients. Patients with rapidly progressive nephritic syndrome (odds ratio 3.41, 95 % confidence interval 2.22-5.25) had significantly higher incidence than those with chronic nephritic syndrome. No significant association was observed between hospital volume and hemorrhagic complications, with odds ratios for the low-intermediate, intermediate, intermediate-high, and high-volume groups relative to the low-volume group of 0.74 (0.43-1.26), 1.19 (0.74-1.92), 1.16 (0.67-2.00), and 1.35 (0.78-2.34), respectively.\nCONCLUSIONS: No significant relationship was observed between hemorrhagic complication incidence and hospital volume regarding PRB.",

        "Abstract":"PURPOSE OF REVIEW: Chronic kidney disease-mineral and bone disorder (CKD-MBD) is a complex disorder of bone and mineral metabolism that results in an excess risk of fractures, cardiovascular events and mortality. The management of the bone disorder aspect of CKD-MBD may require bone biopsy to determine appropriate treatment strategies. However, it is unclear when biopsy may be necessary and whether or not state-of-the art imaging and serologic testing can supplant the bone biopsy as a tool to assist with management decisions.\nRECENT FINDINGS: Advances in imaging methods now permit the noninvasive assessment of structural aspects of bone quality. Furthermore, common bone imaging tools, such as dual-energy X-ray absorptiometry, can be used to stratify for fracture risk. Circulating markers of bone turnover can be used to assess the risk of bone loss and fracture, but they are less useful in diagnosing the type of renal osteodystrophy.\nSUMMARY: Although advances in imaging now permit the assessment of fracture risk more accurately in CKD patients, the assessment of the type of renal osteodystrophy remains poor without bone biopsy. The virtual bone biopsy will be possible only when we are able to noninvasively assess turnover with good accuracy. A bone biopsy is needed when the bone turnover is unclear.",

        "Abstract":"Imaging plays a role in the management of patients with acute kidney injury or chronic kidney disease. However, clinical circumstances strongly impact the appropriateness of imaging use. In patients with newly detected renal dysfunction, ultrasonography can assess for reversible causes, assess renal size and echogenicity, and thus, establish the chronicity of disease. Urinary obstruction can be detected, but imaging is most useful in high-risk groups or in patients in whom there is a strong clinical suspicion for obstruction. Computed tomography, computed tomography or magnetic resonance arteriography, and percutaneous ultrasound-guided renal biopsy are valuable in other clinical situations. The American College of Radiology Appropriateness Criteria are evidence-based guidelines for specific clinical conditions that are reviewed every 3 years by a multidisciplinary expert panel. The guideline development and review include an extensive analysis of current medical literature from peer-reviewed journals and the application of a well-established consensus methodology (modified Delphi) to rate the appropriateness of imaging and treatment procedures by the panel.

        "Published":null,
        "Abstract":"Recurrence of native kidney disease following kidney transplantation affects between 10% and 20% of patients, and accounts for up to 8% of graft failures. In a considerable number of recipients with transplant glomerulopathy, it is impossible to distinguish between recurrent and de novo types. An accurate estimate of the incidence of recurrence is difficult due to limitations in the diagnosis of recurrent glomerulonephritis. De novo glomerular lesions may be misclassified if histological confirmation of the patient's native kidney disease is lacking. Asymptomatic histological recurrence in renal allografts may be missed if protocol biopsies are not available. Studies based on protocol biopsy are pivotal to accurately estimate the incidence of recurrence. Many factors are known to influence recurrence of kidney disease after transplantation, including the type and severity of the original disease, age at onset, interval from onset to end-stage renal disease, and clinical course of the previous transplantation. Early recognition of recurrence is possible in several glomerular diseases. Factors such as the existence of circulating permeability factors, circulating urokinase receptor and anti-phospholipase A2 receptor antibody, as well as disorders of complement regulatory proteins like factor I mutation and factor H mutation factors are expected to be useful predictors of recurrence. Peculiar clinical course of atypical haemolytic uremic syndrome after kidney transplantation is an informative sign of recurrent glomerular disease. These factors play pivotal roles in the development of recurrence of certain types of glomerulopathies. Understanding the pathogenesis of recurrent glomerulonephritis is critical to optimize prevention as well as treat individual cases of recurrent glomerulonephritis. Subclinical recurrence of IgA nephropathy after kidney transplantation is well recognized. Only protocol biopsies of clinically silent recipient can provide the accurate prevalence of recurrent IgA nephropathy. The study of recurrent glomerulonephritis will contribute not only to improving long-term graft survival, but also to clarifying the pathogenesis of glomerulonephritis. Protocol biopsy is one the most effective methods for elucidating the pathogenesis of recurrent glomerulonephritis.",

Among PGN, there was IgA nephropathy (IgAN, 37.0%), membranous nephropathy (MN, 11.8%), mesangial proliferative glomerulonephritis (MsPGN, 8.9%), minimal change disease (MCD, 6.6%), and focal segmental glomerulosclerosis (3.9%). Among SGN there was lupus nephritis (LN, 5.5%), Henoch-Schönlein purpura glomerulonephritis (5.3%), hepatitis B virus-associated nephritis (HBVAN, 3.03%), diabetic nephropathy (2.2%), and hypertension\/malignant hypertension-associated renal damage (1.9%). Pathological data were analyzed from 1987-1992 to 2008-2012 (after age adjustment). Detection rate of IgAN tended to rise (P < 0.001).

The most frequent biopsy-proven diseases were primary (55.7%) and secondary (29.1%) glomerulonephritides (GN). Tubulointerstitial nephritis (TIN) was observed in 3.4 % and vascular diseases in 4.1%. The samples were non-diagnostic in 4.2%. Among primary GN the most frequent diagnoses were IgA nephropathy (IgAN) (37.4%), membranous GN (MGN) (13%) and focal segmental glomerulosclerosis (FSGS) (12.6%).

Patient characteristics, the diagnosis of GN and its respective subtype and clinical symptoms such as arterial hypertension, haematuria, amount of proteinuria and estimated glomerular filtration rate (eGFR) were tested for their association with all-cause mortality and progression to end-stage renal disease (ESRD).\nRESULTS: During a median follow-up of 129·9 months (IQR 89·6; 177·7), 688 patients (25·6%) died and 718 patients required dialysis (29·4%). In multivariate Cox's regression analysis age (HR 1·06), female sex (HR 0·71), eGFR (HR 0·74), the diagnosis of GN and its subtypes predicted patient survival (all P < 0·01), whereas the amount of proteinuria was not associated with patient survival.

A retrospective review of clinical records and kidney biopsies was performed.\nRESULTS: There were 7 male and 3 female patients (median age at liver transplant, 43 y; range, 10 to 62 y). The most frequent reason for liver transplant were hepatitis B virus cirrhosis (4 patients). There were 3 patients who had a kidney transplant before or concurrent with liver transplant. Increased serum creatinine level was the most common clinical finding at the time of kidney biopsy. The median interval from liver transplant to kidney biopsy was 495 days (mean, 1025 d; range, 10-4980 d). The most common pathology in the kidney biopsies was immune complex glomerulonephritis (total, 7 patients: IgA nephropathy, 4 patients; lupus nephritis, 2 patients; membranoproliferative glomerulonephritis, 1 patient).

It is typically diagnosed by a biopsy of prominent skin lesions. Here, we report a 49-year-old man with end-stage renal disease on chronic peritoneal dialysis who presented with weakness, myalgias, and necrotic skin lesions. Multiple skin biopsies were nondiagnostic because of severe extensive necrosis, and the diagnosis of systemic calciphylaxis was eventually made by a muscle biopsy. This case demonstrates the significant muscle involvement in calciphylaxis and highlights the importance of maintaining a high clinical suspicion for patients with risk factors for calciphylaxis, even when skin biopsy does not confirm it.",

There remain no global guidelines available to the renal community on indications for this important diagnostic, prognostic, and relatively safe test. Although most nephrologists recognize several clear indications for a renal biopsy, it is still underutilized. It not only helps the clinician to manage the patient with CKD, but it can also help clarify the epidemiology of CKD, and aid research into the pathobiology of disease with the aim of discovering new therapies. It may be useful for instance in elderly patients with CKD, those with diabetes and presumed 'hypertensive nephropathy', and in some patients with advanced CKD as part of the pretransplant work-up. In some populations (for example, immunoglobulin A nephropathy and ANCA vasculitis), renal biopsy allows disease classification that may predict CKD progression and response to therapy. For the individual, interval renal biopsy may be of use in providing ongoing therapeutic and prognostic information. Molecular advances will change the landscape of renal pathology and add a new dimension to the diagnostic precision of kidney biopsy. Organizing the multiplicity of information available in a renal biopsy to maximize benefits to the patient, as well as to the epidemiologist and researcher, is one of the challenges that face the nephrology community.",

        "Abstract":"Diabetic nephropathy (DN) is one of the most important long-term complications of diabetes. Patients with diabetes and chronic kidney disease have an increased risk of all-cause mortality, cardiovascular mortality, and kidney failure. The clinical diagnosis of DN depends on the detection of microalbuminuria. This usually occurs after the first five years from the onset of diabetes, and predictors of DN development and progression are being studied but are not yet implemented into clinical practice. Diagnostic tests are useful tools to recognize onset, progression and response to therapeutic interventions. Microalbuminuria is an indicator of DN, and it is considered the only noninvasive marker of early onset. However, up to now there is no diagnostic tool that can predict which patients will develop DN before any damage is present. Pathological renal injury is hard to predict only with clinical and laboratory findings. An accurate estimate of damage in DN can only be achieved by the histological analysis of tissue samples. At the present time, renal biopsy is indicated on patients with diabetes under the suspicion of the presence of nephropathies other than DN. Results from renal biopsies in patients with diabetes had made possible the classification of renal biopsies in three major groups associated with different prognostic features: diabetic nephropathy, non-diabetic renal disease (NDRD), and a superimposed non-diabetic condition on underlying diabetic nephropathy. In patients with type 2 diabetes with a higher degree of suspicion for NDRD, it is granted the need of a renal biopsy. It is important to identify and differentiate these pathologies at an early stage in order to prevent progression and potential complications. Therefore, a more extensive use of biopsy is advisable.",

        "Abstract":"BACKGROUND: Previously, we have reported that flow cytometry analysis of fine-needle aspirates can accurately predict rejection in kidney transplants treated with cyclosporine-azathioprine-prednisolone. In this study, we examined this technique's accuracy using current immunosuppression.\nMETHODS: Kidney transplant recipients were treated with calcineurin inhibitors, mycophenolate mofetil, and prednisolone: 92 remained rejection-free - Group I - and 37 developed acute rejection - Group II. An allograft aspiration specimen and peripheral blood were collected from Group I on post-transplant day 7 and from Group II on the day of clinical rejection.\nRESULTS: Significant changes were seen in both aspiration and peripheral blood samples in several T cell subsets when comparing Groups I and II. A sensitivity of 94.6%, specificity of 85%, and AUC = 0.966 were observed through combining CD8DR with CD3CD69 values from aspiration specimen; the corresponding AUC in peripheral blood was 0.847. Irreversible rejections displayed a significantly higher activation score (p = 0.024).\nCONCLUSIONS: Flow cytometry analysis of aspiration specimen achieved high diagnostic performance in renal transplants through studying CD8DR and CD3CD69 under current immunosuppressive therapy. Peripheral blood analysis, although not significant, showed the same trend. The activation score anticipated the irreversibility of rejection. The data suggest this test, through an easily tolerated technique, merits further diagnostic use.",

        "Abstract":"BACKGROUND: Advanced fibrosis or cirrhosis is still regarded as a contraindication for kidney transplantation alone by most centers. The value of aminotransferase to platelet ratio index (APRI) and other non-invasive markers has been less studied in hepatitis C virus (HCV)-positive patients with concurrent end-stage renal disease to predict hepatic fibrosis. Can these be used to effectively decrease the number of biopsies done in these patients being evaluated for transplantation?\nMETHODS: Our study population included 255 patients with liver biopsy data. All patient information was collected and reviewed from medical records. The diagnostic accuracy of the predictive models was analyzed by calculating sensitivity, specificity, positive predictive value and negative predictive value.\nRESULTS: The variables associated with F3-F4 were aspartate aminotransferase (P = 0.007), bilirubin (P ≤ 0.001), platelet count (P = 0.01) and APRI (P ≤ 0.001). The use of any one laboratory abnormality to predict liver biopsy scores did not show high positive predictive values (22.6-72.7%). Having abnormal liver findings or cirrhosis on imaging was associated with high specificities (92.0-97.8%) but low sensitivities (31.4-42.9%). Using APRI levels of ≥0.40 and ≤0.95 as an indication for liver biopsy, 50% of patients with F3-F4 would have correctly avoided having a biopsy. However, 33% of patients with F3-F4 would have been mislabeled and not be indicated for biopsy.\nCONCLUSIONS: Our data suggest that there may not currently be a simple and sufficiently accurate non-invasive test to replace liver biopsy in renal transplant workup for HCV-positive patients. The risks outweigh the benefits when it comes to using non-invasive markers like the APRI.",

        "Abstract":"INTRODUCTION: Calciphylaxis, a rare obliterative small vessel vasculopathy associated with diabetes mellitus (DM), end-stage renal disease (ESRD), portends a poor prognosis. Because penile involvement is rare, agreement on appropriate diagnosis and management is unclear.\nAIM: To determine the role and effect of penile biopsy for diagnosis and management of penile calciphylaxis.\nMETHODS: Medical records of three penile calciphylaxis patients from our institution were evaluated. Data collected included age, history of DM, ESRD, and hemodialysis (HD) status, serum calcium (Ca), Ca × phosphorous product (C × P), parathyroid hormone (PTH), performance of biopsy, presence of non-penile cutaneous lesions, intervention, survival, and time from diagnosis to death. PubMed Search for relevant publications from 1995 to 2012 was performed to identify case reports of penile calciphylaxis that provided the same clinical data obtained from the 3 patients from our institution.\nMAIN OUTCOME MEASURES: Clinical evidence for outcomes in patients with penile calciphylaxis after biopsy of penile lesion compared to those without biopsy.\nRESULTS: A total of sixteen patients were identified in the literature and in our institution with clinical data of interest. Overall, 10\/16 (62.5%) patients identified with penile calciphylaxis had a penile biopsy, and 7\/10 (70%) experienced disease progression, while only 3\/10 (30%) stabilized. Mean time to death in this patient population was short, approximately 6.5 months, regardless of type of intervention.\nCONCLUSION: Based on the results of our study, we argue that conservative measures should be employed as first line therapy for penile calciphylaxis. More importantly, secondary to likely resultant progression of necrosis, penile biopsy is not only unnecessary for diagnosis of penile calciphylaxis, but is also harmful and contraindicated.",

In this study, we analyzed the results of kidney biopsy in liver transplantation recipients with renal impairment.\nMETHODS: Between 1999 and 2012, 544 liver transplants were performed at our hospital. We retrospectively analyzed the clinical and histological data of 10 liver transplantation recipients referred for kidney biopsy.\nRESULTS: The biopsies were performed at a median of 24.5 months (range, 3-73 months) after liver transplantation. The serum creatinine level was 1.81±0.5 mg\/dL at the time of kidney biopsy. There were no immediate complications. The most common diagnosis was glomerulonephritis (GN), such as immunoglobulin A nephropathy (n=4), mesangial proliferative GN (n=1), focal proliferative GN (n=1), and membranous GN (n=1). Typical calcineurin inhibitor (CNI)-induced nephrotoxicity was detected in three cases (30%). Chronic tissue changes such as glomerulosclerosis, interstitial fibrosis, and tubular atrophy were present in 90%, 80%, and 80% of cases, respectively, and mesangial proliferation was detected in 40% of cases. We began treatment for renal impairment based on the result of kidney biopsy; for example, angiotensin-receptor blockers or steroids were prescribed for GN, and the CNI dose was reduced for CNI nephrotoxicity. As a result, eight of 10 patients showed improvement in glomerular filtration rate, but two progressed to end-stage renal disease.\nCONCLUSION: Kidney biopsy is a safe and effective method for determining the cause of renal impairment after liver transplantation.

Renal biopsies were categorized according to the 2004 classification of the International Society of Nephrology\/Renal Pathology Society (ISN\/RPS). Survival plots, univariate and multivariate Cox regression analyses were applied.\nRESULTS: Female\/male ratio was 65\/17. Mortality rate was 6.1% (five patients). Fifty-five (67%), 18 (22%), and four (4.9%) patients had complete\/partial remission, chronic renal failure (CRF) and end-stage renal disease (ESRD), respectively. Renal biopsies showed 0, three (3.7%), 18 (22%), 58 (70.7%), two (2.4%) and 0 patients with ISN\/RPS classes I, II, III, IV, V and VI, respectively, and one patient (1.2%) with mixed class (IV and V).

        "Abstract":"BACKGROUND AND OBJECTIVES: Kidney disease as a complication of inflammatory bowel disease (IBD), including Crohn disease (CD) and ulcerative colitis (UC), has been the subject of case reports. However, no cases series examining IBD and kidney disease has been published to date. This study aimed to evaluate a large series of kidney biopsy specimens from patients with IBD to better define the spectrum and relative frequencies of IBD-associated kidney pathology.\nDESIGN, SETTING, PARTICIPANTS, & MEASUREMENTS: A retrospective review of native kidney biopsy specimens obtained from March 2001 to June 2012 identified 83 patients with IBD. Standard processing of all biopsy specimens included light microscopy, immunofluorescence, and electron microscopy.\nRESULTS: There were 45 cases of CD and 38 cases of UC represented. The most common indication for kidney biopsy was acute or chronic kidney failure (63% [52 of 83]) and nephrotic-range proteinuria (16% [13 of 83]). IgA nephropathy was the most common diagnosis (24% [20 of 83]), followed by interstitial nephritis (19% [16 of 83]), arterionephrosclerosis (12% [10 of 83]), acute tubular injury (8% [7 of 83]), proliferative GN (7% [6 of 83]), and minimal-change disease (5% [4 of 83]). When compared, the frequency of IgA nephropathy in IBD was significantly higher than in all other native renal biopsy specimens from the same time period (24% [20 of 83] versus 8% [2734 of 33,630]; P<0.001). Of the 16 cases of interstitial nephritis, 9 (56%) had current or recent past exposure to aminosalicylates, including all cases of granulomatous interstitial nephritis.\nCONCLUSIONS: IBD is associated with a spectrum of kidney diseases most commonly affecting the glomerular and tubulointerstitial compartments. IgA nephropathy is the most frequent kidney biopsy diagnosis in IBD and has a significantly higher diagnostic prevalence compared with all non-IBD kidney biopsy specimens. This may reflect a common pathogenic mechanism. Although many cases of tubulointerstitial nephritis are related to aminosalicylate exposure, the possibility of a direct relationship with IBD cannot be ruled out.",

To validate the ABMR score and assess its potential impact on practice, we performed the present prospective INTERCOM study (clinicaltrials.gov NCT01299168) in 300 new biopsies (264 patients) from six centers: Baltimore, Barcelona, Edmonton, Hannover, Manchester and Minneapolis. We assigned ABMR scores using the classifier created in the reference set and compared it to conventional assessment as documented in the pathology reports. INTERCOM documented uncertainty in conventional assessment: In 41% of biopsies where ABMR features were noted, the recorded diagnoses did not mention ABMR. The ABMR score correlated with ABMR histologic lesions and donor-specific antibodies, but not with T cell-mediated rejection lesions. The agreement between ABMR scores and conventional assessment was identical to that in the reference set (accuracy 85%). The ABMR score was more strongly associated with failure than conventional assessment, and when the ABMR score and conventional assessment disagreed, only the ABMR score was associated with early progression to failure. INTERCOM confirms the need to reduce uncertainty in the diagnosis of ABMR, and demonstrates the potential of the ABMR score to impact practice.",

        "Abstract":"The amount of irreversible injury on renal allograft biopsy predicts function, but little is known about the early evolution of this damage. In a single-center cohort, we examined the relationship between donor-, recipient-, and transplantation-associated factors and change in a morphometric index of chronic damage (ICD) between protocol biopsies performed at implantation and at 2-3 months. We then investigated whether early delta ICD predicted subsequent biochemical outcomes. We found little evidence to support differences between the study group, who had undergone serial biopsies, and a contemporaneous control group, who had not. In allografts with serial biopsies (n = 162), there was an increase in ICD between implantation (median: 2%, IQR:0-8) and 2-3 months post-transplant (median 8% IQR:4-15; p < 0.0001). Donation from younger or live donors was independently associated with smaller early post-transplant increases in ICD. There was no evidence for a difference in delta ICD between donation after cardiac death vs. donation after brain death, nor association with length of cold ischemia. After adjustment for GFR at the time of the second biopsy, delta ICD after three months did not predict allograft function at one yr. These findings suggest that graft damage develops shortly after transplantation and reflects donor factors, but does not predict future biochemical outcomes.",

        "Abstract":"BACKGROUND AND OBJECTIVE: We evaluated an alternative procedure for sentinel lymph node biopsy (SLNB) for breast cancer after approval of the study by the Ethics Committee of Tokyo Medical University Hospital in 2004. We examined the efficacy and safety of SLNB using the photosensitizer talaporfin sodium (Laserphyrin®, Meiji Seika Pharma, Tokoyo, Japan), compared with current methods.\nSTUDY DESIGN\/PATIENTS AND METHODS: The study included 21 breast cancer patients (Japanese women; median age, 54 years; range, 35-75). All patients received a breast cancer operation combined with SLNB between June 2004 and May 2005. Three milliliters of talaporfin solution was locally injected into the subareolar region just before the operation. We attempted to identify a sentinel lymph node (SLN) that exhibited fluorescence and was consistent with a radioisotope (RI) localization technique. Our purpose was to verify the accuracy and validity of the talaporfin fluorescence imaging method after 8 years of application.\nRESULTS: There was no consistent correlation between fluorescence and pathological SLN metastasis, although all four cases of pathological SLN metastasis revealed positive fluorescence. In some cases in which we could not identify SLNs by the RI technique, we could identify SLNs using talaporfin. The method using talaporfin did not adversely affect the patients after the operation, even the chronic renal failure patient. After 8 years, all patients are alive, and none had lymph node recurrence. Side effects were not observed.\nCONCLUSION: SLNB using the photosensitizer talaporfin sodium in breast cancer patients is considered to be useful as complementary to other current methods. We could evaluate the accuracy and validity of this method 8 years after all of the procedures were performed. In the future, a large-scale clinical study with statistical analyses should be conducted.",

        "Abstract":"BACKGROUND: In Sweden, native and transplant kidney biopsies are usually performed in major renal medical centers.\nPURPOSE: To clarify risk factors in native and transplant kidney biopsies to improve patient safety.\nMATERIAL AND METHODS: A total of 1001 biopsies (in 352 women and 565 men) were included. The median age was 54 years (range, 16-90 years). Data were derived from 826 native kidney biopsies (640 prospective and 186 retrospective) and 175 transplant kidney biopsies (170 prospective and 5 retrospective). Various factors and complications were registered while performing native and transplant kidney biopsies, focusing on major (e.g. blood transfusions, invasive procedures) and minor complications. The prospective protocol was used at six centers and at one center data were obtained retrospectively.\nRESULTS: Women were at greater risk of overall complications than men (12.2% vs. 6.5%; P = 0.003; odds ratio [OR], 2.0; confidence interval [CI], 1.3-3.1) as well as of major complications (9.6% vs. 4.5%; P = 0.002; OR, 2.2, CI 1.3-3.7). Major complications occurred more commonly after biopsies from the right kidney, in women than in men (10.8% vs. 3.1%; P = 0.005; OR, 3.7; CI, 1.5-9.5), and in patients with lower BMI (25.5 vs. 27.3, P = 0.016) and of younger age (45 years vs. 52.5 years; P = 0.001). Lower mean arterial pressure in transplant kidney biopsies indicated a risk of major complications (90 mmHg vs. 98 mmHg; P = 0.039). Factors such as needle size, number of passes, serum creatinine, and eGFR did not influence complication rates.\nCONCLUSION: The present findings motivate greater attention being paid to the risk of major side-effects after right-side biopsies from women's kidneys, as well as after biopsies from younger patients and patients with lower BMI.",

        "Abstract":"Background Doubling of serum creatinine (DSC) in transplantation has been seen as the end-point of renal function without pathological evidence. We conducted this study to elucidate the relationship between DSC and pathological findings. Material and Methods We conducted a retrospective cohort study to illustrate pathologic changes in patients receiving a kidney biopsy in the previous 5 years with clinicopathological correlations to DSC and proteinuria. Results Of a total of 99 kidney recipients (146 biopsies), results of graft biopsy were as follows: calcineurin inhibitor toxicity (CNI) (38.7%) and rejection (36.9%). Compared to males, females had higher proportions of class I (p=0.003) and class II PRA (p<0.001), and a higher rejection rate (p=0.042), but had the same clinical outcomes as males, like eGFR at follow-up (p=0.882), DSC (p=0.703), and proteinuria (p=0.745).                         Pathological diagnoses and findings were related to proteinuria: glomerulopathy (HR=4.9, p=0.01), AMR (HR=2.5, p=0.025), especially acute AMR (HR=2.9, p=0.008), chronic glomerular change (HR=10.2, p=0.002), arteriolar hyaline (HR=2.3, p=0.026), and mesangial matrix change (HR=6.3, p=0.002).                         BK nephropathy and rejection were the only 2 risk factors. Pathological findings favoring AMR (PTC infiltration and glomerulitis) showed a greater risk of DSC compared with those favoring CMR (interstitial inflammation, intimal arteritis, and tubulitis). DSC was correlated with clinical manifestation (rejection) and provided strong pathological evidence. Conclusions There was more acute rejection and chronic pathological change in women, but outcomes were the same due to less activity of renin-angiotensin-aldosterone and hyperfiltration in females. DSC as an end-point of graft function can be used to identify recipients, especially AMR or mixed AMR and CMR. 1.

In order to study this, all consecutive adult patients undergoing renal biopsy in West and Central Scotland over an 11-year period were prospectively analyzed for demographics, indication, and histologic diagnosis. Using the Scottish Index of Multiple Deprivation, 1555 eligible patients were separated into quintiles of socioeconomic deprivation according to postcode. Patients in the most deprived quintile were significantly more likely to undergo biopsy compared with patients from less deprived areas (109.5 compared to 95.9 per million population\/year). Biopsy indications were significantly more likely to be nephrotic syndrome, or significant proteinuria without renal impairment. Patients in the most deprived quintile were significantly more likely to have glomerulonephritis. There was a significant twofold increase in the diagnosis of IgA nephropathy in the patients residing in the most compared with the least deprived postcodes not explained by the demographics of the underlying population.

        "Abstract":"['6', '®', '®']\nRenal disease is epidemic in the United States with approximately 8 × 10 people having chronic kidney disease. Renal biopsies are widely used to provide essential diagnostic information to physicians. However, the risk of bleeding complications possibly leading to life-threatening situations results in the contra-indication of biopsy in certain patient populations. Safer renal biopsies will allow more accurate diagnosis and better management of this epidemic health problem. We report the preclinical testing of a novel biopsy device called the therapeutic injection system (TIS). The device introduces a third stage to the standard two-stage side-cut percutaneous biopsy process. The third stage is designed to reduce bleeding complications by injecting a hemostatic plug at the time of biopsy. Laboratory evaluation and preliminary in vivo animal testing using an anticoagulated porcine model of the TIS and Bard Monopty (Bard Medical, Covington, GA) control device were performed. The hemostatic material Gelfoam (Pfizer, Brussels, Belgium) was selected as the active material comprising the hemostatic plugs. The performance of two composite plugs, one composed of polyvinyl alcohol (PVA) combined in 2:1 and 12:1 ratios with the hemostatic material, and one plug composed of 100[Formula: see text] hemostatic material were tested. Stroke sequence and hemostatic plug deployment were verified by sequential firing of the TIS biopsy needle into clear gelatin and ex vivo bovine kidney specimens. In vivo trials with porcine specimens revealed a significant reduction in blood loss (8.1 [Formula: see text] 3.9 ml, control versus 1.9 [Formula: see text] 1.6 ml, 12:1 PVA\/hemostatic, TIS, [Formula: see text] = 0.01, [Formula: see text] = 6). The 100[Formula: see text] hemostatic plug showed a substantial and immediate reduction in blood loss (9.2 ml, control versus 0.0 ml, TIS, [Formula: see text] = 1). The prototype device was shown to work repeatedly and reliably in laboratory trials. Initial results show promise in this approach to control post biopsy bleeding. This solution maintains the simplicity and directness of the percutaneous approach, while not significantly changing the standard percutaneous biopsy procedure.",

This study sought to determine the usefulness of renal biopsy in patients with diabetes and the predictability of diagnosing diabetic nephropathy (DN) versus nondiabetic renal disease (NDRD) from clinical and laboratory data.\nDESIGN, SETTING, PARTICIPANTS, & MEASUREMENTS: To assess modern trends, a retrospective study was performed of clinical-pathologic findings in all patients with diabetes who had a biopsy in 2011. Among 2642 native kidney biopsies, 620 (23.5%) were from patients with diabetes.\nRESULTS: The cohort included 371 men (60.7%) aged a median (interquartile range) 62 years (52-69) with 10-year (5-15) duration of diabetes mellitus (DM). Median serum creatinine was 2.5 mg\/dl (1.6-4.4), and 52% of patients had stage 4-5 CKD. On biopsy, 37% of patients had DN alone, 36% had NDRD alone, and 27% had DN plus NDRD. In NDRD alone, FSGS (22%), hypertensive nephrosclerosis (18%), acute tubular necrosis (ATN) (17%), IgA nephropathy (11%), membranous GN (8%), and pauci-immune GN (7%) comprised 80% of diagnoses, compared with ATN (43%), hypertensive nephrosclerosis (19%), FSGS (13%), and IgA nephropathy (7%) for DN plus NDRD. In multivariate analyses, longer duration of DM was associated with a greater likelihood of DN and a lower likelihood of NDRD: each added year of DM reduced the odds of NDRD by 5% (odds ratio, 0.95; 95% confidence interval, 0.91 to 0.98; P=0.004). DM duration ≥ 12 years was the best predictor (58% sensitivity, 73% specificity) of DN alone.\nCONCLUSIONS: Approximately one-quarter of all renal biopsies are performed in patients with DM. Judicious use of renal biopsy has uncovered NDRD alone or superimposed on DN in the majority of such biopsies. ATN is emerging as an important category of NDRD, which has not been reported previously.",

Although AAD development is associated with chronic venous failure, less frequently AAD can develop as a complication of extremity paralysis, hemodialysis, post-traumatic arteriovenous fistula, amputated extremities, and vascular malformations (e.g., Klippel-Trénaunay syndrome). Pseudo-Kaposi's sarcoma can be histopathologically and clinically confused with malignant diseases such as Kaposi's sarcoma (1, 4). A 22-year-old male was referred to our outpatient clinic with a complaint of a non-healing wound on the distal phalanx of the left first toe. The patient was referred to various centers for 2 years and stated that he had received infection treatments but that his complaints did not disappear. An AAD diagnosis was established for the patient based on clinical and histopathologic evidence. Because he had early-onset disease and it was unilateral, the diagnosis was delayed.

To investigate the changing pattern of PGD in China, we retrospectively analyzed consecutive native renal biopsies performed in our hospital from 1997 to 2011. The patients were grouped according to a 3-year interval, 1997-1999 (period 1), 2000-2002 (period 2), 2003-2005 (period 3), 2006-2008 (period 4), 2009-2011 (period 5), and divided into three age groups (<20, 20-59, and ≥60 years old). 8,909 qualified cases were enrolled in this study. Among 8,909 specimens, 6,337 (71.13%) were diagnosed as PGD, while this prevalence decreased significantly from 77.61% in 1997-1999 to 66.73% in 2006-2008. IgA nephropathy (IgAN) was the most common PGD (36.66%), without any significant difference in the 5 periods (p = 0.185). IgAN was the most common PGD both in patients between the 20- to 59-year-old group (45.58%) and <20-year-old group (19.29%) as well. Membranous nephropathy (MN) was the most frequently found PGD in patients at age ≥60 years (39.64%).

All parameters were compared to show whether patients with GFR <60 ml\/min\/1.73 m(2) (group A) have higher risk of prostate cancer than patients with GFR ≥ 60 (group B). The primary endpoint was cancer detection rate and the secondary endpoints were differences in mean tPSA, fPSA, %fPSA and pathologic outcomes.\nRESULTS: A total of 1092 men (243 cancer patients) were included. Mean age was 65.8 ± 7.7 years. No differences in mean age and tPSA were found between groups A and B. Mean fPSA, %fPSA and cancer detection rate were significantly higher in group A than group B. The incidence of %fPSA <25% was significantly lower in group A than in group B. GFR <60 ml\/min\/1.73 m(2) , fPSA and %fPSA <25% were significant predictors for the presence of prostate cancer in patients with tPSA between 4 and 10 ng\/ml. However, %fPSA <25% was not a significant predictor for group A.\nCONCLUSIONS: Because of the increased cancer detection rates in patients with CKD of stage ≥ 3 whose tPSA levels are 4.0-10.0 ng\/ml, performing prostate biopsy should be actively considered in patients with CKD.",

Here we report the case of a 78-year-old white male with a past medical history of diabetes mellitus, hypertension, and chronic kidney disease stage III with a baseline serum creatinine of 2.5 mg\/dl. The patient had a prior admission history for acute kidney injury (AKI) attributed to dehydration and medication-induced nephro-toxicities. He presented to the renal clinic for follow-up with acute worsening of chronic kidney failure with a serum creatinine level of 3.5 mg\/dl. Examination revealed that he was anemic and mildly hypercalcemic with suppressed parathyroid hormone and had proteinuria of 1.3 g per day. The computed tomography scan of the abdomen revealed right renal pelvic non-obstructing calculi. Serum protein electrophoresis revealed gammopathy with two distinct monoclonal peaks consisting of immunoglobulin G (IgG) kappa and IgG lambda, respectively. The kappa\/lambda ratio was within normal limits, and urine protein electrophoresis showed no evidence of a monoclonal peak or Bence Jones proteins. Further workup for multiple myeloma, including bone marrow (BM) biopsy, revealed polyclonal plasma cells and B cells with no clonality. No morphological and immune-phenotypic evidence of plasma cell dyscrasia was found, but BM biopsy did show numerous non-caseating granulomas consistent with sarcoidosis. Skin biopsy from non-scaly 6-mm skin colored papule also showed non-caseating granulomas. The patient had elevated angiotensin-converting enzyme levels (165 ug\/l) and an erythrocyte sedimentation rate of 27 mm\/h. Kidney biopsy did not show granulomas. The hypercalcemia, proteinuria, and AKI responded well after 2 weeks of 60 mg oral prednisone daily.",

        "Abstract":"BACKGROUND: Renal biopsy procedure in patients with chronic renal failure (CRF) may represent a valid tool to help clinicians in clinical practice. However, the use of this invasive method in CRF is variable and it reflects the hospital biopsy policy.\nMETHODS: To better define the CRF-related histological patterns and to assess the clinical utility of this procedure in this extensive group, we analyzed biopsy records of 1,185 CRF patients living in a large area of north-east Italy from 1998 to 2010.\nRESULTS: Data analysis showed that, although the biopsy incidence rate and the histological features were unchanged, the mean age of our CRF patients increased during the study period (R(2) = 0.42, p < 0.01). Primary and secondary glomerulonephritis (SGNs) were the main histological presentations (53.9 and 23%, respectively). SGNs were over-diagnosed in females. Leading histological types were immunoglobulin A nephropathy (22%), focal segmental glomerulosclerosis (12.4%), membranous glomerulonephritis (MGN, 7.5%) and nephroangiosclerosis (7.3%). These forms were also highly frequent in CRF patients with elevated proteinuria and moderate\/severe renal damage. Elderly patients were primarily affected by MGN. After biopsy, 49.5% of CRF patients with and 34.1% without nephrotic syndrome received immunosuppression therapy.\nCONCLUSIONS: This study demonstrated that renal biopsy in CRF patients, regardless of age and glomerular filtration rates, is safe and essential to achieve a correct diagnosis and to commence the correct therapy. Additionally, it revealed that, even in patients with severe renal damage, it is possible to perform an accurate histological diagnosis and, interestingly, end-stage kidney disease seems not to be the primary form.",

        "Abstract":"BACKGROUND: Patients with chronic kidney disease (CKD) develop renal osteodystrophy with alterations in bone turnover, mineralization, and volume (TMV). A specific skeletal complication in children is growth impairment, which currently is treated by recombinant human growth hormone (rhGH). The effects on bone material properties are poorly understood. This study assesses the effects of rhGH treatment on bone matrix mineralization.\nSTUDY DESIGN: Observational study.\nSETTING & PARTICIPANTS: 18 short children and adolescents (aged 3.6-16 years) with CKD on dialysis therapy.\nPREDICTOR: rhGH treatment for 1 year.\nOUTCOMES: Tetracycline-labeled bone biopsy classified according to the TMV system.\nMEASUREMENTS: Bone mineralization density distribution (BMDD) was evaluated by quantitative backscattered electron imaging in trabecular and cortical compartments. Additional data for patients' height and biochemical bone serum parameters were obtained.\nRESULTS: Prior to rhGH treatment, our cohort showed low bone turnover and high mineralization densities versus reference data: Ca(mean) (weighted mean calcium content) in cancellous bone, +3.3% (P = 0.04); Ca(mean) in cortical bone, +6.7% (P < 0.001); Ca(peak) (mode of the BMDD) in cancellous bone, +5.0% (P < 0.001); Ca(peak) in cortical bone, +8.2% (P < 0.001); Ca(width) (heterogeneity in mineralization), no significant difference for cancellous (P = 0.2) and cortical (P = 0.1) bone; Ca(high) (portion of fully mineralized bone) in cancellous bone, 5-fold greater (P < 0.001); Ca(high) in cortical bone, 14-fold greater (P < 0.001); Ca(low) (portion of low mineralized bone) in cancellous bone, +23.9% (P = 0.02); Ca(low) in cortical bone, -22.2% (P = 0.05). After rhGH treatment, height increased by 9.1 cm (P < 0.001) and bone turnover indices to normal values or beyond. Matrix mineralization was lesser and more heterogeneous compared to baseline: Ca(width) for cancellous bone, +15.3% (P < 0.001); Ca(width) for cortical bone, +34.1% (P < 0.001). Ca(mean), Ca(peak), and Ca(high) for cancellous bone and Ca(mean) and Ca(peak) for cortical bone were no longer significantly different from reference data. Ca(high) for cortical bone dramatically decreased after treatment but was still substantially greater than reference data.\nLIMITATIONS: Low case number per TMV subgroup, no measurements of fibroblast growth factor 23.\nCONCLUSIONS: Children and adolescents with CKD and growth deficiency are at risk of having low bone turnover. rhGH treatment improves height and concomitantly bone modeling\/remodeling, which appears beneficial for bone matrix mineralization.",

SETTING; Queen Mary Hospital, Hong Kong.\nPATIENTS: All post-liver transplantation patients who had a renal biopsy in the period from January 2000 to December 2010.\nRESULTS: Eleven renal biopsies were retrieved for review from 10 patients with liver transplantation. The male-to-female ratio was 9:1 (age range, 47-63 years). The median liver transplant-to-renal biopsy interval was 1590 (range, 102-3699) days. The predominant histological changes were interstitial fibrosis and tubular atrophy. Diabetic nephropathy (n=6) and immunoglobulin A nephropathy (n=4) were the commonest glomerulopathies. Only one patient had chronic calcineurin inhibitor nephrotoxicity. With a mean follow-up of 53 months, three patients died 2 to 53 months post-renal biopsy. All surviving patients had chronic renal impairment. Five patients developed end-stage renal failure and four had significant persistent proteinuria.\nCONCLUSION: Renal pathology was variable after liver transplantation; most biopsies showed complex renal lesions, whilst calcineurin inhibitor nephrotoxicity was rare. The recognition of kidney histology attributable to metabolic derangements after liver transplantation is potentially important in the interpretation of renal biopsy specimens and patient management. The renal outlook of this group of patients is guarded.",

        "Abstract":"BACKGROUND: Previous epidemiological studies have focused on the prevalence of primary glomerulonephritis (GN), but few have explored long-term patient outcomes. This study was conducted to investigate the long-term patient and renal outcomes of primary GN.\nMETHODS: A total of 1,943 biopsy-proven primary GN patients were included. The outcomes were mortality and end-stage renal disease (ESRD) progression. The relative mortality rate was expressed by the standardized mortality ratio (SMR) and the 95% confidence interval (CI).\nRESULTS: During the median follow-up of 90 months, 325 (16.7%) patients progressed to ESRD and 164 (8.4%) patients died. Patients with minimal change disease exhibited the best renal and patient outcomes, whereas those with membranoproliferative GN had the worst. IgA nephropathy patients appeared to have a good survival rate in spite of their considerable progression to ESRD, and focal segmental glomerulosclerosis patients showed poor renal and patient outcomes. Mortality was 67% higher in primary GN patients than in the age- and sex-matched general population (SMR, 1.67; 95% CI, 1.42-1.95). The difference was more prominent in women (SMR, 2.95; 95% CI, 2.27-3.77) than in men (SMR, 1.31; 95% CI, 1.07-1.60). Renal risk factors, e.g. hypertension, proteinuria and initial renal dysfunction, were all associated with higher mortality, and the relative mortality rate increased with the number of risk factors.\nCONCLUSIONS: In patients with primary GN, mortality is significantly higher than in the age-\/sex-matched general population, especially in women. Moreover, the presence of renal risk factors is positively associated with both relative mortality and progression to ESRD.",

Bone biopsy is thus far the only window into cellular and molecular events in bone. This review will focus on recent insights into the pathophysiology of renal bone disease, as highlighted by bone biopsy, and discuss implications for treatment.\nRECENT FINDINGS: Abnormalities in bone physiology start very early in children and adults with CKD, when most clinically measurable mineral metabolism parameters are normal. In addition, racial differences, known to exist in serum markers such as parathyroid hormone, also appear prominent in the bone, suggesting that clinical treatment guidelines may not address the needs of all patient populations. The effects of treatments for secondary hyperparathyroidism on bone may be unexpected.\nSUMMARY: With the help of bone biopsy studies, molecular insights into the pathogenesis of renal osteodystrophy are beginning to emerge.

Aim of our investigation was to evaluate the clinico-pathological correlation of myofibroblasts expression as markers for initial development of fibrotic processes and macrophagic infiltration in a population with impaired renal function, in order to better understand their value in diagnostic biopsies.\nMATERIALS, METHODS AND RESULTS: We evaluated 20 consecutive native kidney biopsies performed for diagnostic purposes. Material remaining after routine light microscopy and immunofluorescence, was stained for α-SMA as myofibroblast marker and CD68 as macrophage infiltration marker. Quantitative evaluation was conducted by electronic image analysis on consecutive low power fields, avoiding glomeruli, and estimated as percentage of the total area or as number of positive cells\/field for macrophage infiltration. The renal biopsies were also evaluated for histological characteristics such as percentual area of inflammation infiltration and fibrosis. Clinical and laboratory data were recorded at biopsy moment and followed-up on a period of 17 ± 11 months after the renal biopsy. Interstitial α-SMA immunoexpression proved to be related with interstitial fibrosis (r=-0.47, p<0.001) and macrophage infiltration (r=0.21, p=0.03). Higher immunoexpression of α-SMA was related with renal function assessed by creatinine level at biopsy moment (r=0.32, p=0.002).\nCONCLUSIONS: In this study, detection of myofibroblast infiltration using α-smooth-muscle actin (α-SMA) proved to be a good marker in describing the initial phases of interstitial fibrosis development in early stages of chronic kidney dysfunction.",

        "Abstract":"PURPOSE: The aim of this study was to investigate the relationship between percent-free prostate-specific antigen (PSA) and estimated glomerular filtration rate (GFR) in men whose PSA level was 4-10 ng\/ml with biopsy-proven prostate status.\nMETHODS: Between 2004 and 2010, the medical records of 495 cases (404 cases without prostate cancer and 91 cases with prostate cancer) who underwent prostate biopsy were reviewed and their GFR was calculated using the Cockcroft-Gault equation, adjusted for body surface area. Correlation and multivariate regression analyses were conducted among percent-free PSA, body mass index, prostate size, and GFR in patients with and without prostate cancer, respectively.\nRESULTS: The mean patient age was 64.6 years, and the median PSA and free PSA were 5.64 and 0.87 ng\/ml. The mean GFR was 61.02 mL\/min\/1.73 m2, and mean percent-free PSA was 18.9%. Correlation analysis showed that percent-free PSA was correlated with GFR, age, and prostate size in the non-cancer cohort and correlated with only prostate size in the cancer cohort. Multivariate regression analysis showed that percent-free PSA was influenced by GFR (p < 0.001) and prostate size (p < 0.001) independently in the non-cancer cohort, while only by prostate size (p = 0.008) in the cancer cohort.\nCONCLUSIONS: Percent-free PSA has a negative relationship with GFR in the benign prostate group, while it does not in the prostate cancer group.

        "Abstract":"Regulatory T cells (Tregs) were shown to be involved into the pathogenesis of acute rejection after transplantation. The suppressive activity of the total regulatory T cell pool depends on its percentage of highly suppressive HLA-DR(+) -Treg cells. Therefore, both the suppressive activity of the total Treg pool and the extent of HLA-DR expression of HLA-DR(+) -Tregs (MFI HLA-DR) were estimated in non transplanted volunteers, patients with end-stage renal failure (ESRF), healthy renal transplant patients with suspicion on rejection, due to sole histological Bord-R or sole acute renal failure (ARF), and patients with clinically relevant borderline rejection (Bord-R and ARF). Compared to patients with only Bord-R or only ARF, the suppressive activity of the total Treg cell pool was exclusively reduced in patients with clinically relevant Bord-R. In parallel, the HLA-DR MFI of the DR(+) -Treg subset was significantly decreased in these patients, due to a significantly lower proportion of DR(high+) -Tregs, which were shown to have the highest suppressive capacity within the total Treg pool. Our findings clearly demonstrate that the determination of the HLA-DR MFI of the HLA-DR(+) -Treg subset allows a highly sensitive, specific and non-invasive discrimination between patients with clinically relevant Bord-R (Bord and ARF) and patients with subclinical rejection or other causes of transplant failure.",

Serum C4d level, which is a degradation product of complement factor C4, was found to be a sensitive indicator of SLE activity. Our aim was to determine whether glomerular C4d staining could be a useful marker of disease activity in patients with lupus nephritis.\nMETHODS: This retrospective study included all consecutive patients who underwent a renal biopsy at our center between January 2005 and December 2009. A total of 29 patients with IgA nephritis were enrolled, and renal biopsy specimens of 24 patients have been evaluated. We evaluated baseline age, sex, hypertension, serum creatinine level, glomerular filtration rate (GFR), urine protein, and glomerular C4d staining. The primary endpoint of this study was the onset of end-stage renal disease (ESRD) in the course of study.\nRESULTS: Fourteen (58%) patients were C4d+ and 10 (42%) patients C4d-. Urinary protein excretion was more elevated in C4d+ group (p = 0.0001). The renal biopsy showed that activity index score >12 was a higher proportion in C4d+ patients.

The mean glomerular volume was estimated from the outer capillary area of individual glomeruli, and the clinicopathological factors at biopsy that were associated with the mean glomerular volume were analyzed in each group.\nRESULTS: The mean glomerular volume showed maximal 5.8 and 7.9-fold variations between individuals in the non-GN and IgAN groups, respectively. In both groups, the body mass index and glomerular density (non-sclerotic glomerular number per renal cortical area of the biopsy) were consistently identified as independent factors that were associated with the mean glomerular volume. In addition, the multivariate analyses using the glomerular density\/body mass index ratio showed a more close association with the mean glomerular volume than the analyses using each measure separately.\nCONCLUSION: These results suggest that factors presumably reflecting both body consumption and nephron number have close relationships with the glomerular size, regardless of mechanism(s) underlying the injury.

The study included 56 patients. They had at least one non-renal organ failure, as defined by a Sequential Organ Failure Assessment (SOFA) score ≥3 on ICU admission, and kidney biopsy was performed during ICU stay. Kidney samples were obtained by percutaneous (N.=55) or transjugular biopsy (N.=1).\nRESULTS: The mean Simplified Acute Physiology Score II and total SOFA scores on ICU admission were 52±19 years and 10.3±3.6, respectively. ICU mortality was 23%. The median (interquartile range) time between ICU admission and kidney biopsy was 9 days (5-21). Pathologic findings in the 54 analyzable kidney biopsies were acute tubular necrosis (N.=26), glomerulonephritis (N.=14), acute vascular nephritis (N.=11), acute interstitial nephritis (N.=6), and deposit disease (N.=3). Kidney biopsy was contributive to the management of 40 patients. In 23 of these, new treatments were started, in 13 ongoing treatments were stopped, including four life-sustaining therapies, and in 13 it was decided to start chronic renal replacement. Severe bleeding was observed in 7 patients, with fatal outcome in one case.\nCONCLUSION: Kidney biopsy may have a significant impact on the management of critically ill patients. Further studies should be done to identify the groups of ICU patients likely to benefit from the procedure with minimum risk.",

        "Abstract":"Fabry disease (FD) is a rare, X-linked inherited disease of glycosphingolipid metabolism due to deficiency of lysosomal α-galactosidase A activity. Scarce activity of lysosomal α-galactosidase A results in progressive accumulation of globotriaosylceramide (Gb3) within lysosomes, believed to trigger a flow of cellular changes that lead to the clinical manifestation of the disease. We present a 23-year-old male with renal variant of FD who was born from non-affected parents, which, to the best of our knowledge, has not been reported in the literature so far. In conclusion, FD can occur due to sporadic GLA gene mutation. Pure renal involvement might be associated with progressive disease which leads to end-stage renal disease within a short period. Physicians should have a high index of suspicion for FD especially in male cases with unexplained renal failure that are slowly progressive in nature, even in the absence of a clear hereditary component. Early renal biopsy is recommended in any progressive renal impairment.",

        "Abstract":"Uric acid (UA) can induce renal arteriolopathy in animal models. Whether there is an association between UA and renal arteriolopathy in patients with chronic kidney disease (CKD) is unknown. Here, we examined the cross-sectional association of serum UA levels with renal arteriolar hyalinosis and wall thickening. Arteriolar parameters were assessed by semiquantitative grading (max: grade 3) of arterioles in 167 patients with CKD (mean age, 42.4 years; 86 men and 81 women) who underwent renal biopsy. The mean serum UA level was 6.4 mg dl(-1). We observed hyalinosis in 94 patients (56%) and wall thickening in 119 patients (71%). As the UA level tertile increased, the proportion of higher-grade (grade 2 and 3) hyalinosis and wall thickening increased (hyalinosis, P<0.0001 and wall thickening, P=0.0002, for trend). Multiple logistic analysis adjusted for age ≥40 years, sex, hypertension status, diabetes mellitus status and estimated glomerular filtration rate <60 ml min(-1) per 1.73 m(2) showed that hyperuricemia (UA ≥7 mg dl(-1)) was significantly associated with a higher risk of hyalinosis (adjusted odds ratio: 3.13; 95% confidence interval: 1.23-7.94; P=0.02) and higher-grade (equal to or higher than the mean value) wall thickening (adjusted odds ratio: 2.66; 95% confidence interval: 1.11-6.38; P=0.03). Hence, these results suggest that hyperuricemia may be related to renal arteriolar damage in patients with CKD.",

        "Abstract":"Australia's Indigenous people have high rates of chronic kidney disease and kidney failure. To define renal disease among these people, we reviewed 643 renal biopsies on Indigenous people across Australia, and compared them with 249 biopsies of non-Indigenous patients. The intent was to reach a consensus on pathological findings and terminology, quantify glomerular size, and establish and compare regional biopsy profiles. The relative population-adjusted biopsy frequencies were 16.9, 6.6, and 1, respectively, for Aboriginal people living remotely\/very remotely, for Torres Strait Islander people, and for non-remote-living Aboriginal people. Indigenous people more often had heavy proteinuria and renal failure at biopsy. No single condition defined the Indigenous biopsies and, where biopsy rates were high, all common conditions were in absolute excess. Indigenous people were more often diabetic than non-Indigenous people, but diabetic changes were still present in fewer than half their biopsies. Their biopsies also had higher rates of segmental sclerosis, post-infectious glomerulonephritis, and mixed morphologies. Among the great excess of biopsies in remote\/very remote Aborigines, females predominated, with younger age at biopsy and larger mean glomerular volumes. Glomerulomegaly characterized biopsies with mesangiopathic changes only, with IgA deposition, or with diabetic change, and with focal segmental glomerulosclerosis (FSGS). This review reveals great variations in biopsy rates and findings among Indigenous Australians, and findings refute the prevailing dogma that most indigenous renal disease is due to diabetes. Glomerulomegaly in remote\/very remote Aboriginal people is probably due to nephron deficiency, in part related to low birth weight, and probably contributes to the increased susceptibility to kidney disease and the predisposition to FSGS.",

        "Abstract":"The Piedmont Group of Clinical Nephrology has compared the activity of 18 nephrology centers in the region Piedmont\/Valle d'Aosta with regard to renal biopsy (RB). Data on the RBs performed in every nephrology unit, taking into account their entire experience (in some cases spanning more than 30 years), were analyzed. 3396 RBs were performed between 1996 and 2011. Thirty to forty percent were done in patients aged >-65 years (1568 in patients >-65 years, 29 in patients >-85 years). 598 BRs were performed in children over the last 20 years. The following contraindications to RB were considered: chronic renal failure by 8 centers (44.4%), serum creatinine (SCr >3 mg\/dL) by 3 centers, longitudinal renal size <8 cm by 3 centers, and renal cortex thickness <1 cm by 2 centers. 1798 RBs were performed in patients with SCr >2 mg\/dL and 275 in patients on dialysis. The percentage of RBs performed in patients with SCr >2 mg\/dL ranged from 27% to 55% between centers. As regards RB in the course of acute renal failure in an ANCA-positive context, 4 centers allowed administration of corticosteroids and 8 centers administration of immunosuppressive treatment as well, even in the absence of histological data. In drug-related nephropathies, RB was considered indicated to confirm the farhypothesis of immunoallergic interstitial nephropathy either if the responsible drug was not among the traditional ones known to induce tubulo-interstitial renal disease or if the pharmacological hypothesis seemed no longer sufficient to justify the renal presentation. All centers but one were against performing RB in case of atheroembolic disease. Three centers performed RB in the intensive care unit. As regards RB in patients undergoing treatment with anticoagulants, aspirin was discontinued 5-14 days before the procedure (mean 8 days) and given again 7-15 days afterwards (mean 11.4 days). Ten centers replaced the anticoagulants with low-dose heparin, which was discontinued the day before the procedure; 11 centers asked advice from cardiologists. RB was repeated in 113 cases after a delay of 1 month to 8 years from the first RB. Our analysis shows uniformity in the approach to RB in this Italian region, with some differences compared with the literature: particular attention was paid to severely critical patients, elderly patients, and patients treated with anticoagulant drugs.",

The clinical manifestations, the reason why they had renal biopsy again, the difference in renal pathological findings, between the two biopsies and their therapeutic response. The classification of focal segmental glomerulosclerosis (FSGS) was based on the new criteria suggested by D'Agati in 2004.\nRESULT: Of the 8 cases, age of onset ranged from 1 to 12 years, all were diagnosed as nephrotic syndrome (NS), the age of first biopsy ranged from 1.1 to 15.0 years, and the follow-up period was 10 months to 14 years. The reason for repeated biopsy was poor therapeutic response, continuous heavy proteinuria, or the progressive renal dysfunction. Four cases had the both biopsies in this hospital, and the first renal pathology showed minimal change disease (MCD), mesangial proliferation, FSGS CELL type and FSGS GTL type. After the second biopsy, they were additionally treated with immunosuppressive agents or switched to another one, 2 cases with FSGS COLL type presented renal dysfunction or end stage renal disease (ESRD), 1 case who developed the disease at 1.4 years of age, presented renal dysfunction at 10 months follow-up. The remaining 5 cases acquired complete remission.\nCONCLUSION: FSGS is a clinicopathological syndrome, NS predominates clinically. It often indicates pathologic transformation when the patients show poor therapeutic response or continuous heavy proteinuria without remission. Mesangial proliferation can convert into FSGS, and the subtype of FSGS can shift. FSGS COLL type and onset at young age may suggest poor prognosis.",

Despite the KDOQI guideline recommendation for histological diagnosis of kidney disease to enable risk stratification, its optimal time point has not been evaluated. We have therefore analyzed whether histological diagnosis of glomerulonephritis (GN) at an early stage of chronic kidney disease (CKD) is associated with different outcome compared to diagnosis at a more advanced stage.\nMETHODS: A cohort of 424 consecutive patients with histological diagnosis of GN were included in a retrospective data analysis. Kidney function was assessed by glomerular filtration rate (GFR) estimation at the time point of kidney biopsy and after consecutive immunosuppressive therapy. Censored events were death, initiation of dialysis or kidney transplantation, or progression of disease, defined as deterioration of CKD stage ≥ 1 from kidney biopsy to last available kidney function measurement.\nRESULTS: Occurrence of death, dialysis\/transplantation or progression of disease were associated with GFR and CKD stage at the time of kidney biopsy (p < 0.001 for all). Patients with CKD stage 1 and 2 at kidney biopsy had fewer endpoints compared to patients with a GFR of <60 ml\/min (p < 0.001).\nCONCLUSION: Kidney function at the time point of histological GN diagnosis is associated with clinical outcome, likely due to early initiation of specific drug treatment. This suggests that selection of therapy yields greatest benefit before renal function is impaired in GN.",

        "Abstract":"PURPOSE: Patients with end stage renal disease plus prostate cancer are ineligible to receive a renal transplant at most centers until an acceptable cancer-free period is demonstrated. To our knowledge previously established prostate specific antigen reference ranges have not been validated in patients with end stage renal disease. We determined age stratified 95th percentile prostate specific antigen reference ranges and the prostate cancer detection rate at specific prostate specific antigen intervals for patients with end stage renal disease.\nMATERIALS AND METHODS: We retrospectively reviewed the records of 775 male patients with end stage renal disease on the waiting list for a renal transplant who had undergone a serum prostate specific antigen test. Prostate specific antigen was stratified by age at the time of the blood test and 95th percentile reference ranges were calculated for each decade. A total of 80 patients underwent prostate biopsy for increased prostate specific antigen and\/or abnormal digital rectal examination. The cancer detection rate was calculated for specific prostate specific antigen reference ranges.\nRESULTS: The age specific 95th percentile prostate specific antigen references ranges were 0 to 4.0 ng\/ml for ages 40 to 49 in 137 patients, 0 to 5.3 ng\/ml for ages 50 to 59 in 257, 0 to 10.5 ng\/ml for ages 60 to 69 in 265 and 0 to 16.6 ng\/ml for ages 70 to 79 years in 69. The cancer detection rate was 44%, 38% and 67% for prostate specific antigen 2.5 to 4.0, 4 to 10 and greater than 10 ng\/ml, respectively.\nCONCLUSIONS: In our study population of patients with end stage renal disease age stratified prostate specific antigen was higher than in the general population. The cancer detection rate was increased in our patients with end stage renal disease compared to that in patients with normal renal function at specific prostate specific antigen intervals. Lower prostate specific antigen cutoffs may be appropriate to recommend prostate biopsy in patients with end stage renal disease.",

The majority of the PTLD (post-transplant lymphoproliferative disorder) is seen in kidney transplant recipients simply because they constitute a larger group of transplant recipients each year as compared to other solid organ transplantations. Primary infection of previously infected EBV seronegative patients and immunosuppression are found to be the main etiologic factors in the development of PTLD-PCNSL. There are no clear guidelines on treatment regimens, and it should be individualized according to patient comorbidities. We report a case of PCNS lymphoproliferative disorder in a kidney transplant recipient, which underwent complete remission with decreasing immunosuppression. The patient could not undergo chemotherapy\/radiotherapy due to underlying comorbidities. We highlight the available treatment modalities for PTLD-PCNSL.",

        "Abstract":"OBJECTIVES: The outcome and the therapy of patients with diabetes mellitus (DM), diabetic nephropathy (DN), and non-diabetic renal disease (NDRD) are quite different, so the differential diagnosis is of considerable importance. To evaluate the usefulness of renal biopsy in type 2 diabetic patients, we examined the relationship between the clinical parameters and the histopathological findings in different age groups.\nMETHODS: Renal biopsy specimens and clinical and laboratory data from 216 patients with type 2 DM were evaluated. According to their age, three groups were defined: 17-35 years (group I), 36-59 years (group II), and more than 60 years (group III).\nRESULTS: The study showed that, beside the duration of diabetes, other clinical parameters were not significantly different between the three groups. Chronic nephritic syndrome was the most common clinical manifestation in group I (44.1 %) and in group II (34.0 %). Among patients in group III, we found a high prevalence of chronic renal failure (34.3 %) and nephrotic syndrome (28.6 %). Consistent with the clinical manifestations, IgA nephropathy was the most common pathologic finding in group I (29.4 %) and in group II (34.7 %), whereas the most frequent abnormalities in group III were membranous nephropathy (25.7 %) and tubulointerstitial lesions (14.3 %). Overall, among these patients, 14 cases were diagnosed with DN (6.5 %), 179 with NDRD (82.9 %), while 23 had concurrent DN and NDRD (10.7 %).\nCONCLUSIONS: Our results indicated that the clinical manifestations and pathologic findings in type 2 diabetic patients in different age groups have different features. This study emphasized the usefulness of renal biopsy for determining the pattern of renal damage and thus for the overall management of type 2 diabetic patients.",

Acute kidney injury (AKI) was the main indication for biopsy (47%), followed by nephrotic syndrome (32%). Amyloidosis was the most common histological diagnosis (16.9%), followed by crescentic glomerulonephritis type 3 associated with systemic vasculitis (14.1%). When histological findings were correlated with clinical syndromes, we found that amyloidosis was the leading cause of AKI (18.8%), and also the main determinant of nephrotic syndrome, with the same frequency as membranous nephropathy (22%). Crescentic glomerulonephritis type 3 associated with vasculitis was related to a greater diversity of clinical syndromes, especially chronic kidney disease (40%) and AKI (40%).\nCONCLUSIONS: Renal biopsy in the very elderly provides us with useful information, despite the advanced age of the patients.

        "Abstract":"Chronic allograft injury (CAI) results from a humoral response to mismatches in immunogenic epitopes between the donor and recipient. Although alloantibodies against HLA antigens contribute to the pathogenesis of CAI, alloantibodies against non-HLA antigens likely contribute as well. Here, we used high-density protein arrays to identify non-HLA antibodies in CAI and subsequently validated a subset in a cohort of 172 serum samples collected serially post-transplantation. There were 38 de novo non-HLA antibodies that significantly associated with the development of CAI (P<0.01) on protocol post-transplant biopsies, with enrichment of their corresponding antigens in the renal cortex. Baseline levels of preformed antibodies to MIG (also called CXCL9), ITAC (also called CXCL11), IFN-γ, and glial-derived neurotrophic factor positively correlated with histologic injury at 24 months. Measuring levels of these four antibodies could help clinicians predict the development of CAI with >80% sensitivity and 100% specificity. In conclusion, pretransplant serum levels of a defined panel of alloantibodies targeting non-HLA immunogenic antigens associate with histologic CAI in the post-transplant period. Validation in a larger, prospective transplant cohort may lead to a noninvasive method to predict and monitor for CAI.",

Therefore, alternative biopsy sites have been proposed with varying degrees of sensitivity. We aimed to find the most appropriate biopsy site in patients with chronic kidney disease (CKD) in whom renal biopsy is contraindicated or unavailable. 42 patients (29 male; mean age 46 ± 16 y) with CKD in whom amyloidosis was suspected as the underlying etiology on clinical grounds, but renal biopsy was not available (Group I), and 36 patients (25 male; mean age 40 ± 16 y) with CKD in whom renal biopsy revealed AA-amyloidosis (Group II) were investigated. Upper and lower gastrointestinal tract (GIT) endoscopies were performed and multiple biopsies from gingiva, esophagus, antrum, duodenum and rectum were obtained. In Group I, no amyloidosis was detected in gingival and GIT biopsies among 13 patients. In the remaining 29 patients AA-amyloidosis was detected in various sites with the following frequencies: duodenum 100%, rectum 83%, antrum 79%, esophagus 44% and gingiva 29%. In Group II, frequency of amyloid deposition was 97% in duodenum, 76% each in antrum and rectum, 59% in esophagus and 32% in gingival mucosa. In conclusion, duodenal biopsy is sensitive for diagnosing amyloidosis in CKD patients, and highly correlates with renal amyloidosis.",

The aims of this study were to determine the incidence of IgAN recurrence as assessed by protocol biopsies and to identify predictive factors for recurrence.\nMETHODS: We identified 65 protocol biopsies taken before the second year post-transplantation in patients with IgAN as primary renal disease. Diagnosis of recurrence of IgA was based on the detection of at least 1+ mesangial deposits of IgA. Pathological findings and clinical characteristics were retrospectively compared between recurrent and non-recurrent cases.\nRESULTS: IgAN recurrence rate was 32%. Mesangial C3 was detected in 83% of recurrent cases versus 17% in non-recurrent patients (P < 0.001). Normal urinalysis was observed in 52%. Non-recurrent patients had arteriolar hyalinosis in 31% of the cases versus none in IgAN recurrence (P = 0.006). Seventy-nine per cent of cyclosporine users were free of recurrence, whereas 45% of the patients without cyclosporine experienced recurrence (P = 0.03). The odds ratio (OR) for IgAN recurrence in patients using cyclosporine was 0.3 (confidence interval 0.1-0.9). Zero HLA-DR mismatch was associated with non-recurrence (P < 0.01). The OR for IgA recurrence was 6.7 if any degree of DR mismatch was present. IgAN recurrent patients had better glomerular filtration rate, but after censoring delayed graft function, the differences disappeared.

        "Abstract":"INTRODUCTION: Hypertensive nephroangiosclerosis is a major cause of chronic kidney disease requiring dialysis. Clinical characteristics that distinguish a patient with hypertension that evolves to nephroangiosclerosis from another that keeps stable renal function are not well established because of the difficulty in ensuring that the carriers of that disease are not actually suffering from glomerulonephritis or other kidney diseases. Thus, our objective was to identify clinical or laboratory features that distinguish the patients who developed chronic renal failure from hypertension, confirmed by renal biopsy, of those who, even with arterial hypertension, did not develop nephroangiosclerosis.\nMETHODS: We conducted a retrospective comparison of clinical and laboratory data of 15 patients with hypertensive nephroangiosclerosis confirmed by renal biopsy and 15 hypertensive patients from the outpatient clinic of the Hypertension Center, whose lack of nephroangiosclerosis was defined as absence of proteinuria. The groups were matched for age and gender.\nRESULTS: Among the evaluated variables, duration of hypertension, pulse pressure, blood glucose, uric acid, creatinine and frequency of use of diuretics and sympatholytic differed statistically between the two groups. All these variables were higher in nephroangiosclerosis patients.\nCONCLUSION: This study links biopsy proven hypertensive nephroangiosclerosis with metabolic features, hypertension intensity and duration, corroborating the idea that primary prevention of hypertension, postponing its initiation, a more intensive hemodynamic control (when hypertension is well established) and metabolic control of these patients have the potential to prevent hypertensive nephroangiosclerosis.",

This study analyzed the distribution of biopsy-proven renal disease (BPRD) and its changing pattern over a period of 19 years from a tertiary care hospital in south India. All the renal biopsies performed from 1990 to 2008 were reviewed retrospectively. Biopsies were evaluated by light microscopy and immunofluorescence microscopy and also special stains when warranted. A total of 1849 biopsies were analyzed. The mean patient age was 32.27 ± 18.38 (range 10-80) years. The male:female ratio was 1.4:1. The most common indications of renal biopsy were nephrotic syndrome (49%), followed by chronic renal failure (13.6%) and rapidly progressive renal failure (12%). Primary glomerulonephritis (PGN) comprised 1278 (69.1%) of the total patients. Among the PGN cases, the most common one was minimal change disease (21.8%), followed by focal segmental glomerulosclerosis [FSGS (15.3%)], membranous glomerulonephritis (10%), chronic glomerulonephritis (9.7%), postinfectious glomerulonephritis (8.1%), mesengioproliferative glomerulonephritis (7.5%), diffuse proliferative glomerulonephritis (6.7%), crescentic glomerulonephritis (6.5%), IgA nephropathy [IgAN (6.3%)], membranoproliferative glomerulonephritis (5.7%), focal proliferative glomerulonephritis (1.6%) and IgM nephropathy (0.5). Secondary glomerular disease (SGN) accounted for 337 (18.2%) of the cases. The most common SGN was lupus nephritis (80.1%), followed by amyloidosis (8%) and diabetic nephropathy (6.5%). Tubulointerstitial disease [124 (6.7%)] and vascular disease [60 (3.2%)] were less common. End-stage changes and miscellaneous disease were found in 37 (2%) and 13 (0.7%) cases, respectively. The incidence of FSGS and IgAN has been increasing since 1999. This study provides descriptive biopsy data and highlights the changing incidence of renal disease which is probably contributed by an increase referral due to increased awareness together with increased manpower and infrastructure.",

        "Abstract":"BACKGROUND: Due to poverty, many countries of sub-Saharan Africa suffer a severe burden of end-stage renal disease (ESRD), the cause of which is often unidentified. We sought to identify biopsy-proven causes of ESRD in Cape Town, South Africa, and to determine the outcome of these patients.\nMETHODS: Records of biopsies reported as ESRD over a 10-year period were selected for analysis. The demographic, clinical and biochemical characteristics of the patients at the time of biopsy were documented. The decision of the committee that assesses the eligibility of patients for long-term renal replacement therapy (RRT) was documented, and if a patient was not accepted the reasons for the rejection were noted.\nRESULTS: Chronic glomerulonephritis (CGN) was the most frequent cause of ESRD (31.2%); human immunodeficiency virus-associated nephropathy (HIVAN) accounted for 12.5% of ESRD cases. Sixty-six patients (45.8%) were never reviewed by the assessment committee for placement in the dialysis program. Of the remaining 78 patients (54.2%) reviewed for RRT, only 48\/78 (61.5%) were selected. A higher frequency of patients with HIVAN were not accepted for RRT (17.7%) than patients with HIVAN who were accepted (2.1%) (p=0.008). Social factors such as lack of housing, alcohol abuse, illicit drug abuse, lack of transportation and lack of family\/social support accounted for 56.7% of patients not being accepted for RRT.\nCONCLUSION: There needs to be a development of programs amongst Africans to provide effective solutions that tackle the burden of ESRD, especially related to the increasing prevalence of HIVAN.",

        "Abstract":"AIMS: The long-term prognosis for adults with acute postinfectious glomerulonephritis (APIGN) is under debate. This study was designed to investigate the long-term renal outcome of adult APIGN.\nMATERIALS AND METHODS: A total of 64 adults with APIGN were identified and divided into two groups: acute poststreptococcal glomerulonephritis (APSGN) group and acute nonstreptococcal postinfectious glomerulonephritis (nonstreptococcal APIGN) group. For the purpose of outcome analysis, 49 patients with a follow-up of ≥ 12 months were included. Univariate and multivariate analyses were performed for prognostic factors.\nRESULTS: Nephrotic syndrome was more frequently seen in nonstreptococcal APIGN patients. At the time of biopsy, the mean proteinuria of the two groups was 1.82 ± 2.14 and 4.21 ± 4.39 g\/d, respectively (p = 0.005). There was no significant difference between the two groups on microscopy. Among the 49 patients with ≥ 12 months of follow-up, the complete remission rate was 85.7%, and the incidence of chronic renal failure and endstage renal disease (ESRD) was 6.1% and 4.1%, respectively. The complete remission rate of the APSGN group was higher than that of the nonstreptococcal APIGN group. Univariate analysis showed that the prognostic factors were age, underlying disease, proteinuria, tubular damage and C1q deposits. In multivariate analysis, underlying disease was the only significant and independent inverse correlate of complete remission.\nCONCLUSIONS: The long-term prognosis for young Chinese adults with APIGN is optimistic if there is no underlying disease. The renal outcome for patients with APSGN is better than for patients with nonstreptococcal APIGN.",

Our study was conducted to assess clinical symptoms and histological diagnoses in patients with diabetes mellitus Type 1 and Type 2 undergoing kidney biopsy.\nDESIGN, SETTING AND PATIENTS: Observational study. The study included data from 567 consecutive renal biopsies of patients with diabetes mellitus Type 1 or 2 and chronic kidney disease (CKD) examined by standard histopathological procedures. The main outcome measures were incidence of diabetic nephropathy (DN) and glomerulonephritis (GN), predictors for the presence of both DN or GN.\nRESULTS: Approximately 70% of patients with diabetes mellitus Type 1 or 2 and evidence for CKD had DN. Glomerular diseases present in approximately 30% of patients with diabetes were predominantly immune complex GN and secondary focal glomerulosclerosis, followed by IgA-GN, which was associated with microhematuria (p = 0.01) and hypertension (p = 0.04). Only a minority had membranous GN, which was associated with nephrotic syndrome (p = 0.004). Progressive CKD predicted the presence of GN in diabetes mellitus Type 2 (r = -0.98; p = 0.02).\nCONCLUSION: GN is not uncommon in patients with diabetes and evidence for CKD. Kidney biopsy should therefore be considered in patients with diabetes and progressive CKD.",

The main justification for this procedure is to diagnose early and presumably modifiable acute and chronic renal allograft injury. Pediatric recipients are theoretically at increased risk for subclinical renal allograft injury due to their relatively large adult-sized kidneys and their higher degree of immunological responsiveness. The safety profile of this procedure has been well investigated. Patient morbidity is low, with macroscopic hematuria being the most common adverse event. No patient deaths have been attributed to this procedure. Longitudinal surveillance biopsy studies have revealed a substantial burden of subclinical immunological and non-immunological injury, including acute cellular rejection, interstitial fibrosis and tubular atrophy, microvascular lesions and transplant glomerulopathy. The main impediment to the implementation of surveillance biopsies as the standard of care is the lack of demonstrable benefit of early histological detection on long-term outcome. The considerable debate surrounding this issue highlights the need for multicenter, prospective, and randomized studies.",

        "Abstract":"BACKGROUND: Despite recent advances in the management of lupus nephritis (LN), these unfortunate patients are at a higher risk of developing chronic kidney disease (CKD). Concomitant chronic hepatitis C virus (HCV) infection is associated with adverse outcome in patients with LN and further compounds the risk as some of these patients choose to undergo kidney transplantation in the near future. Objectives. The aim of the present study is to evaluate the long-term impact of chronic HCV infection in patients with underlying Class IV LN on renal function, progression to end-stage renal disease (ESRD) and patient survival.\nMETHODS: Retrospective analysis of the medical records of 134 nondialysis-dependent patients with biopsy-proven World Health Organization Class IV LN with chronic HCV infection was done from January 1995 to January 2008 at King Khalid University Hospital, Riyadh, Saudi Arabia. Primary and the secondary end points were death or the development of ESRD. The patients were followed over a period of 6.7 ± 3.3 (1-14.4) years.\nRESULTS: From a total of 134 biopsy-proven Class IV LN patients, 15 (11.2%) patients were HCV positive of which 2 (13.3%) patients were male and 13 (86.7%) patients were female. One hundred and nineteen (88.8%) patients were HCV negative of which 17 (14.3%) were male and 102 (85.7%) were female. The mean age was 32.47 ± 11.8 years. Eight (53.3%) patients in the HCV-positive group versus 19 (22.6%) patients in the HCV-negative group progressed to severe renal impairment with serum creatinine >350 μmol\/L (P = 0.024). A total of 8 (53.3%) patients in the HCV-positive group versus 18 (17.3%) in HCV-negative group progressed to ESRD (P = 0.005). The mean creatinine clearance was higher (43.3 ± 33 mL\/min) in the HCV-negative LN group at last follow-up than in the HCV-positive patients (25 ± 34.9 mL\/min) with a statistically significant P-value of 0.0463. Five patients (33.3%) with HCV-positive LN died in comparison to eight (7.6%) patients who were HCV negative P = 0.03; however, the cause of hospital mortality was mainly cardiovascular disease (CVD) and infection and none of the patients died of chronic liver disease, although there was significant deterioration of the liver function at the end of the study. Kaplan-Meier survival estimates showed a significantly inferior renal function and rapid deterioration to ESRD in LN patients with concomitant HCV infection, with a dialysis free survival of 95 and 80% for the HCV-negative group and 90 and 65% for the HCV-positive groups at the end of 5 and 10 years respectively, with a highly significant P-value of <0.05 at the end of 10 years.\nCONCLUSION: The present study highlights that concomitant HCV infection in patients with LN is associated with worse renal outcome, higher rate of progression to ESRD and reduced patient survival.",

Recently, the International IgA Nephropathy Network has developed the Oxford classification in which four histological variables with the most prognostic importance are identified (MEST score). Our objective was to validate these findings and to assess their predictive power in our cohort and to compare them to identified clinical predictors.\nMETHODS: Ninety-nine children with a follow-up time >5 years were included and investigated with clearances of inulin or iohexol for glomerular filtration rate (GFR), proteinuria and blood pressure at biopsy and during follow-up. Biopsies (90\/99) were re-evaluated and scored according to the Oxford classification.\nRESULTS: Eighteen patients progressed to a poor outcome [end-stage renal disease (ESRD) or GFR reduction >50%]. In the univariate analysis, we found that mesangial hypercellullarity score >0.5, presence of endocapillary hypercellularity or tubular atrophy\/interstitial fibrosis of >25% were each associated with a poor outcome, and also presence of cellular or fibrocellular crescents and of global glomerulosclerosis, but segmental glomerulosclerosis did not reach statistical significance. The clinical predictors of a poor outcome were a low GFR, a high mean arterial blood pressure and a high amount of albuminuria (log Ualb\/c) at time of biopsy and low GFR and a high log Ualb\/c during follow-up.\nCONCLUSION: We found that three of the four histology lesions identified in the Oxford classification, as well as presence of crescents, were valid in predicting a poor outcome in our cohort of patients.",

        "Abstract":"BACKGROUND: Higher rates of acute rejection (AR) and reduced graft survival have been reported in patients with cytomegalovirus (CMV) infection, but an association between these factors remains controversial.\nMETHODS: In this study, serial protocol biopsies (PBs) and clinically indicated biopsies (IBs) from a large cohort of renal allograft recipients (n &frac14; 594) were analyzed to examine the relation between CMV and AR.\nRESULTS: Patients with CMV were more likely to receive IB (85 of the 153 patients; 56%) compared to patients without CMV (138 of 441 patients; 32%; P = 0.003). However, this did not translate into a greater number of patients with episodes of acute cellular rejection on histopathology in IBs. Analysis of PBs revealed a significantly higher number of episodes of rejection per patient with CMV infection (P = 0.04), but only in a subgroup of patients with triple immunosuppression. Long-term graft function post-transplantation was analyzed in four different subgroups according to CMV infection and\/or AR. Differences in renal function were apparent within the first 6 weeks after transplantation and persisted during follow-up, with the best renal function in patients without AR or CMV, whereas patients with both AR and CMV had the worst (P < 0.012 at 1 year; P < 0.001 at 2 years). On average, the latter group had significantly older donors and more often delayed graft function.\nCONCLUSIONS: Our data suggests that the link between CMV and AR is far less significant than previously thought.

It is characterized by symptoms including nonthrombocytopenic purpura, abdominal pain, haematuria\/proteinuria, and arthralgia\/arthritis. The pleiomorphism of clinical signs in HSP could be confused with other conditions or other vasculitis forms.\nOBJECTIVE: Evaluation of HSP clinical presentation, the onset and severity of renal manifestation in affected children and their outcome.\nMETHODS: A retrospective study of 49 patients diagnosed with HSP was conducted from September 1999 to September 2009. Children with severe renal manifestations (nephrotic range proteinuria, with or without nephrotic or nephritic syndrome) have undergone kidney biopsy.\nRESULTS: Twenty-five patients developed renal manifestations after onset of the disease. In our study child's older age was a risk factor for association with HSP nephritis. Six of the patients required kidney biopsy. They were successfully treated with various immunosuppressive protocols, as well as three of nine patients with nephrotic range proteinuria. Two patients developed most severe form of HSP nephritis, nephrotic-nephritic syndrome with histology grade IIIb\/IVb. During the study period (average followup 6 years), all patients had a normal global renal function with mild proteinuria in only two cases. The prognosis of renal involvement was better than reports from other patient series.\nCONCLUSION: Long-term morbidity of HSP is predominantly attributed to renal involvement. During the study period, no patient had renal insufficiency or end stage renal disease after various combinations of immunosuppressive treatment. It is recommended that patients with HSP nephritis are followed for longer periods of time with a regular measurement of renal function and proteinuria.",

        "Abstract":"Renal osteodystrophy occurs early during loss of kidney function. There are 26 million American patients with chronic kidney disease (CKD), and almost all patients with CKD stage 5 have abnormal bone histology. Six hundred and thirty bone biopsies from adult CKD-5 patients on dialysis were evaluated by histomorphometry and analyzed using the turnover (T), mineralization (M), and volume (V) classification. There were racial differences; whites exhibited predominantly low turnover (62%), whereas blacks showed mostly normal or high turnover (68%). A mineralization defect was observed in only 3% of patients. In whites, cancellous bone volume was low, normal, or high in approximately the same number of patients, whereas in blacks, cancellous bone volume was high in two-thirds of the patients. More than 80% of blacks and whites with low cancellous bone volume had thin trabeculae owing to low bone formation. Cortical thickness was low in half the whites, whereas it was normal in three-quarters of blacks. Cortical porosity was high in 50% of whites, whereas three-quarters of blacks had high porosity. In summary, the TMV system gives relevant information. It should be expanded to include the architecture of cancellous and cortical bone. There are racial differences. Low bone volume and low bone turnover are more frequent than heretofore appreciated, whereas mineralization defects nowadays are observed rarely in adults. These findings call for an adjustment of the current therapeutic paradigm that takes into consideration race and risk of low bone volume and turnover. The latter have been shown to be associated with increased vascular calcifications.",

The authors report a 2-year-old boy who had suffered from steroid-resistant nephrotic syndrome. Renal biopsy showed diffuse and severe vacuolization of glomerular and tubular epithelial cells. The vacuoles were ultrastructurally membrane bound, most of which were not empty but contained electron-dense material lining the inner surface of the membrane. The pathologic changes were consistent with neuraminidase-deficient disorders, which was later confirmed by biochemical analysis. Although rare, nephrosialidosis should be considered in children with steroid-resistant nephrotic syndrome if renal biopsies exhibit severe vacuolar degeneration of renal epithelial cells.",

        "Abstract":"INTRODUCTION: The elderly population is growing and aging in better clinical conditions than in the past. However, the distribution and course of kidney diseases in elderly patients are not well known partially due to reluctance to indicate renal biopsies in those patients.\nOBJECTIVE: To evaluate the distribution, clinical features, and outcomes of nephropathies diagnosed by biopsy in the elderly.\nPATIENTS AND METHODS: Seventy-one patients (47 males, 24 females) aged 60 years or older (67.3 ± 6.5 years), undergoing biopsy from January 1990 to December 2006, were evaluated. They were grouped according to their clinical syndromes.\nRESULTS: Nephrotic syndrome was observed in 35 patients (49.3%), mainly associated with membranous nephropathy (17 patients), followed by amyloidosis and focal segmental glomerulosclerosis (seven patients each). Acute kidney injury (AKI) was diagnosed in 19 patients, and the main histopathological diagnoses were acute tubular necrosis (six patients) and cast nephropathy (three patients). Of those 19 patients, only two had a favorable course, while the others died early or progressed toward advanced chronic kidney disease. Twelve patients undergoing biopsy because of asymptomatic hematuria or proteinuria had different diagnoses, but most of them already had significant chronic nephropathy. In five patients with nephritic syndrome, the biopsies also showed several diagnoses.\nCONCLUSIONS: Nephrotic syndrome was the major indication for renal biopsy, and membranous nephropathy was the most frequent diagnosis. Among patients with AKI and asymptomatic hematuria or proteinuria, different diagnoses were found with high levels of advanced chronic nephropathy.",

We analyzed the clinical and pathological diagnoses registered on the J-RBR in 2007 and 2008.\nRESULTS: Data were collected from 818 patients from 18 centers in 2007 and 1582 patients from 23 centers in 2008, including the affiliated hospitals. Renal biopsies were obtained from 726 native kidneys (88.8%) and 92 renal grafts (11.2%) in 2007, and 1400 native kidneys (88.5%) and 182 renal grafts (11.5%) in 2008. The most common clinical diagnosis was chronic nephritic syndrome (47.4%), followed by nephrotic syndrome (16.8%) and renal transplantation (11.2%) in 2007. A similar frequency of the clinical diagnoses was recognized in 2008. Of the native kidneys, the most frequent pathological diagnosis as classified by pathogenesis was immunoglobulin (Ig) A nephropathy (IgAN) both in 2007 (32.9%) and 2008 (30.2%). Among the primary glomerular diseases (except IgAN), membranous nephropathy (MN) was the most common disease both in 2007 (31.4%) and 2008 (25.7%).\nCONCLUSIONS: In a cross-sectional study, the J-RBR has shown IgAN to be the most common disease in renal biopsies in 2007 and 2008, consistent with previous Japanese studies. MN predominated in the primary glomerular diseases (except for IgAN). The frequency of the disease and the clinical and demographic correlations should be investigated in further analyses by the J-RBR.",

The biopsy was systematically done for patients who were candidates for elective NP. The criteria for elective indications NP tumors were less than 4cm, low grade Fuhrman (I and II). The tubulopapillary tumors (TBP) on biopsy were excluded from the elective indications. The parameters studied were the biopsy data, overall survival, disease-free survival.\nRESULTS: The median age was 59 years (32-79 years) and 69% of tumor were fortuitous discovery. Indications of need accounted for 30% of cases (single kidney, bilateral tumors and chronic renal failure [CRF]). Biopsy allowed a diagnosis in 89% of cases.

The aim of this study was the evaluation of the frequency of the different kidney diseases, their clinical presentation and the demographic features of the population based on renal biopsies performed at our center during the years 2000-2008. Clinical presentations were defined as nephrotic syndrome (NS), urinary abnormalities, macroscopic hematuria, acute renal failure (ARF) and chronic renal failure (CRF). Kidney diseases were divided into five groups: 1) primary glomerulonephritis; 2) secondary glomerulonephritis; 3) tubulointerstitial nephritis (TIN); 4) vascular-disease-associated kidney disease; 5) miscellaneous. Primary glomerulonephritis was the most common (58.64%), followed by secondary glomerulonephritis (27.03%); TIN and vascular diseases were diagnosed in 1.46% and 7.78% of cases, respectively. The most common indications to perform renal biopsies were urinary abnormalities in 45.01% of cases, followed by CRF (21.51%) and NS (21.37%); macroscopic hematuria (6.41%) and ARF (5.70%) were less common. The most common kidney disease in men was IgA nephropathy (27.91%), while lupus nephritis was the most common in women (18.88%). In patients older than 65 years of age membranous glomerulonephritis (34.67%) was the most common kidney disease. The availability of these data is useful to assess the distribution and clinical presentation of kidney diseases among patients hospitalized at the Policlinico Umberto I in Rome.",

The authors present a case of acute renal failure in a 56-year-old male renal allograft recipient with the combination of postbiopsy AVF and TRAS. At first, the authors performed percutaneous angioplasty with stent implantation for the TRAS, but the AVF gradually enlarged. Eighteen months later, the patient began to experience hypertension, and his serum creatinine level increased; he received transcatheter arterial embolization therapy for enlarged AVF, and his renal function returned to baseline level.",

        "Abstract":"Different donor parameters and baseline biopsy have been used to assess the quality of donor organs. There is, however, no consensus which risk factors and chronic changes in the donor kidney can be accepted for transplantation. The study included 481 deceased organ donors and their 829 kidney recipients transplanted during 1995-2005. The biopsies were re-evaluated according to the Banff 97 classification. The prognostic significance of donor risk factors and Chronic Allograft Damage Index (CADI) was analyzed. We propose a new donor risk score, calculated as the count of positive risk factors from a defined set of factors in the medical history of the donor. This donor risk score predicts histological quality of the kidney, graft function, and survival. Transplantations from donors with donor risk score >4 had significantly decreased graft survival compared to those with donor risk scores 0-4; the five-yr death-censored graft survivals were 83% vs. 93%, respectively. High donor CADI score (>3) was associated with worse graft function and survival. Three-yr glomerular filtration rate declined from 82 to 49 mL\/min with donor CADI increase from 0 to ≥4. Our results show that high donor risk score and CADI value reflect low functional reserve and risk for poor graft outcome.",

        "Abstract":"CONTEXT: Renal interstitial fibrosis and, to a lesser extent, sclerotic glomeruli correlate with poor renal function. However, not all nonfunctional glomeruli are sclerotic. Many or most glomeruli with periglomerular fibrosis, while retaining blood flow, probably do not filter; therefore, they may not contribute to renal function.\nOBJECTIVE: To examine the relationship of periglomerular fibrosis and the sum of globally sclerotic glomeruli and glomeruli with periglomerular fibrosis (GSG+PF) with interstitial fibrosis and renal function.\nDESIGN: Native kidney biopsies from 177 patients with chronic renal injury were assessed for interstitial fibrosis, glomerular sclerosis, and GSG+PF. Renal biopsies with active or acute lesions were not included. The percentage of globally sclerotic glomeruli and GSG+PF was correlated with the degree of interstitial fibrosis and serum creatinine levels.\nRESULTS: The percentage of GSG+PF correlates better with the degree of interstitial fibrosis and renal function than does the percentage of globally sclerotic glomeruli alone. This appears particularly true in chronic renal diseases of patients without diabetes. The number of globally sclerotic glomeruli correlates better with interstitial fibrosis and renal function than does the sum of globally and segmentally sclerotic glomeruli.\nCONCLUSIONS: The percentage of GSG+PF in a renal biopsy specimen provides a better estimate of chronic renal injury than does the percentage of sclerotic glomeruli alone, probably because many or most glomeruli with periglomerular fibrosis are nonfunctional. Therefore, we recommend that the number of glomeruli with periglomerular fibrosis also be provided in the renal biopsy report.",

Bleeding diathesis, liver disease, and obesity are common contraindications for percutaneous renal biopsy. In high-risk patients, transjugular renal biopsy is believed to be a safe and effective procedure. This study reports the experience of an academic interventional nephrology program with performing transjugular renal biopsy. We performed a retrospective observational study of 23 patients with either acute or chronic kidney disease with contraindications for percutaneous renal biopsy. All transjugular renal biopsies were performed by interventional nephrologists at our university. We studied the efficacy and safety of transjugular renal biopsy in these patients. Twenty out of 23 (87%) of the procedures yielded adequate tissue for pathologic diagnosis. Three (13%) patients required blood transfusions, none required coil embolization or nephrectomy, and there were no deaths. Even though performing transjugular renal biopsy requires considerable technical expertise and must be performed in an interventional radiology suite, it can be safely and effectively performed by well-trained interventional nephrologists to achieve pathological diagnosis.",

Renal biopsy is a valuable tool to provide histological evidence. However, the safety in patients with type 2 diabetes receiving renal biopsy is not well evaluated. This study was conducted to monitor the dynamic complications and to evaluate the safety of biopsy in diabetic patients.\nMETHODS: A prospective observation was performed on 130 patients with type 2 diabetes and 150 patients not undergoing renal biopsy. The complications were monitored at 4 h, 8 h, 24 h, 48 h and 72 h sequentially after biopsy.\nRESULTS: Haematoma was observed in 34 (26.15%) patients with diabetes and 50 (33.33%) in controls (P=0.19). The timing of large haematoma peaked at 4 h. Gross haematuria occurred in 12 (9.23%) diabetic patients and eight (5.33%) controls (P=0.207). It happened mainly within 8 h. Renal pathological diagnosis showed 96 (73.85%) cases with diabetic nephropathy and 34 (26.15%) cases with non-diabetic renal disease.\nCONCLUSION: Renal biopsy in patients with type 2 diabetes is safe. The frequency of complications after renal biopsy in diabetes is no higher than those without diabetes. The complications mostly happened within 8 h, especially within 4 h.

A 55-year-old man presented with non-fluent aphasia, fever, neck stiffness and disturbance of consciousness. Twenty-one years previously, the patient had undergone kidney transplantation for chronic renal failure. Brain MRI revealed multiple lesions in the bilateral cerebrum, right cerebellum and medulla oblongata. The brain biopsy showed EBV-positive lymphocytes infiltrating into the subarachnoid and Virchow-Robins space. The diagnosis of PTLD was made and the patient received a reduction in immunosuppressants. However, the patient died of massive bleeding from a rectal ulcer 3 months after the onset. An autopsy conducted 1 month after the biopsy revealed a diffuse large B-cell lymphoma at the biopsy site and extracranial PTLD lesions. Moreover, a human cytomegalovirus infection involving the rectum, pancreas, trachea and bladder was confirmed. Comparisons with past cases clarified the characteristics of this case, in particular, the clinicopathological involvement of leptomeninges. In addition, there have so far been only a limited number of such reports demonstrating detailed pathological findings, including both biopsy and autopsy findings. We herein describe the relationship between clinical and pathological findings and demonstrate the way CNS PTLD lesion progresses.",

The cause remains unknown. To date, all efforts to investigate skin Gd concentrations in patients with NSF have been performed on paraffin-embedded samples, and Gd deposition has not been correlated with disease activity by a statistically significant analysis.\nOBJECTIVE: We sought to: (1) quantify Gd concentration in fresh tissue skin biopsy specimens; (2) quantify and compare synchronous Gd concentration of affected skin and unaffected skin in patients with NSF (n = 13) with a control group (n = 13); and (3) quantify serum Gd.\nMETHODS: We used inductively coupled plasma mass spectrometry.\nRESULTS: In patients with NSF, the mean ratio of paired Gd concentrations of affected skin to unaffected skin was 23.1, ranging from 1.2 to 88.9. Mean serum Gd concentrations in patients with NSF were 4.8 ng\/mL, which is more than 10 times the level in control patients. A statistically significant correlation existed between serum and affected skin Gd concentrations (r(2) = .74, P < .0001).\nLIMITATIONS: Because of the feasibility of this study, the main limitation was the small sample size (n = 13 affected and 13 control).\nCONCLUSIONS: Determination of Gd concentrations in fresh skin samples and serum using inductively coupled plasma mass spectrometry demonstrates significant differences in the amounts of Gd in involved versus nonlesional skin of patients with NSF. This supports the role of differential free Gd deposition from Gd-based contrast in the pathogenesis of NSF.",

        "Abstract":"BACKGROUND: The patterns of glomerular diseases have been widely reported from different regional and national biopsy registries worldwide. However, there are scant studies on the epidemiology of biopsy-proven renal disease, particularly glomerular diseases in sub-Saharan Africa.\nMETHODS: We retrospectively analysed the reports of 1284 native renal biopsies, reviewed by the same pathologist and performed at the Groote Schuur Hospital in Cape Town from 1 January 2000 to 31 December 2009.\nRESULTS: The mean age of all the patients biopsied was 36.8 ± 14.0 years with 61.8% of the patients being under 40 years of age. There was a preponderance of females (54.8%). There were more coloured patients (53.7%) than blacks (42.2%) or whites (3.9%). The frequencies of clinical indications for a renal biopsy were nephrotic range proteinuria (52.5%), acute renal failure (21.3%), asymptomatic urinary abnormalities (13.6%), chronic renal failure (6.4%), acute nephritic syndrome (5.8%) and haematuria (0.3%). The frequencies of the primary glomerulonephritis (GN) include mesangiocapillary GN (20.4%), mesangial proliferative GN (19.2%), membranous GN (18.5%), crescentic and necrotizing GN (11.4%), focal and segmental glomerulosclerosis (10.5%), post-infectious GN (8.2%), minimal change disease (6.0%) and IgA nephropathy (5.8%). Lupus nephritis was the most frequent secondary glomerular disease (39.0%) and was also the most frequent cause of the nephrotic range proteinuria (17.2%). HIV-associated nephropathy increased from 6.6% in 2000 to 25.7% in 2009 (P < 0.0001).\nCONCLUSION: Our data are an important contribution to the epidemiology of renal disease in Africa. We hope that this will form the basis for developing a renal biopsy registry in South Africa and across the continent.",

We report the results of 105 renal biopsies from 101 nonrenal transplant recipients (bone marrow 14, liver 41, lung 30, heart 20). Biopsy indications were protracted acute renal failure (9%), creatinine increases (83%), heavy proteinuria (22%), or renal insufficiency before re-transplantation (9%). Histological findings other than nonspecific chronic changes, hypertension-related damage, and signs of chronic CNI toxicity included primary glomerular disease (17%), mostly after liver transplantation (21%) or after bone marrow transplantation (29%), and thrombotic microangiopathy (TMA) namely (10%). TMA had the most serious impact on the clinical course. Besides severe hypertension, one TMA patient died of cerebral hemorrhage, 5 had hemolytic-uremic syndrome, and 6 rapidly developed end-stage renal failure. TMA patients had the shortest kidney survival post-biopsy and, together with patients with acute tubular injury, the shortest kidney and patient survival since transplantation. Nine TMA patients had received CNI, 3 of them concomitantly received an mTOR-inhibitor. CNI toxicity is implicated in most patients with renal failure after transplant of other organs and may play a role in the development of TMA, the most serious complication. However, decreased renal function should not be routinely ascribed to CNI.",

All patients fulfilled the 1997 revised criteria for the classification of SLE. White patients (Spanish-born) with biopsy-proven LN were selected as the study population.The cohort included 190 patients (170 female patients and 20 male) with a mean age at LN diagnosis of 31 years. Renal biopsy revealed type I LN in 8 (4%) patients, type II in 33 (17%), type III in 46 (24%), type IV in 72 (38%), type V in 28 (15%), and type VI in 3 (2%) patients. Induction remission was achieved in 85% of patients with types I and II, 78% with type III, 70% with type IV, and 32% of patients with type V. After a mean follow-up of 2391 patient-years, 62 (33%) patients developed chronic renal failure and 18 (9%) evolved to end-stage renal disease. Adjusted multivariate Cox regression analysis identified male sex (hazard ratio [HR], 4.33) and elevated creatinine at LN diagnosis (HR, 5.18) as independent variables for renal failure. Survival was 92% at 10 years of follow-up, 80% after 20 years, and 72% after 30 years.Our results suggest that biopsy-proven LN in white patients has an excellent prognosis. Ethnicity should be considered a key factor when evaluating the prognosis and therapeutic response to different agents in patients with LN.",

The renal Fanconi syndrome occurs in the first year of life and is accompanied by a characteristic \"swan neck\" deformity of the proximal renal tubule. The linkage between cystine storage, Fanconi syndrome, and renal failure has not been understood. This study reports the presence of substantial numbers of atubular glomeruli (ATG) in end-stage cystinotic renal tissue. Compared to normal renal tissue, cystinotic kidneys at end stage had 69% atubular glomeruli and 30% atrophic glomeruli. Normal renal tissue had 4% ATG and 0% atrophic glomeruli (p<0.0001 for both comparisons). These nonfunctioning nephrons may be the end result of cell loss from the tubules and represent the final stage of the swan neck deformity.

        "Abstract":"BACKGROUND AND OBJECTIVES: The United States Renal Data System (USRDS) is a commonly utilized database for epidemiologic research of ESRD patients. USRDS uses Medical Evidence Form 2728 to collect medical information about ESRD patients. The validity of the Form 2728 \"primary cause of renal failure\" field for glomerular diseases has not been evaluated, although inconsistencies between Form 2728 information and medical records have been documented previously with respect to comorbidities.\nDESIGN, SETTING, PARTICIPANTS, & MEASUREMENTS: Form 2728 information was linked with renal biopsy results from the Glomerular Disease Collaborative Network (GDCN) for 217 patients with biopsy-confirmed glomerular diseases who had reached ESRD. Biopsy results were compared with the Form 2728 \"primary cause of renal failure\" field. Diseases were considered individually, and also categorized into commonly used disease groups. Percentage of agreement and disease-specific measures of validity were calculated.\nRESULTS: Overall agreement between renal biopsy and Form 2728 was low (14.8% overall, 23.0% when categorized). Agreement was better after Form 2728 was revised in 1995 (10.0% before versus 23.2% after overall). The cause of ESRD field was left blank in 57% of the forms submitted for glomerular disease patients. Individual glomerular diseases had very low specificities, but tended to have high positive predictive values.\nCONCLUSIONS: Form 2728 does not accurately reflect the renal pathology diagnosis as captured by biopsy. The large degree of missing data and misclassification should be of concern to those performing epidemiologic research using Form 2728 information on glomerular diseases.",

There is controversy regarding which tests are necessary and whether renal biopsy is indicated. In the pediatric population, renal biopsy should be considered if there is evidence of progressive renal disease or when parents are worried about their child's diagnosis or prognosis. In adults, examinations for isolated microhematuria should include exclusion of pharmacological causes, journeys to endemic areas for S. haematobium or tuberculosis, sickle-cell disease, endometriosis and, in patients older than 40 years, kidney, ureteral or bladder cancer. Examination of urinary sediment may help in identifying the origin of microhematuria.

The thyroid glands of 143 patients with end-stage renal disease on hemodialysis were examined by ultrasonography using frequency probes. Although a goiter (thyroid volume > 20 mL) was observed in only 20 patients (14%), nodular lesions of the thyroid gland were more frequent and found in 85 patients (59.4%), especially in female patients (42 patients, 72.4%). The etiology of thyroid nodular lesions was as follows: cyst in 43 (30.0%), adenomatous goiter in 14 (9.8%), adenoma in 11 (7.7%), hypoechoic lesion in 17 (11.9%), and intrathyroid calcification in 8 (5.6%). Ultrasound-guided fine-needle aspiration cytology was performed in 5 patients, but no abnormal cells were found. Compared to patients without nodules, the age was higher in patients with cysts (54 +\/- 15 vs. 63 +\/- 13 years; P < 0.05) and hypoechoic lesions (70 +\/- 13 years; P < 0.05). The serum thyroglobulin level was higher in patients with adenomatous goiters (26 +\/- 28 vs. 148 +\/- 166 ng\/mL; P < 0.05).

To evaluate the underlying mechanism(s) of this clinical observation we obtained biopsy specimens of fundic mucosa from two groups of patients with variable renal function (group 1 normal renal function (n = 8); group 2 renal insufficiency (n = 8), CL(CR) < 20 mL\/min) [matched for age and sex]. Furthermore, we investigated the effect of intact parathyroid hormone (PTH (1-84)), urea and calcium on 14C-aminopyrine uptake as an indicator of acid secretion. Gastric mucosal cells from human biopsies were isolated by pronase and collagenase digestion. Cyclic AMP content of parietal cells was determined by radioimmunoassay. Histamine and calcium stimulated 14C-aminopyrine uptake. PTH (1-84) suppressed basal 14C-aminopyrine accumulation, whereas addition of urea had no influence either in presence or in absence of histamine. In contrast to histamine, PTH (1-84) did not induce a significant increase in cellular cyclic AMP. In conclusion, there is no difference in the activation of 14C-aminopyrine uptake between patients with normal renal function and renal insufficiency except lower basal values in patients with renal failure. This could be caused by PTH (1-84) and urea which inhibit gastric acid secretion. Only calcium is the important agent causing an increase in the sensitivity of parietal cells in hyperparathyroidism.",

The present study investigated whether previous preeclampsia was associated with progression of established kidney disease. Material and methods. Data from the Norwegian Kidney Biopsy Registry and the Medical Birth Registry of Norway were linked. We included women who, after their last pregnancy, had had a representative kidney biopsy in 1988-2005. Women were followed up for the development of ESRD using data from the Norwegian Renal Registry. Baseline was set at the time of biopsy and Cox regression statistics were performed.\nRESULTS: Of the 582 included women, 76 developed ESRD 3.9 ± 3.4 years (range, 0.08-16 years) after diagnosis. Mean age at first birth was 24.0 ± 4.8 years and at the time of diagnosis 41.3 ± 9.7 years. Women with clinically diagnosed preeclampsia in their first pregnancy had a relative risk of ESRD of 1.2 (95% CI, 0.63-2.4) and women with preterm birth had a relative risk of 2.1 (95% CI, 1.2-3.9). After extensive adjustments for clinical and histopathological variables at the time of diagnosis, the relative risks were 1.1 (95% CI, 0.50-2.6) and 2.4 (95% CI, 1.2-4.6), respectively. Compared to women with a first term birth without preeclampsia, women with term preeclampsia were diagnosed at a younger age (36 vs 42 years) and women with preterm birth without preeclampsia had a lower estimated glomerular filtration rate at diagnosis (48 vs 64 ml\/min\/1.73 m(2)).\nCONCLUSION: In women with kidney disease diagnosed at kidney biopsy, previous preeclampsia does not seem to be a risk marker for progression to ESRD.",

        "Abstract":"The most common cause of kidney transplant failure is the poorly characterized histopathologic entity interstitial fibrosis and tubular atrophy (IFTA). There are no known unifying mechanisms, no effective therapy, and no proven preventive strategies. Possible mechanisms include chronic immune rejection, inflammation, drug toxicity, and chronic kidney injury from secondary factors. To gain further mechanistic insight, we conducted a large-scale proteogenomic study of kidney transplant biopsies with IFTA of varying severity. We acquired proteomic data using tandem mass spectrometry with subsequent quantification, analysis of differential protein expression, validation, and functional annotations to known molecular networks. We performed genome-wide expression profiling in parallel. More than 1400 proteins with unique expression profiles traced the progression from normal transplant biopsies to biopsies with mild to moderate and severe disease. Multiple sets of proteins were mapped to different functional pathways, many increasing with histologic severity, including immune responses, inflammatory cell activation, and apoptosis consistent with the chronic rejection hypothesis. Two examples include the extensive population of the alternative rather than the classical complement pathway, previously not appreciated for IFTA, and a comprehensive control network for the actin cytoskeleton and cell signaling of the acute-phase response. In summary, this proteomic effort using kidney tissue contributes mechanistic insight into several biologic processes associated with IFTA.",

        "Abstract":"BACKGROUND: The usefulness of the combination of technetium-99m-methoxyisobutylisonitrile (99mTc-MIBI) parathyroid scintigraphy and ultrasonography to detect parathyroid glands (PTGs) in secondary hyperparathyroidism (SHPT) is still controversial.\nMETHODS: In all, 21 patients with SHPT underwent parathyroidectomy. The sensitivity and specificity of ultrasonography and scintigraphy related to site, size, hyperplasia type of PTG, concomitant thyroid disease, and the frequency of intraoperative frozen sections were determined.\nRESULTS: The sensitivities of scintigraphy and ultrasonography were 62% and 55%, and the specificity was 95% for both procedures. The sensitivity of combined techniques was 73%. The scintigraphy detected 7\/9 (78%) ectopic PTGs, whereas ultrasonography was always negative. A PTG maximum longitudinal diameter <8 mm, the presence of diffuse hyperplasia, the upper localization of glands, and the presence of concomitant thyroid disease reduced the sensitivity and specificity of imaging techniques. In cases of positive imaging, the rate of intraoperative frozen sections was significantly lower.\nCONCLUSIONS: The ultrasonography and sestamibi scintigraphy, which showed a higher sensitivity than that of either ultrasonography or scintigraphy alone, led to a reduction of intraoperative frozen sections and to preoperative diagnosis of ectopic (29%) or supernumerary PTGs (10%) and concomitant nodular thyroid disease (24%).",

It is authentically shown that the severity of sclerotic processes (both segmental and global sclerosis) depends on the morphological changes only in patients aged 31 to 45 years. In this same group we identified the dependence of expression of hypertrophy of arteries and arterioles of kidney tissue from other morphological changes.

This is the largest series of such subjects (to our knowledge) from a single center. Sixty-four percent of the patients recovered without any long-term sequelae. Three patients developed chronic kidney disease, 1 developed end-stage renal failure, and 1 died in the acute phase. The greatest risk factor for the development of chronic kidney disease is the need for acute dialysis for >20 days, and death in the acute phase is rare unless meningitis is the primary infection.",

A total of 424 biopsies were conducted in a cohort of 158 patients; of these biopsies, 158 were in the third week, 142 were in the third month and 124 were in the first year after transplantation. Histological signs of toxicity occurred in the third week in 33 (20.1%) patients, with persistence after CI dose reduction in the third month in 27 (19.0%) and in the first year in 23 (18.5%) patients. Of the toxic changes, 52% were clinically silent. At the end of the one-year follow-up, both subclinical and clinically manifest toxicity resulted in a similar progression of chronic changes quantified by Banff chronicity score and they significantly differed from the control group (P < 0.05). Subclinical toxicity affects a significant percentage of grafts; it occurs independently of dosage, blood level and type of applied CI. It is associated with the progression of chronic changes as early as in the first year after transplantation and represents an independent risk factor for chronic allograft damage.

        "Abstract":"The shortage of organs suitable for transplantation has caused a constant evolution of donor acceptance criteria, making an implantation biopsy a valuable tool to predict kidney allograft survival. Preimplantation vascular changes may be divided into sclerosis or intimal fibrous thickening or arteriolar hyalinization. Increasing evidence has indicated their impact on graft function. The aim of this study was to evaluate the significance of preimplantation arteriolar hyalinization for the stability of kidney allograft function. Among a prospective cohort study of 53 kidney recipients (implantation: 2006-2007) who showed serum creatinine values between 1 and 2 mg\/dL at 3 months after engraftment, the mean observation time was 24 +\/- 8.7 months. At the end of the observation, kidney function as defined by the estimated glomerular filtration rate by the Cockcroft-Gault formula (eGFR C-G) was significantly diminished in individuals with preimplantation evidences of arteriolar hyalinization (mean values: 51.2 +\/- 14.8 and 62.0 +\/- 16.7, respectively; P < .03) or serum creatinine concentrations (1.76 +\/- 0.36 vs 1.51 +\/- 0.48 mg\/dL; P < .09). The negative influence of arteriolar hyalinosis on allograft function was time-dependent; an early satisfactory filtration rate did not preclude progressive kidney dysfunction.",

        "Abstract":"PURPOSE: The aim of the study was to analyze the occurrence of primary and secondary glomerulopathies as well as tubulointerstitial nephropathies over time and to assess potential changes in the disease spectrum.\nPATIENTS AND METHODS: The authors retrospectively analyzed all kidney biopsies performed in their institution between 1983 and 2006 as well as the clinical data at the time of biopsy.\nRESULTS: Between January 1983 and December 2006, 359 native kidney biopsies with sufficient material for histological analysis were performed (218 men, 141 women; mean age 51.8 years). A mean of nine glomeruli per biopsy were obtained. Mean serum creatinine at the time of biopsy was 3.3 mg\/dl. The most common indication for biopsy was nephrotic syndrome (31%), followed by renal insufficiency (29%) and proteinuria (14%). Primary glomerulopathies were found in 51%, secondary glomerulopathies in 28%, tubulointerstitial renal diseases in 9%, and vascular renal diseases in 12%. Among the primary glomerulopathies, IgA nephropathy was the most common diagnosis (26%), followed by mesangioproliferative glomerulonephritis (17%), membranous glomerulonephritis (16%), minimal change disease (14%), focal segmental glomerulosclerosis (FSGS; 13%), rapidly progressive glomerulonephritis (RPGN; 8%), and membranoproliferative glomerulonephritis (7%). Among the secondary glomerulopathies, the heterogeneous group of autoimmune diseases (26%) and diabetic nephropathy (25%) dominated. Comparing the period from 1983 to 1994 with 1995 to 2006, a decrease in primary FSGS from 16% to 9% as well as in RPGN from 14% to 1% was noticed, while among the secondary forms, autoimmune diseases with renal involvement increased from 14% to 31%.\nCONCLUSION: In the own patient population changes in the spectrum of primary and secondary glomerulopathies can be observed over time. Thereby, the distribution pattern of the various glomerulonephritides largely corresponds to the distribution described for other West European countries. An increase in the incidence of primary FSGS, as observed in non-European countries, could not be demonstrated.",

Therapy for NSF is challenging, with few options other than preventing exposure to gadolinium and improving renal function through transplant. However, in some cases neither of these options is tenable. We report the successful use of UV-A1 phototherapy in 4 patients with NSF.\nOBSERVATIONS: Four patients with NSF were treated with UV-A1 phototherapy at a tertiary medical center from 2005 through 2007. To our knowledge, it is unique to this series that all patients were receiving hemodialysis before, during, and after therapy with UV-A1. All experienced improvement in the degree of induration, and 2 experienced improvement in mobility of the hands and legs. Total treatments ranged from 22 treatments (with a cumulative dose of 1855 J\/cm(2)) to 50 treatments (total UV-A1 exposure, 3850 J\/cm(2)). No adverse events were observed.\nCONCLUSIONS: Although no patient had complete resolution of indurated plaques, the improvement was substantial. For 2 patients, it resulted in a resumption of hand and leg mobility. As a result, UV-A1 therapy may represent a treatment for NSF when kidney transplantation is not an option or is delayed. Limitations of this study include the lack of a controlled trial, lack of quantification of gadolinium levels within tissue, and the lack of a defined grading scale for NSF severity.",

Renal biopsy was performed when a renal disease other than diabetic nephropathy was suspected because of the presence of haematuria, nephrotic syndrome, non-nephrotic proteinuria < 3 gms\/day in the absence of retinopathy, rapidly progressive glomerulonephritis and renal insufficiency of unknown origin. On the basis of light microscopy and immunofluorescence, three groups of patients were defined. Group I was characterized by diabetic glomerulosclerosis (DGS) only, group II by the prevalence of vascular changes, while group III had sub-groups IIIa (DGS co-existing with nondiabetic renal diseases) and IIIb (non-diabetic renal diseases without DGS).\nRESULTS: Among the 73 patients studied, 20 (27.3%) had diabetic glomerulosclerosis alone (group I), 17 (23.3%) showed occurrence of vascular changes (group II), and 36 (49.3%) had non-diabetic renal diseases (group III). Mean serum creatinine level was significantly greater in group II than in group I and III (p < 0.001). Amount of proteinuria and the presence of haematuria did not show a statistically significant difference in groups I, II and III. The systolic and diastolic blood pressure was higher in groups II as compared to group I and III (p < 0.001). The percentage of sclerotic glomeruli, tubular injury and interstitial inflammation in group II were significantly greater than group I and III (p < 0.001).\nCONCLUSION: Type-II diabetic patients undergoing renal biopsy for impaired renal functions constituted a heterogeneous group of renal damage.

        "Abstract":"Impressive accomplishments have been made in Indian nephrology during the last 5 decades. The first renal biopsy performed in 1956 ushered in a new era of modern nephrology practice in India and led to the recognition of nephrology as a distinct specialty. The first hemodialysis facility was established in 1961; presently, there are 950 nephrologists, 850 hospitals equipped with dialysis facilities, and 170 institutions recognized for kidney transplantation, with approximately 3,500 transplantations performed every year. The majority of dialysis units are small minimal-care facilities with fewer than 5 dialysis stations, and more than 85% are in the private sector. Government hospitals provide free treatment to poor patients with chronic kidney disease; however, inadequate funding and lack of health insurance schemes pose serious hurdles in providing renal replacement therapy. In contrast, private\/corporate hospitals located in big cities have large units with state-of-the-art dialysis and transplantation facilities, similar to advanced centers of the world, but are accessible to only upper-income groups. Of the estimated 175,000 new patients who develop end-stage renal disease annually, less than 10% are able to gain access to renal replacement therapy. Research in the field of renal diseases has evolved slowly and is focused primarily on tropical conditions. The availability of structured nephrology training programs coupled with excellent diagnostic and therapeutic facilities in some academic institutions and tertiary-care private\/corporate hospitals have diminished the need for foreign travel by students, patients, and consultants to a considerable extent. The expansion of therapeutic facilities in India is hampered by only economic constraints, not lack of expertise.",

        "Abstract":"Hepatitis C virus (HCV) infection is the most important liver disease (LD) after renal transplantation. Liver biopsy is the gold standard for the diagnosis and follow-up of LD. The aim of this retrospective study was to evaluate the correlation between values of Fibroscan (EchoSens, Paris, France), a new noninvasive method to assess liver fibrosis, liver biopsy, and clinical data among HCV-positive renal transplant patients. Twenty-four HCV\/RNA-positive patients with a previous liver biopsy were selected to undergo Fibroscan (transient elastography) and a clinical evaluation of liver function. Fibroscan values were expressed in kilopascals (kPa). As 2 patients were eliminated due to obesity or ascites, we analyzed 22 patients. Thirteen patients (59%) with fibrosis F0-F1 (METAVIR score) by biopsy and normal liver function showed a mean Fibroscan score of 5.2 kPa (range, 2.3-6.8 kPa). Three patients (13.6%) exhibited F2 by biopsy and normal liver function with a mean Fibroscan score of 8.2 kPa (range, 7.3-8.9 kPa). Three patients (13.6%) with F3 by biopsy and abnormal liver function showed a high mean Fibroscan score of 10.9 kPa (range, 10.5-11.6 kPa). The last 3 patients (13.6%) with F4 (cirrhosis) by biopsy and abnormal clinical data showed the highest mean Fibroscan value of 14.2 kPa (range, 8.9-18 kPa). In conclusion, among renal transplant patients with HCV the values of Fibroscan seem to correlate with the degree of fibrosis by biopsy and with clinical liver function. Therefore, Fibroscan may be useful to follow patients with LD. However, these results should be analyzed with caution due to the small number of cases and retrospective nature of the study.",

Each histological lesion was evaluated by multivariate survival analysis as predictive factor for renal insufficiency in patients with lupus nephritis, and independent predictors were graded to develop the prognostic score based on the regression coefficient. A receiver operating-characteristic curve based on the prognostic score was plotted to determine the most appropriate cutoff point.\nRESULTS: In class IV, the IV-G group tended to exhibit a worse renal outcome compared with the IV-S group, but the difference was not significant (log-rank test, p = 0.4330). Independent histological predictors of poor renal outcome were extracapillary proliferation, glomerular sclerosis, and fibrous crescents analyzed by Cox proportional hazards model, while predictors of favorable renal outcome were hyaline thrombi and fibrous adhesions. By the prognostic score, renal outcome was significantly worse in the group with the higher score (> or = 0.25) than in the group with the lower score (< 0.25) in class IV patients (log-rank test, p < 0.001).\nCONCLUSION: These results demonstrate the advantage of our prognostic score compared to subclasses in predicting the renal outcome of class IV patients [University Hospital Medical Information Network (UMIN) clinical trials registry, number UMIN 000001943].",

        "Abstract":"INTRODUCTION: When a patient who had renal replacement therapy becomes older, an elder donor candidate may be considered as a potential donor for living-related transplantation. Elder donor candidate might have pre-existing disease including mild renal dysfunction, such as proteinuria. Marginally appropriate donors might be considered for renal graft because of the shortage of donors. A successful outcome after kidney transplantation from a living-related donor diagnosed as membranous nephropathy is reported.\nCASE REPORT: A 38-yr-old male had been on continuous ambulatory peritoneal dialysis (CAPD) since the age of 37. His 63-yr-old father had mild proteinuria, and had been diagnosed with membranous nephropathy by needle biopsy at the age of 60. However, renal function of the father was found to be stable for three yr in a preoperative examination for donor; the father had normal renal function except for mild proteinuria. After adequate informed consent, we transplanted a kidney from the father, diagnosed with membranous nephropathy, to his son with a cyclosporine A-based immunosuppression regimen. In both the recipient and the donor, postoperative course was stable without complication such as rejection or infection. At 57 months after transplantation, the serum creatine level was 1.7 mg\/dL in the recipient and 1.2 mg\/dL in the donor. At 39 months after transplantation, allograft needle biopsy showed mild spike formation with partial thickening of the glomerular basement membrane (GBM). Decreases in electron-dense deposits and electron-lucent washout lesions with thickening of the GBM were observed using electron microscopy. This was diagnosed as Stage IV membranous nephropathy, showing clearance of the immune complexes and histological repair of the GBM.\nCONCLUSION: Donation of the kidney did not affect the residual renal function of the father with membranous nephropathy. Pre-existing membranous nephropathy itself might show remission after transplantation in the recipient. However, long-term careful observation for both the donor and recipient is required.",

        "Abstract":"A 59-yr-old Japanese woman with chronic renal failure caused by IgA nephropathy and antineutrophil cytoplasmic antibody (ANCA)-related glomerulonephritis underwent kidney transplantation from a living unrelated spousal donor. The blood type was compatible, while the human leukocyte antigen (HLA) typing showed a 5\/6 locus mismatch. She had become pregnant twice by her donor and had never received blood transfusions. Complement-dependent cytotoxicity cross-match, flow cytometry cross-match (FCXM), and flow panel reactive antibody (PRA) were negative. She initially underwent one week of immunosuppression with mycophenolate mofetil (MMF) and double filtration plasmapheresis (DFPP) immediately before transplantation to reduce the risk of antibody-mediated rejection. Induction therapy consisted of MMF, tacrolimus (TAC), methylprednisolone (MP), and basiliximab. The allograft function was excellent immediately after the operation. However, the urine output and platelet count declined rapidly on post-operative day (POD) 3, while the serum creatinine (sCr) and lactate dehydrogenase levels rose gradually. Subsequently, we could not detect the diastolic arterial flow on Doppler sonography. We diagnosed accelerated acute rejection and treated her with plasma exchange (PEX), intravenous MP pulse therapy, and rituximab. The first episode biopsy on POD 7 revealed acute vascular rejection and acute antibody-mediated rejection (Banff score AMR II). Her urinary excretion increased beginning on POD 13, while the sCr level decreased gradually and reached 0.9 mg\/dL on POD 22. In our retrospective analysis, the LAB screen detected donor-specific antibody (DSA). This case suggested that, for successful kidney transplantation in highly sensitized recipients, such as husband-to-wife spousal kidney transplantation with a history of pregnancy, we should keep the risk of AMR in mind, even if the sensitive antibody detection tests are negative.",

        "Abstract":"Interstitial fibrosis and tubular atrophy (IF\/TA) in kidney allografts are induced by multiple factors, and although much effort has been devoted on the classification of IF\/TA, clarification of the causes of non-specific IF\/TA is equally important for appropriate therapy. Tamm-Horsfall protein (THP) in renal tissue can be a useful marker for the histological expression of urine backflow and suspected vesicoureteral reflux (VUR). Here, we examined the presence of VUR in pediatric recipients with interstitial THP deposits in kidney allografts to clarify the cause of non-specific IF\/TA. Ten pediatric patients showing interstitial THP deposits with non-specific IF\/TA were enrolled and voiding cystourethrography was performed. Major histological findings of these patients were interstitial mononuclear cell infiltration and fibrosis associated with interstitial THP deposits. The semiquantitative grading scores of IF\/TA were as follows: (i) mild IF\/TA (n = 3); (ii) moderate IF\/TA (n = 3); and (iii) severe IF\/TA (n = 4). In the severe grade, diffuse interstitial mononuclear cell infiltrates were prominent with the appearance of thyroidization classically observed in chronic pyelonephritis. Eight of ten patients (80%) had VUR into the graft. Although symptomatic pyelonephritis was not observed in any of the patients, asymptomatic bacteriuria was detected in 40.0% of the patients. There was no significant correlation between VUR grade and IF\/TA histological score. The patients without VUR also showed mild or severe IF\/TA. Therefore, VUR and urinary flow stasis accompanied by asymptomatic urinary tract infection appear to be the causes of interstitial mononuclear cell infiltration and fibrosis associated with interstitial THP deposits in kidney allografts.",

A noninvasive test that sensitively detects these injuries would benefit the patients.\nMETHODS: Urine samples were collected from healthy controls and kidney transplant recipients. Urine samples were screened first with an antibody array consisting of 120 chemokines and cytokines and then with a multiplex beads assay. Representative parameters, including macrophage inflammatory protein-1Delta, osteoprotegerin, monokine induced by interferon-gamma (IFN), and IFN-gamma-induced protein of 10 kDa, were simultaneously determined by a quadruplex assay in urine samples from 84 patients with renal allograft injury, 29 patients with stable graft function, and 19 healthy individuals.\nRESULTS: Twenty-three cytokines\/chemokines were found to be elevated in urine samples of patients with acute rejection by the antibody array. The second round of screening confirmed that 11 of the 23 parameters were elevated in the patients but not in the healthy controls. Induced protein of 10 kDa and monokine induced by IFN-gamma were significantly elevated in urine samples of patients with acute renal injury, and macrophage inflammatory protein-1Delta and osteoprotegerin were significantly elevated in patients with both acute and chronic renal injuries. The combination of the four parameters had a high positive detection rate (97.6%) for renal transplant injury and could differentiate between acute and chronic injury.\nCONCLUSION: These results might indicate that the present multiplex assay provides a basis to establish a noninvasive method for the diagnosis and monitoring of renal transplant injury.",

Results were compared with a control group of 264 patients aged 60 to 61 who were biopsied over the same period.\nRESULTS: The indications for biopsy were acute kidney injury (AKI) in 46.4%, chronic-progressive kidney injury in 23.8%, nephrotic syndrome (NS) in 13.2%, NS with AKI in 9.4%, and isolated proteinuria in 5.5%. Pauci-immune GN was the most frequent diagnosis (19%), followed by focal segmental glomerulosclerosis secondary to hypertension (7.6%), hypertensive nephrosclerosis (7.1%), IgA nephropathy (7.1%) and membranous nephropathy (7.1%). Comparison with the control group showed pauci-immune GN to be more frequent (P < 0.001) and diabetic glomerulosclerosis (P < 0.001) and membranous nephropathy (P < 0.05) less frequent in the very elderly. Diagnostic information had the potential to modify treatment in 67% of biopsies from the very elderly, particularly in those with AKI or NS.\nCONCLUSIONS: Renal biopsy in very elderly patients is a valuable diagnostic tool that should be offered in clinical settings with maximal potential benefit.

The data included blood pressure, glomerular filtration rate (GFR), serum albumin, and the level of proteinuria. The mean level of serum creatinine was significantly higher in the biopsies' findings of synechiae (adhesions) in the Bowman's capsule, interstitial fibrosis, and global scars (P< 0.05), and mean level of GFR was significantly lower with the presence of interstitial fibrosis (P< 0.05). Furthermore, there was a positive correlation between the level of serum creatinine and global sclerosis (r= 2.21, P= 0.04), and a negative correlation between the level of GFR and global sclerosis(r= 2.01, P= 0.02).

The endpoints included radiologically verified systemic and local recurrence, cancer-specific mortality, overall mortality, and chronic kidney disease as determined from the calculated glomerular filtration rate and Kidney Foundation Dialysis Outcomes Quality Initiative diagnostic criteria.\nRESULTS: The LRN group had larger tumors (5.3 vs 4.9 cm; P = .03), more T3a tumors (33% vs 9%; P = .006), and more clear cell pathologic features (85% vs 66%; P = .03). No surgical margins in either group were positive. The median follow-up was 57 months (range 27-79) for the LRN group and 44 months (range 27-85) for the LPN group (P = .1). The overall mortality (11% vs 11%), cancer-specific mortality (3% vs 3%), and recurrence (3% vs 6%) rates (P = .4) were equivalent.

The aim of this study was to assess the effect of peritoneal sclerosis on outcomes following laparotomy for peritoneal dialysis peritonitis.\nMETHODS: A series of 63 consecutive patients underwent laparotomy for peritoneal dialysis peritonitis. Patients were divided into two groups, those with and those without simple peritoneal sclerosis identified at laparotomy. Medical, anaesthetic, and surgical notes were used for data collection. Patients with known encapsulating peritoneal sclerosis were excluded from the study.\nRESULTS: Patients with simple peritoneal sclerosis had a statistically significant longer duration of peritoneal dialysis. They also had a significantly higher risk of major complications postoperatively and a greater relative risk for mortality.\nCONCLUSIONS: There is an increased prevalence of simple peritoneal sclerosis with long-term peritoneal dialysis. Patients with simple peritoneal sclerosis have higher incidence of postlaparotomy complications. Patients on long-term peritoneal dialysis should be treated aggressively for peritoneal dialysis peritonitis to reduce complication\/mortality rates. Evidence of simple peritoneal sclerosis at laparotomy should preclude further peritoneal dialysis.",

As endoscopic ultrasound-guided fine needle aspiration biopsy (EUS-FNAB) becomes a preferred and popular procedure, it is imperative for cytopathologists recognize this rare lesion and avoid the diagnostic pitfall.\nCASE: A 48-year-old man presented with a 3-cm mass on the lesser curvature of the stomach with regional lymphoadenopathy. EUS-FNAB revealed abundant tenacious, viscous, mucinous material with scattered histiocytes and gastric and esophageal mucosal cells. A mucinous neoplasm was suspected, and partial sleeve gastrectomy was subsequently performed for removal of the gastric mass. The histopathologic finding was characteristic of gastric duplication cyst.\nCONCLUSION: The cytologic features of FDCs may closely resemble those of mucinous neoplasms, especially with clinically elevated carcinogenic embryonic antigen and CA19-9. The abundant mutinous material with scattered mucophages can create a diagnostic challenge and pitfall. Clinical information with endoscopic findings and knowledge of FDC are important for appropriate diagnosis of mucinous lesions.",

        "Abstract":"Renal biopsy plays a central role in the investigational approach of the nephrologist. The technique has significantly improved over the past two decades as a result of the introduction of ultrasonography and automated-gun biopsy devices. Percutaneous renal biopsy has become a relatively safe procedure with life-threatening complications occurring in less than 0.1% of biopsies in recent reports. However, percutaneous kidney biopsy is not without risk. Overt complications occurring in up to 13% of the cases, and 6 to 7% of complications were considered major, needing for an intervention such as transfusion of blood product or invasive procedure (radiographic or surgical). Major complications were apparent in more than 90% of patients by 24 hours. In situations in which the potential benefit of obtaining renal histology outweighs the risks of the procedure, transjugular kidney biopsy or surgical biopsy offers an attractive alternative. At present, we have no definite predictive indicators of postbiopsy bleeding complication, with the exception of age, gender, advanced renal insufficiency and the baseline partial thromboplastin time. Bleeding time is not significantly predictive and has been reported to have substantial limitations as a screening test. The use of the PFA-100 may replace the bleeding time and is now considered as a more valuable screening test for prebiopsy identification and management of patients with impaired haemostasis. Four groups of patients benefit from the findings of renal biopsy: those with a nephrotic syndrome, those with a renal disease in a context of systemic disorder, those with acute renal failure and those with a renal transplant. Some patients with non-nephrotic proteinuria, hematuria and chronic renal failure may also benefit from the procedure.",

Morphologically, it exhibits atypical megakaryocytes, granulocytic precursors, and erythroid precursors set in a background of dense collagen sclerosis. Sclerosing extramedullary hematopoietic tumor may be easily mistaken for other neoplasms, such as sarcoma, carcinoma, or Hodgkin lymphoma, particularly if pertinent clinical history is not provided. Misdiagnosis may occur because of the difficulty in recognizing the megakaryocytic lineage of the atypical cells and because of the paucity of other hematopoietic elements. We report a case of a 72-year-old man with proteinuria and renal insufficiency who underwent renal biopsy to determine the etiology of the proteinuria. The kidney biopsy demonstrated an unusual tumor in which the initial morphological impression that of sclerosing liposarcoma. However, upon learning of the patient's previous history of chronic idiopathic myelofibrosis and with the aid of immunohistochemistry, the correct diagnosis of sclerosing extramedullary hematopoietic tumor was made. Sclerosing extramedullary hematopoietic tumor should be considered in the differential diagnosis when percutaneous renal biopsy or other intra-abdominal biopsy reveals a sclerotic lesion with interspersed large atypical cells, especially in a patient with a history of chronic myeloproliferative disorder.",

A renal biopsy can be a useful tool but may be complicated in LT recipients. We aimed to determine the clinical scenarios that prompted a decision to perform a renal biopsy in this patient population, to assess histological findings and evaluate patient management and survival and renal outcome.\nMETHODS: Information on clinical variables and renal histology was extracted from single-centre prospectively compiled databases from 1996 onwards.\nRESULTS: Over 2100 adults received an LT in the time period studied, and 54 of these (35 males and 19 females) were referred for renal review. Of these, 43% underwent a renal biopsy. They had a higher creatinine (P = 0.02), a greater deterioration in creatinine over the year prior to review and were more likely to be nephrotic (both P < 0.01).

        "Abstract":"Insulin resistance may favor increased urinary albumin excretion (UAE), leading progressively to chronic kidney disease (CKD). A recent study on non-alcoholic fatty liver disease (NAFLD), a condition of insulin resistance, associated this disease with the incidence of CKD in patients with type 2 diabetes. The aim of our study was to determine whether there is an association between insulin resistance and kidney function, based on estimates of UAE and creatinine clearance in children with biopsy-proven NAFLD. Kidney function was assessed in 80 patients with NAFLD and 59 individuals of normal weight matched for age and sex. Insulin resistance was measured by means of the homeostatic model assessment-insulin resistance (HOMA-IR) and limited to NAFLD patients by using the whole-body insulin sensitivity index. The HOMA-IR was found to differ significantly between the two groups (2.69 +\/- 1.7 vs. 1.05 +\/- 0.45; p = 0.002), while UAE (9.02 +\/- 5.8 vs. 8.0 +\/- 4.3 mg\/24 h; p = 0.9) and creatinine clearance (78 +\/- 24 vs. 80 +\/- 29 mg\/min; p = 0.8) did not. We found a significant but weak inverse correlation between insulin sensitivity and creatinine clearance in NAFLD patients (r (s) = -0.25;p = 0.02). No difference was observed in kidney function between NAFLD children presenting with or without metabolic syndrome, low or normal HDL-cholesterol, and different degrees of histological liver damage (grade of steatosis >or=2, necro-inflammation, and fibrosis). Patients with hypertension had increased levels of UAE (p = 0.04). A longer exposure to insulin resistance may be required to cause the increase in urinary albumin excretion and to enable the detection of the effect of the accelerated atherogenic process most likely occurring in children with fatty liver disease. Longitudinal studies are needed to rule out any causative relationship between insulin resistance and urinary albumin excretion.",

The extent of amyloid tissue deposits in the kidneys and the clinical course of amyloidosis not only depend on the type of basic process but also reflect the time of diagnosis and the ability to affect the underlying disease. We analyzed laboratory and clinical data from patients with bioptically proven renal amyloidosis. Renal amyloidosis was found in 99 patients (4.65%) from an overall number of 2,128 renal biopsies (RB) performed in our department during a period of 11 years (from 1995 to 2006). AA amyloidosis was diagnosed in 46 patients. Nephrotic syndrome was diagnosed in 27 patients (59%) with AA amyloidosis; all these patients had different degrees of proteinuria. Impaired renal function was discovered in 24 patients (52%); in three of these patients (6.5%) we had to start renal replacement therapy. Patients were treated with corticosteroids, disease-modifying antirheumatic drugs (DMARDs), and biological therapy in various regimens. Nine patients (19.5%) died during the one-year follow-up period; complications such as sepsis and cardiac failure were the leading causes of death. Median survival in the AA group was 54 months. Although for approximately half of patients different treatment regimens can lead to a partial remission or disease stabilization, the prognosis of patients with amyloidosis could be regarded as unsatisfactory.",

Indeed, an association between bone resorption, release of such complexes, and arterial calcifications has been reported. We have investigated the synthesis and localization of fetuin-A and MGP in bone of hemodialysis patients and the possible contribution of bone cells in arterial calcifications. Bone biopsies from 11 hemodialysis patients were used for histology, in situ hybridization of fetuin-A and MGP messenger RNA (mRNA), immunohistochemistry of fetuin-A, and total, carboxylated, and non-carboxylated MGP proteins. Patients showed various types of renal osteodystrophy, or normal bone. MGP was synthesized and expressed (total and carboxylated) by osteoblasts, osteocytes, and most osteoclasts, while fetuin-A by osteoblasts and osteocytes. Fetuin-A and carboxylated MGP proteins were positive in the calcified matrix, while total MGP was negative. Osteoid seams were negative to fetuin-A, lightly positive to carboxylated MGP, and occasionally positive to total MGP. Undercarboxylated MGP was mostly undetectable. In adult humans, fetuin-A is produced also by osteoblasts, and not only by hepatocytes, as previously believed. MGP, essentially carboxylated, is synthesized by osteoblasts and most osteoclasts.

        "Abstract":"Renal osteodystrophy (ROD), the abnormal bone histology that occurs in the context of kidney disease, is a disease spectrum and not a uniform progressive bone disease. It is an important component of the broad disturbances of bone and mineral metabolism associated with chronic kidney disease (CKD). There are multiple pathogenetic factors which contribute to the histological abnormalities seen on bone biopsy. The patients with ROD are rarely symp-tomatic in the early stages of CKD. It is also noteworthy that the clinical manifestations are usually preceded by biochemical changes that are insidious and subtle. This makes it difficult for the clinician to suspect the presence of bone and mineral metabolism abnormalities without direct testing. The serum calcium, phosphorus, and alkaline phosphatase levels are usually normal until late in the course of CKD. The main screening test for abnormal bone and mineral metabolism is the measurement of parathyroid hormone which is also somewhat delayed. The clinical signs and symptoms are also challenging to interpret because of their slow and non-specific nature which may include vague, ill-defined, bone aches and pains, and muscle weakness. The gold standard for diagnosis of ROD is bone biopsy with mineralized bone histology after double tetracycline labeling, iron staining and aluminum staining. The currently used histomorphometric descriptions of bone histology are not well integrated clinically and a new nomenclature that is clinically more relevant and useful has been proposed. Additional studies are required to define the spectrum of ROD in the current therapeutic era, and to find clinically useful non-invasive biomarkers to improve the treatment and monitoring of the abnormal bone in the setting of CKD.",

Appropriate allocation of combined liver and kidney transplants (CLKT) is crucial with the current organ shortage and lack of standard selection criteria.\nMETHODS: We propose a practical workup algorithm for CLKT by using three variables: duration of renal insufficiency and glomerular filtration rate measured by the iodine-125 iothalamate (Glofil) test and renal biopsy findings. The study was divided into two phases. In the first phase, we retrospectively reviewed the clinical and laboratory database of all liver transplant patients (n=196) performed in our institution. In the second phase, we prospectively implemented the algorithm on 20 selected patients with liver failure and renal dysfunction (chronic kidney disease stage 3 and acute kidney injury) worked up for OLT.\nRESULTS: Based on the workup algorithm, we recommended OLT for 12 patients and CLKT for eight patients. We were able to avoid CLKT for six patients without causing adverse renal outcomes among 11 patients transplanted by using this algorithm. The average 12-month renal outcomes of these transplanted patients seem to be favorable with the mean serum creatinine 1.3 mg\/dL in OLT group and 1.1 mg\/dL in CLKT group.\nCONCLUSION: The workup algorithm, which primarily uses duration of renal failure, glofil measurement, and renal biopsy findings, offers a practical approach to this complicated decision-making process regarding appropriate allocation of organs for CLKT.",

This wide variability is mainly dependent on the different definitions of CRF. In the period 1998-2006, the Triveneto Renal Biopsy Registry recorded 816 cases with CRF (defined as serum creatinine persistently > or =1.5 mg\/dL), accounting for a prevalence of 27%. At the time of biopsy, the average age and glomerular filtration rate were 54 years and 41 mL\/min, respectively; 70% of CRF patients are men and the prevalence of CRF increases with age. IgA nephropathy (IgAN) is the main histological form of glomerulonephritis, accounting for 23% of all cases of CRF. However, in subjects older than 65 years, membranous glomerulonephritis (MG) exceeds IgAN, thus becoming the main diagnosis in elderly patients with renal impairment. With a cutoff value for proteinuria of 3 g\/day, the main diagnoses in cases with proteinuria below and above the cutoff are IgAN and MG, respectively. IgAN remains the main histological form of nephropathy throughout all levels of renal failure. These data confirm the findings of the Italian Registry of Renal Biopsies, but correspond only in part with data from other registries. The differences can to a certain extent be explained by the different criteria for the definition of renal impairment, patient selection, and differences in diagnosis among registries.",

The disease state in chronic kidney disease, which includes the histologic features of bone disease, defined as renal osteodystrophy, and the hormonal and biochemical disturbances, have recently been redefined as a disease syndrome and is referred to as \"chronic kidney disease-mineral and bone disorder.\" As chronic kidney disease progresses, specific histologic disturbances in the bone develop, which may or may not be predictable from the biochemical and hormonal changes that are associated with chronic kidney disease. In addition, patients may have had underlying bone disease before developing kidney failure or may have been treated with agents that will alter the classical pathologic findings of the bones in chronic kidney disease and their relation to parathyroid hormone. Thus, in stage 5 chronic kidney disease, bone biopsy with quantitative histomorphometric analysis is considered the gold standard in the diagnosis of renal osteodystrophy. In contrast to stage 5 chronic kidney disease, there are very few data on the histologic changes in bone in earlier stages of chronic kidney disease. There also is no adequate information on the etiopathogenesis of bone disease in stages 3 and 4 chronic kidney disease.

Case 1 was a 48-year-old man with abdominal pain, hemoperitoneum and secondary hyperparathyroidism after receiving CAPD for seven years. An abdominal CT revealed linear peritoneal calcification in the pelvic cavity and liver surface, and his symptoms resolved after switching to hemodialysis. His clinical course and pathological findings were compatible with those in progressive calcifying peritonitis. Case 2 was a 26-year-old man presenting with abdominal pain, vomiting and fullness two years after switching to hemodialysis, because of uncontrolled overhydration following 13 years of CAPD. Plaque-like calcification outlining the small intestine and parietal peritoneum was noted on CT. Case 3 was a 59-year-old man who had abdominal distention, vomiting and diarrhea three months after switching to hemodialysis due to loss of peritoneal function following 10 years of CAPD. CT revealed diffuse sheet-like calcification surrounding the bowel and mesentery, adherent dilated bowel loops and ascites. These CT findings suggested the existence of encapsulating peritoneal sclerosis (EPS) in cases 2 and 3. Findings from our three patients indicate that peritoneal calcification is not always accompanied by EPS; however, monitoring peritoneal calcification and other findings by abdominal CT, even after cessation of CAPD, is crucial to maintain vigilance on whether the subclinical signs, which are temporally diagnosed as progressive calcifying peritonitis, advance to EPS.",

Progressive chronic kidney disease (CKD) is a major cause of morbidity and mortality in males. Although 40% of heterozygous females may develop renal involvement, pathologic data on Fabry nephropathy in heterozygotes are scarce. We reviewed the kidney biopsies of four affected females who had normal to slightly sub-normal renal function, two of them with overt proteinuria. Chronic non-specific degenerative lesions and glycosphingolipid accumulation per cell type were semi-quantitatively assessed by light and electron microscopy. Cellular distribution of glycosphingolipid deposits was best assessed on semithin sections. Podocyte effacement was seen only in proteinuric patients. Combined analysis of our data with those of two earlier series showed that glomerular sclerosis and tubulointerstitial fibrosis are predictors of proteinuria and CKD stage. There was no histopathological evidence supporting a major role of vascular damage in the early pathogenesis of Fabry nephropathy in females.",

        "Abstract":"BACKGROUND: ABO incompatible kidney transplantation using antigen-specific immunoadsorption is increasingly performed but data on outcome, complications and protocol biopsies are still scarce. The present prospective single-centre study was aimed at these issues.\nMETHODS: This was a prospective single-centre cohort study of 10 successive ABO incompatible living donor kidney transplantations at the University Hospital Basel from September 2005 to October 2007. The following parameters were closely monitored during the whole follow-up: graft function, albuminuria, blood group antibody titres, CD19+ cell count, total IgG and IgG subclasses, CMV antigenaemia, decoy cells in the urine, EBV and polyoma BK virus PCR in the blood. Protocol biopsies were performed on Days 0 and 7 after 3, 6, 12 and 18 months.\nRESULTS: Patient and graft survival is 100% after a median follow-up of 489 days (range 183-916 days). Median serum creatinine is 137 micromol\/l (range 70-215 micromol\/l), and median urine albumin-creatinine ratio (UACR) is 3.1 mg\/ mmol (range 0.6-7.8 mg\/mmol) at the time of the last follow-up. All patients had sustained diminished CD19+ cell count and\/or total IgG concentrations. Neither CMV antigenaemia nor EBV replication in the blood was observed. Seven patients had positive polyoma BK virus replication in the blood but none developed polyoma virus-associated nephropathy (PVAN). Protocol biopsies revealed rejection Banff IIa in three patients on Day 7, and in one patient after 3 and 6 months. Banff Ia rejection was found in five patients. All rejection episodes resolved. Mild signs of chronic antibody-mediated rejection were observed in five patients.\nCONCLUSIONS: ABO-incompatible kidney transplantation seems to be successful and safe. Modifications of the current protocol may be possible and may further reduce potential side effects and costs.",

A renal small-vessel vasculopathy, defined as APS nephropathy, has recently been observed in small series of patients with primary APS (PAPS) and systemic lupus erythematosus (SLE)-APS. We examined the renal histologic, clinical, and laboratory characteristics of different groups of patients with APS including catastrophic APS (CAPS).\nMETHODS: Our study included all CAPS (n=6), PAPS (n=8), and SLE-APS (n=23) patients with biopsy-proven renal involvement who were referred to our departments. The kidney biopsy specimens were retrospectively examined by the same renal pathologist. APS nephropathy was diagnosed as previously described. Demographic, clinical, and laboratory data were recorded.\nRESULTS: All patients with CAPS had acute and chronic renal vascular lesions compatible with diagnosis of APS nephropathy. Thrombotic microangiopathy (TMA), the acute lesion, was observed in all CAPS patients. Fibrous intimal hyperplasia of interlobular arteries (FIH) and focal cortical atrophy (FCA) were the most common chronic vascular lesions, occurring in 4 of 6 (66.7%) and 3 of 6 (50%) patients with CAPS, respectively. TMA was detected in 3 of 8 (37.5%) patients with PAPS and in 8 of 23 (35%) patients with SLE-APS, while FIH and FCA were found with similar frequencies in all 3 groups. Hypertension, proteinuria, hematuria, and renal insufficiency were the most common renal manifestations of all APS groups.\nCONCLUSION: Acute and chronic APS nephropathy lesions were detected in all 3 APS groups. Acute lesions were more prominent in CAPS, while chronic lesions were found with similar frequencies in all groups. Hypertension, proteinuria, hematuria, and renal insufficiency were the most common renal manifestations of all APS groups.",

Between June 1990 and December 2004, 46 patients were diagnosed to have systemic lupus erythematosus (SLE), and 26 of them (56.5%) were found to have DPLN. Renal manifestations were present in 25 patients, and the majority of them presented with severe renal findings, such as nephrotic syndrome and renal failure. All patients were given a quadruple therapy protocol including 6-12 monthly courses of methyl prednisolone pulse therapy combined with oral prednisolone, oral cyclophosphamide, azathioprine, and dipyridamole. Nineteen of these patients were regularly followed up with a mean follow-up period of 5.9 years. Complete remission was achieved in 15 of 19 patients, and chronic renal failure developed in four patients. Renal survival rate was calculated to be 78.9% at the end of 5, 10, and 14 years. Although nephrotic range proteinuria, hypoalbuminemia, renal failure, and activity index above 12\/24 at presentation seemed to be associated with poor prognosis, no significant difference could be found. Hypertension and chronicity index greater than 6\/12 were found to be bad prognostic predictors. We concluded that satisfactory results were achieved with our quadruple therapy protocol; thus, more aggressive and expensive therapies can be avoided and preserved for more serious and persistent diseases.",

Reports of spontaneous keloids are rare in the literature, and given his history of renal failure, we have considered a connection with nephrogenic systemic fibrosis (NSF). With no history of prior keloid formation, the patient developed a large number of lesions with a wide distribution, which then subsequently healed without keloid formation. Additionally, the lesions stained positive for CD68 and factor XIIIa, both of which are correlated with the lesions of NSF. However, the patient did not present with the classic clinical presentation of NSF, had no history of exposure to gadolinium, and staining for CD34 was negative. In conclusion, NSF is a relatively new disease, the details of which have yet to be clearly established. This case may represent a variant of NSF.",

        "Abstract":"PURPOSE: Male infertility is a serious problem in patients on hemodialysis. Our understanding is that end stage renal disease or hemodialysis causes poor semen quality but the mechanism leading to impaired spermatogenesis is largely unknown.\nMATERIALS AND METHODS: Testicular volume in 120 patients on maintenance hemodialysis was compared with that in age matched healthy controls. Volume was correlated with clinical findings. In 10 testicular biopsy specimens from patients on hemodialysis who visited our infertility clinic Western blotting was performed to examine the generation of 4-HNE modified proteins, which are markers of oxidative stress, and the expression of proliferating cell nuclear antigen. Interstitial fibrosis was determined by Masson's trichrome staining.\nRESULTS: Mean bilateral testicular volume in patients on hemodialysis was significantly smaller than that in healthy controls (31.7 vs 36.4 ml, p <0.01) in a hemodialysis duration dependent manner (r = -0.32, p <0.01). The increase in serum ferritin correlated inversely with testicular volume (r = -0.25, p <0.01). The generation of 4-HNE modified proteins was significantly increased 3.1-fold in patients on hemodialysis, following the 60% decreased expression of proliferating cell nuclear antigen. Quantitative analysis of Masson's trichrome staining revealed increased interstitial fibrosis in patients on hemodialysis compared with that in controls (41.5% vs 14.8%, p <0.01). Serum ferritin, proliferating cell nuclear antigen expression and interstitial fibrosis correlated with the generation of 4-HNE modified proteins (p <0.05).\nCONCLUSIONS: Testicular volume, which is a parameter of spermatogenesis, is impaired in patients on hemodialysis and oxidative stress is considered to be involved in the process. Serum ferritin is a useful parameter for predicting oxidative stress in the testis.",

Glomerulonephritis is considered one of the leading causes of end-stage renal disease. The prevalence of different renal lesions were identified by inconsistent studies. The causes of inconsistencies include lack of unified methods in diagnosing and processing renal biopsies by different pathologists, patients selection's bias for renal biopsy, and the variable policies and protocols adopted by different nephrologists. Establishment of renal biopsy registry may help to surmount these differences. In addition, combined data obtained from renal biopsy renal and replacement therapy registries can help study the long-term outcome of patients with renal diseases.",

Our objective is to define renal morphological abnormalities in children and adolescents with Fabry disease and minimal proteinuria.\nSTUDY DESIGN: Case series.\nSETTING & PARTICIPANTS: 9 symptomatic patients (7 males, 2 females; age range, 7 to 18 years); 2 patients had received enzyme replacement therapy for 2 years.\nOUTCOMES & MEASUREMENTS: Renal morphological changes assessed by using light and electron microscopy.\nRESULTS: All patients had acroparesthesia and typical eye changes, 7 showed hypohidrosis, 7 had gastrointestinal problems, and 2 had typical angiokeratomas. Mean albumin-creatinine ratio was 38 mg\/g [corrected] (range, 5.3 to 104.3 mg\/g). [corrected] Measured glomerular filtration rate was normal in all patients. Light microscopy showed changes in glomerular, tubulointerstitial, or vascular compartments alone or in combination in 7 patients. Electron microscopy showed lesions in all patients.\nLIMITATIONS: Small sample size.\nCONCLUSIONS: Glomerular and vascular changes are present before progression to overt proteinuria and decreased glomerular filtration rate. The combination of acroparesthesia and mild albuminuria, glomerular endothelial cell deposits, and arteriopathy may constitute a clinical and morphological combination heralding a potentially progressive renal disease.",

We investigated further the relationship between renal allograft survival and CD20+ lymphocytic infiltrates in renal transplant biopsies from children with graft dysfunction. Fifty consecutive unselected renal transplant biopsies were performed for investigation of acute, chronic or acute on chronic renal allograft dysfunction in 48 children aged 1-17 (median 13.1) years, at 0-155 (median 22) months post-transplantation with median follow up of 24 months post-biopsy. Seventeen (35%) graft losses occurred at 1-163 (median 49) months post-transplantation. There was increased graft loss in those with dense (>300 cells\/hpf) CD20+ lymphocytic infiltrates present on biopsy (p = 0.043). Dense B-cell infiltrates were also associated with increased glucocorticoid requirement in those with acute cellular rejection (p = 0.0015). There were no significant differences in age, sex, HLA-mismatch, type of transplantation, EBV or CMV serology or baseline immunosuppressive regimens between those with or without dense CD20+ infiltrates. Dense CD20+ lymphocytic infiltrates in renal transplant biopsies are associated with adverse clinical outcome, including increased graft loss. This observation raises the possibility of future studies examining the efficacy of B cell depletion therapy in this clinical context.",

Such calcifications in women could pose a problem for interpretation of mammograms, since they are thought to mimic malignant lesions and interfere with differentiation of benign from malignant disease. Investigation of this issue is important to provide high-quality, accurate breast care to women with CKD or ESRD, but little evidence is so far available. In a systematic review of the literature on the types and patterns of breast calcifications, we found only three studies that examined metastatic soft-tissue calcifications of the breast. The studies did, however, confirm that women with CKD or ESRD have a higher frequency of breast calcification than women with normal kidney function. The two older studies reported that these breast calcifications are not associated with malignancy, but the later study reported a raised rate of suspicious breast calcification among women with ESRD receiving hemodialysis, leading to an increased biopsy referral rate. In this Review we discuss the strengths and limitations of the available data and whether mammography is recommended in women with CKD or ESRD.",

This study analyzed the frequency and clinicopathologic correlations of renal native biopsied acute renal failure in Spain during the period 1994 through 2006.\nDESIGN, SETTING, PARTICIPANTS, & MEASUREMENTS: Acute renal failure was defined as a rapid deterioration of glomerular filtration rate, with or without oligoanuria or rapidly progressive renal insufficiency, including acute-on-chronic renal failure. Patients who were younger than 15 yr were considered children, those between 15 and 65 yr adults, and those >65 elderly.\nRESULTS: Between 1994 and 2006, data on 14,190 native renal biopsies were collected from 112 renal units in Spain. Of these, 16.1% (2281 biopsies) were diagnosed with acute renal failure. The prevalence of the main clinical syndromes was different in the three age groups: Biopsy-confirmed acute renal failure in children was 5.7%, in adults was 12.5%, and in elderly increased significantly to 32.9%. The prevalence of biopsy-confirmed acute renal failure according to cause was as follows: Vasculitis, 23.3%; acute tubulointerstitial nephritis, 11.3%; and crescentic glomerulonephritis types 1 and 2, 10.1%. The prevalence of the different causes differed significantly according to age group.\nCONCLUSIONS: The Spanish Registry of Glomerulonephritis provides useful information about renal histopathology in biopsy-confirmed acute renal failure. The prevalence of vasculitis and crescentic glomerulonephritis is high, especially in elderly patients. These data obtained from a national large registry highlight the value of renal biopsy in undetermined acute renal failure.",

        "Abstract":"The purpose of this study was to describe the indications for and technique of transjugular renal biopsy (TJRB) and evaluate the efficacy and complications of this method. We performed a retrospective review of 59 patients who underwent TJRB using the Quick-core needle biopsy system (Cook, Letchworth, UK) over a 4-year period. The indications for obtaining renal biopsy included acute renal failure, chronic renal failure, nephrotic syndrome, and proteinuria with or without other associated disease. Indications for the transjugular approach included coagulopathy, biopsy of a solitary kidney or essentially single functioning kidney, simultaneous renal and hepatic biopsy, morbid obesity, and failed percutaneous biopsy. All but four cases were performed via the right internal jugular vein. The right, left, or both renal veins were cannulated in 41, 14, and 4 cases, respectively. Combined liver and renal biopsies were obtained in seven cases. Diagnostic biopsy specimens were obtained in 56 of 59 patients (95%). The number and size of tissue cores ranged from 1 to 9 mm and from 1 to 20 mm, respectively. The mean numbers of glomeruli per procedure on light microscopy and electron microscopy were 10.3 and 2.6, respectively. Specimens for immunohistology were acquired in 49 cases, of which 40 were adequate. Of the 56 successful TJRB procedures, 34 (61%) were associated with isolated capsular perforation (19), contained subcapsular leak (10), isolated collecting system puncture (1), and concurrent collecting system and capsular perforation (4). There was a significant increase in capsular perforation with six or more needle passes, although no significant correlation was seen between number of needle passes and complication. Six patients had minor complications defined as hematuria or loin pain. Seven patients developed major complications, of whom five received blood transfusion alone. Two required intervention: in one an arteriocalyceal fistula was embolized and the patient was temporarily dialyzed; the remaining patient required ureteric stenting. In conclusion, TJRB provides an adequate yield for diagnosis. Complication rates are relatively high, but patients are also at high risk from the conventional percutaneous approach. Patient selection and optimization are critical to avoid major complications.",

The aim of the present study was to determine the relation of VEGF expression and cortical vascularity with renal pathological changes and clinical parameters in allograft biopsies.\nMATERIALS AND METHODS: Sections from 50 renal allograft biopsies were evaluated by streptavidine-biotin immunohistochemistry by primary antibodies against VEGF and CD34. Cortical tubulointersititial (TI) VEGF expression was scored by light microscopic examination considering intensity and density. Glomerular expression was scored as 0: no staining; 1: faint staining in less than 50% of glomeruli; 2: moderate to strong staining in more than 50% of glomeruli. We determined the number of vessels per cortical high power field (Nves) highlighted by CD34 staining. The clinical and pathological features were retrieved from patient files.\nRESULTS: Nves was decreased with interstitial fibrosis (IF): 56.3 +\/- 3.7; 53.3 +\/- 9.8, 46.6 +\/- 10.5, 36.75 +\/- 1.89 for cases with no IF to mild, moderate, and severe forms, respectively (P << .000). There was increased TI VEGF expression: 1.86 +\/- 2.12, 5.8 +\/- 3.1, 5.85 +\/- 4.4, 10.25 +\/- 2.06, respectively (P = .004). The NVes values were not different for cases with high and low to negative VEGF expression scores. There was a negative correlation between Nves values and creatinine at the time of biopsy and time from transplantation to biopsy (r = -.325, P = .024 and r = -.294, P = .038, respectively). Nves and VEGF scores were not different when acute rejection scores or cyclosporine toxicity were considered (P > .05), while Nves were significantly different for chronic allograft nephropathy scores (P = .05).\nCONCLUSIONS: Chronic renal changes seemed to be associated with decreased cortical vascularity in renal allografts, while the TI VEGF expression was increased. In contrast Nves was not increased with VEGF expression in this series. It seems that along with VEGF, other factors are required for protection against vascular reduction. The aging of the allograft is also a negative influence on cortical vascularity.",

We aimed to study the clinicopathologic features of renal biopsies after HSCT by reviewing 13 percutaneous renal biopsies in our institute (Queen Mary Hospital).\nMETHODS: A retrospective clinicopathologic study of all renal biopsies archived to the Department of Pathology, Queen Mary Hospital during the period January 1999 to December 2006 was performed. Biopsies from patients with HSCT were selected. Clinical data on presentation and follow up were retrieved from hospital records and physicians.\nRESULTS: In the 8-year period, a total of 2233 native renal biopsies were archived. Thirteen renal biopsies were selected from 12 patients with HSCT (11 allogeneic, one autologous). All but one patient were male. The age at renal biopsy ranged from 7 to 63 years (median: 32 years). The median interval of renal biopsy after HSCT was 24 months (range 1-134 months). Evidence of graft-versus-host disease was found in nine patients. The most common presentation was significant proteinuria (10 cases) and renal impairment (eight cases). The predominant histological changes were membranous glomerulonephritis (n = 4) and thrombotic microangiopathy (n = 4). One case of focal segmental glomerulosclerosis, IgA nephropathy, minimal change disease, acute tubular necrosis and hypertensive nephrosclerosis were also recorded. Four of our patients died at 0-11 months after renal biopsy. Of the remaining eight patients with a mean follow up of 43.6 months (range, 10-98 months), chronic renal impairment were found in three (37.5%) patients and significant proteinuria also persisted in three. One patient had cytogenetic evidence of relapse of underlying haematological malignancy after HSCT.\nCONCLUSION: Among the various renal lesions after HSCT, membranous glomerulonephritis and thrombotic microangiopathy were the most common. Mechanisms of renal injury varied from graft-versus-host disease-associated immune complex deposition to non-immune complex injury on endothelial cells, glomerular epithelial cells and tubular epithelium. Pathologists and clinicians should attend to the histological and temporal heterogeneity of renal injury when managing patients after HSCT.",

        "Abstract":"CONTEXT: Although risks associated with live kidney donation are low, there are few pathologic studies of kidneys from live donors, and possible risk factors for development of hypertension or renal insufficiency remain unknown. There are many studies of histopathologic changes in deceased donor kidneys and how these changes affect subsequent graft function; most are based on wedge rather than needle core biopsies.\nOBJECTIVE: To examine the frequency and severity of arterial fibrointimal thickening and other pathologic lesions in kidneys from healthy live donors and compare wedge and needle core biopsies as methods for evaluating these changes.\nDESIGN: For 36 of 332 live donor renal transplantations performed from January 2004 through November 2006, a wedge biopsy of the transplanted kidney was done prior to and\/or after implantation, and a needle core biopsy was done postimplantation or during the ensuing 7 days. For these 36 allografts, we compared pathologic features of the wedge and core perioperative biopsies.\nRESULTS: Findings on core and wedge biopsies were similar, except for arterial fibrointimal thickening. Moderate thickening (Banff cv2) was present on 13 core biopsies, and mild thickening (cv1) was present on another 10; by contrast, no wedge biopsies showed cv2 lesions, and only 8 showed cv1. Arterial thickening on core but not wedge biopsies correlated significantly with increasing patient age.\nCONCLUSIONS: The findings indicate that needle core biopsies are superior to wedge biopsies for evaluating vascular changes in donor kidneys, and they suggest a need for studies correlating such changes with long-term outcomes of live donors, particularly older donors.",

        "Abstract":"CONTEXT: African Americans have a 4-fold greater risk than whites for developing end-stage renal disease. Glomerulomegaly, possibly related to obesity, has been identified in high-risk populations and is suggested to be a marker for end-stage renal disease risk.\nOBJECTIVE: To investigate differences in glomerular size and patient clinical characteristics at the time of renal biopsy for the major diseases contributing to end-stage renal disease.\nDESIGN: Mean glomerular tuft volumes were estimated by the Weibel-Gomez method (1964) in native renal biopsies of 203 African American and 100 white patients 18 years of age and older by point counting on a stereologic grid. Glomerulosclerosis was graded on individual glomeruli from 0 to 4, and a glomerular sclerosis index was calculated for each biopsy. Relationships between the mean volume of nonsclerotic glomeruli, age, sex, race, sclerosis index, cortical fibrosis, estimated glomerular filtration rate, body mass index, and disease diagnosis were analyzed.\nRESULTS: Racial differences in mean volume of nonsclerotic glomeruli and body mass index were not significant in any disease category, and African Americans had more severe disease as determined by sclerosis index, cortical fibrosis, and estimated glomerular filtration rate only in focal segmental glomerulosclerosis. For all patients, increased sclerosis index and cortical fibrosis and lower estimated glomerular filtration rate were best predicted by increased age (P < .001).\nCONCLUSIONS: For approximately the same severity of disease, African Americans were 10 years or more younger than whites with the difference being seen in all disease categories except membranous glomerulonephritis and diabetes. Glomerulomegaly relative to whites was not a distinguishing feature of African American renal biopsies.",

        "Abstract":"PURPOSE: The purpose of this study was to determine the extent to which the use of nonsterile gel, prior to antiseptic procedures in ultrasonography (US)-guided percutaneous biopsies, results in contamination of the biopsy site.\nMATERIALS AND METHODS: Patients referred for US-guided percutaneous biopsies were included in this study. Transmission material used for US evaluation before biopsy-site antiseptic procedures were performed was either nonsterile gel or sterile saline. Patients were randomly assigned to two groups: nonsterile gel (n = 30) and sterile saline (n = 30). Before the transmission material was used and after antiseptic procedures were performed, microbial swabs of a 10-cm(2)-diameter area were obtained at the biopsy site. Swabs were also obtained from the gel, saline, and povidine-iodine. Inoculated specimen plates were incubated at 37 degrees C under aerobic conditions, and the numbers of colony-forming units recorded. Nominal logistic regression analysis was used to calculate the odds of postantisepsis bacterial growth (after antiseptic procedures were performed) based on group, gender, coincidental disease (diabetes, chronic renal failure, and malignancy), biopsy-site location (head and neck or breast and abdomen), and local factors (skin fold, skin tag, and hair).\nRESULTS: The following odds ratios (adjusted for the other variables) and their 95% confidence intervals were calculated: (1) group (2.9 [0.8-11.1]; p = 0.10); (2) gender (1.2 [0.3-5.2]; p = 0.78); (3) coincidental disease (7.6 [0.9-166.7]; p = 0.09); (4) biopsy site location (6.2 [1.4-31.3]; p = 0.02); and (5) local factors (7.0 [1.6-36.0]; p = 0.01). No bacterial growth occurred with swabs obtained from gel, povidine-iodine, or saline.\nCONCLUSION: We conclude that nonsterile gel used prior to percutaneous biopsy does not affect biopsy-site asepsis.",

We combined data on AR with long-term graft function and histopathology to assess whether early treatment of AR is beneficial for long-term graft outcome in small children. Seventy-seven children with a mean age of 4.7 yr were studied. Early AR were diagnosed with FNAB and treated with methylprednisolone already before clinical signs occurred. The children were grouped into three groups (clinical, subclinical, and no AR) and then followed prospectively up to seven yr after TX with measured GFR and core needle biopsies to assess histopathological findings with the CADI score. Early AR, whether clinical or subclinical, did not affect long-term graft survival (80% with AR vs. 83% without AR, at 10 yr). Late AR, more than one yr after TX, had an inferior graft survival 50% vs. 84% (p = 0.02). GFR declined and the CADI scores increased with time, but there were no significant differences between the three groups. Prompt and early treatment of post-operative AR gives favorable long-term graft function compared with children without AR. Late AR is a risk factor for inferior long-term graft function.",

There is concern about an increased risk associated with percutaneous liver biopsy (PCNB) in ESRD patients. We compared the safety of PCNB in CHC patients with and without ESRD.\nMETHODS: We reviewed PCNBs performed between 1996 and 2004 for technique, histology, and complications in 78 ESRD patients with CHC and in 241 control patients with CHC and no renal failure, randomly matched for age, sex, and race. Platelet counts, prothrombin, and partial thromboplastin times, but not bleeding times, were checked before biopsy. Deamino-8-D-arginine vasopressin was not given before the biopsy.\nRESULTS: The mean age of the patients was 50 years; 72% were male, 97% were African American, and 3% were Caucasian. The control group had a significantly higher proportion of patients with advanced fibrosis (P < .04). Only 1 patient with ESRD (1.3%) developed a moderate complication. Five controls (2.1%) developed complications, 3 of which were severe.\nCONCLUSIONS: Severe complications after PCNB are uncommon, and patients with ESRD and CHC are at no increased risk. Testing for bleeding time and the routine use of deamino-8-D-arginine vasopressin are not necessary before PCNB in patients with ESRD.",

The purpose of this retrospective review of 8 cases is to assess the value of different imaging techniques in the evaluation of this pathology. Six males and 2 females, aged 29 to 75 years were included. The right kidney was involved in 5 cases and the left kidney was involved in 3 cases. Involvement was upper polar in 2 cases and lower polar in 6 cases. A kidney stone was present in 3 cases. US showed a heterogeneous hypoechoic lesion in 3 cases, a homogeneous hypoechoic lesion in 3 cases, and isoechoic lesion in 1 case and a cystic lesion in 1 case. CT showed a focal solid lesion with peripheral enhancement in 4 cases and a cystic mass with peripheral enhancement in 3 cases. US features are non-specific. CT shows a non-specific renal mass, the presence of obstruction and demonstrates perirenal involvement. Preoperative MRI, not performed in our patient population, demonstrates specific changes in the perirenal fat that suggests the diagnosis. The diagnosis of pseudotumoral xanthogranulomatous pyelonephritis can be suspected on a constellation of clinical and laboratory findings combined with non-specific features on CT and US and specific MRI features of perirenal fat changes.

This paper uses the biopsychosocial model to identify predictors of employment for 411 individuals transplanted at a single, large Midwestern academic center. Less than 50% of respondents reported part-time or full-time employment post-transplant. Factors found to predict employment were age at the time of transplant, race, sex, and patient perception of physical functioning. Individuals who were younger when transplanted, Caucasian, and males were more likely to be employed full-time following transplantation as were those who perceived themselves to have a higher level of physical functioning. No biological factors, including serum creatinine, mean arterial pressure (MAP), and diabetic status, were significant predictors of employment.

        "Abstract":"OBJECTIVE: The purpose of this study was to evaluate whether islet transplantation may stabilize polyneuropathy in uremic type 1 diabetic patients (end-stage renal disease [ESRD] and type 1 diabetes), who received a successful islet-after-kidney transplantation (KI-s).\nRESEARCH DESIGN AND METHODS: Eighteen KI-s patients underwent electroneurographic tests of sural, peroneal, ulnar, and median nerves: the nerve conduction velocity (NCV) index and amplitudes of both sensory action potentials (SAPs) and compound motor action potentials (CMAPs) were analyzed longitudinally at 2, 4, and 6 years after islet transplantation. Skin content of advanced glycation end products (AGEs) and expression of their specific receptors (RAGE) were also studied at the 4-year follow-up. Nine patients with ESRD and type 1 diabetes who received kidney transplantation alone (KD) served as control subjects.\nRESULTS: The NCV score improved in the KI-s group up to the 4-year time point (P = 0.01 versus baseline) and stabilized 2 years later, whereas the same parameter did not change significantly in the KD group throughout the follow-up period or when a cross-sectional analysis between groups was performed. Either SAP or CMAP amplitudes recovered in the KI-s group, whereas they continued worsening in KD control subjects. AGE and RAGE levels in perineurium and vasa nervorum of skin biopsies were lower in the KI-s than in the KD group (P < 0.01 for RAGE).\nCONCLUSIONS: Islet transplantation seems to prevent long-term worsening of polyneuropathy in patients with ESRD and type 1 diabetes who receive islets after kidney transplantation. No statistical differences between the two groups were evident on cross-sectional analysis. A reduction in AGE\/RAGE expression in the peripheral nervous system was shown in patients receiving islet transplantation.",

        "Abstract":"BACKGROUND: Thin basement membrane nephropathy (TBMN) and IgA glomerulonephritis (IgA gn) are the most common primary glomerular conditions diagnosed on renal biopsy, performed for microscopic haematuria or microscopic haematuria with proteinuria. While up to 50% of patients with IgA gn will develop chronic renal failure, most patients with TBMN enjoy an excellent prognosis. Because TBMN is estimated to occur in up to 1% of the general population, differentiation between the two conditions without resort to renal biopsy is desirable.\nMETHODS: This retrospective analysis of 248 patients diagnosed on renal biopsy as having either TBMN or IgA gn, sought to identify clinical or biochemical factors which would have enabled confident differentiation between the two conditions to be made without resort to renal biopsy.\nRESULTS: No single clinical or pathological variable adequately discriminated between the two conditions. Impaired renal function and heavy proteinuria were highly specific for IgA gn but lacked sensitivity in differentiating from TBMN. Isolated microscopic haematuria (IMH) was a more common finding in patients diagnosed with TBMN but, as a discriminator between TBMN and IgA gn, lacked sufficient specificity. However, if assumptions were made based on the differing incidence of a positive family history between IgA gn and TBMN, then specificity of >99% could be achieved.\nCONCLUSION: TBMN and IgA gn cannot be distinguished on the basis of clinical or pathological variables alone. However, in patients with IMH and a positive family history of either IMH or biopsy-proven TBMN, there is usually no need for renal biopsy.",

The specimens were evaluated for histological features of APSN and other significant clinical parameters. The result of antiphospholipid antibodies, clinical course, and renal function from chart review were analysed.\nRESULTS: The prevalence of APSN in systemic lupus erythematosus patients who underwent renal biopsies was 34% (16% in <15-year-old group, 41.5% in > or =15-year-old group). APSN was associated with more severe hypertension (P = 0.002 for systolic and P = 0.004 for diastolic blood pressure), acute renal failure (P = 0.003), persistent heavy proteinuria (P < 0.001 for 4+ proteinuria), severe lupus nephritis (class III and IV, P = 0.014, high activity and chronicity indices, P < 0.001) and a tendency to progress to end-stage renal disease.\nCONCLUSION: Systemic lupus erythematosus patients who underwent renal biopsies in our institute showed a prevalence of APSN comparable to those in western countries. The presence of APSN was significantly higher in the adult than in the paediatric population. Its association with poor prognostic indicators suggests poor renal outcome.

        "Abstract":"Having worked in nephrology for more than 20 years, and never encountering this condition before, we came across three patients who had been diagnosed with calciphylaxis in the space of 12 months. This condition is also known as calcific uraemic arteriolopathy and is a syndrome of medical calcification of the small arteries, which leads to painful ischaemia of the surrounding subcubitis and skin (1). Prevalence of 1-4% has been estimated in various haemodialysis populations. Also 1% per year in dialysis patients has also been suggested (3). The mortality rate for distal lesions is 23%, whilst the mortality for proximal lesions is 63% (4). The pathogenesis of this condition remains uncertain. However, vascular calcium deposition is thought to be important, and raised serum phosphate levels were associated with a substantially increased risk of calciphylaxis. Although PTH levels were high, plasma PTH was not consistently higher in patients with calciphylaxis than controls (5). The important aspect of the condition for the patients is the sheer pain and distress suffered, as well as the high mortality rate. Therefore, the implications for nurses are early detection, to allow speedy treatment to take place and involvement of the multidisciplinary team to enhance care and provide as much support as possible, thus facilitating optimal outcome and comfort.",

Although, it remains controversial, antiviral treatment seems to be able to improve the outcome of glomerulonephritis.\nAIM: The objectives of the study were to analyze characteristics of this association and to report literature data and newness treatment.\nMETHODS: It's a retrospective study including 11 patients with membranoproliferative glomerulonephritis, hepatitis C virus and mixed cryoglobulinemia. Hepatitis C virus antibodies was identified by ELISA technique. Hepatitis C virus genotype was identified in one patient. Cryoglobulins were isolated from sera of all patients at 37 degrees Celsius.\nRESULTS: Patients were 3 men and 8 women with a mean age of 51.9 +\/- 15.5 years. Between the 11 patients, 7 had hypertension, 9 had nephrotic syndrome and 10 had chronic renal failure. Renal biopsy showed membranoproliferative glomerulonephritis lesions in all cases with fibrinoid thrombi in 8 cases. Six patients had chronic liver disease. Liver biopsy was performed in 4 patients, showing histological feature compatible with chronic active hepatitis in 2 cases. No patient had antiviral therapy. Renal failure was stable in 5 cases and progressed in 6 cases with end stage renal failure in 3 of them. One patient died, 4 months after diagnosis, because of severe pulmonary involvement in cryoglobulinemic vasculitis. In literature, treatment is dominated by antiviral therapy composed first by Interferon Alpha alone. Combination therapy associating Interferon and Ribavirin was recently used in renal involvement; it is clearly more effective than interferon alpha alone.\nCONCLUSION: Hepatitis C virus detection should be performed when membranoproliferative glomerulonephritis is associated with cryoglobulinemia. Antiviral treatment should be more widely used in Tunisia to evaluate his effect on renal involvement",

After penile amputation was performed because of severe pain, the wound became ulcerated, and a rectal ulcer as well as skin ulcers also developed in the bilateral inguinal regions. The penile necrosis, skin ulcers, and rectal ulcer were thought to have been caused by calciphylaxis.

The transplant renal artery was anastomosed to the right internal iliac artery with an end-to-end anastomosis. The patient achieved immediate graft function and the allograft was normally perfused. Seven weeks later, renal allograft function deteriorated with a serum creatinine level increased to 244 micromol\/L. An ultrasound scan revealed adequate perfusion to the kidney and the absence of hydronephrosis. A transplant biopsy revealed Banff IB rejection, which was treated with high-dose prednisolone. Following biopsy, the patient's renal function rapidly deteriorated with a serum creatinine level increased to 627 micromol\/L, requiring hemodialysis. A computed tomography (CT) angiogram demonstrated a 6-cm diameter pseudoaneurysm arising from the internal iliac artery with absence of kidney perfusion. The aneurysm was accessed percutaneously with a 4-F catheter and 1000 U of human thrombin injected, resulting in partial thrombosis of the pseudoaneurysm. A balloon expandable covered metal stent was then placed across the site of the transplant renal artery anastomosis, resulting in successful occlusion of the aneurysm. Intrarenal blood flow was established by dilating 2 intrarenal branches with 3-mm diameter balloons. The serum creatinine level started to decrease within 24 hours of the procedure and renal function improved rapidly to a level achieved immediately after transplantation. Three months later the patient had a well-functioning allograft with a serum creatinine level of 176 micromol\/L, follow-up CT scan demonstrated good perfusion of the transplanted kidney with no further change in the pseudoaneurysm.

We aimed to analyze retrospectively the main histological renal findings, over a 10-year (1995-2004) period, in a large tertiary nephrology referral center in North-Eastern (N-E) Romania, serving a population of 4.7 million inhabitants. Clinical and biological data were also collected and correlated with histological findings. 336 renal biopsies were finally analyzed. The distribution of major clinical syndromes was: nephrotic syndrome (52%), followed by acute renal failure (19%), mild-to-moderate chronic renal failure (17%), nephritic syndrome (8%) and asymptomatic urinary abnormalities. 56.6% and 32.2% were primary and secondary glomerulopathies (GN), respectively, whereas vascular nephropathies and tubulointerstitial nephritis accounted for only 3.6 and 2% of the diagnoses. Overall, membranoproliferative (MPGN) (38%) and mesangioproliferative (MesGN) GN's (19%) were the most common primary glomerulopathies. A progressive significant decrease in the incidence of MPGN and an increase in MesGN over time were seen in our center. Analyzing other Romanian regional data, also a geographical \"shift\" in the prevalence of the most common primitive GN's from Eastern (E) to Western (W) Romania, similar to the N to S gradients across Europe was noted: there is a high prevalence of MPGN in the E, and a high prevalence of MesGN (including IgA nephropathy) in W Romania. These important differences in the prevalence of the most common primary GN's in E Romania may be due to lower income, education, and infrastructure levels. This hypothesis is strengthening by the higher prevalence of post-infectious and, possible, vasculitis-related GN in E Romania.",

        "Abstract":"BACKGROUND: Imatinib is a tyrosine-kinase inhibitor; for which there is limited information regarding its effects on AIDS Kaposi's sarcoma and none in patients with transplant-associated Kaposi's sarcoma. Sirolimus, an immunosuppressive drug used for kidney transplant, exhibits antiangiogenic activity related to impaired production of VEGF (vascular endothelial growth factor), clinical benefit has been reported in Kaposi's sarcoma associated with renal graft.\nCASE PRESENTATION: Here we report a case of an 80 year old male, who developed Kaposi's Sarcoma nine months after receiving a living non-related donor kidney transplant at age 74. Three years after treatment with different chemotherapeutic agents for progressive cutaneous Kaposi's Sarcoma with no visceral involvement, he was prescribed Imatinib (200 mg\/day for two weeks followed by 400 mg\/day) after four weeks of treatment he developed anasarca, further progression of KS and agranulocytosis. Imatinib was discontinued and there was significant clinical recovery. One year later his immunosuppressive therapy was changed to Sirolimus and regression of the Kaposi's sarcoma occurred.\nCONCLUSION: The lack of benefit and severe toxicity associated with the use of Imatinib in this patient should alert clinicians of potentially adverse consequence of its use in patients with transplant associated Kaposi's sarcoma. On the other hand the positive response seen in this patient to Sirolimus even after a long evolution of Kaposi's sarcoma, multiple chemotherapy regimens and extensive cutaneous disease further suggest it therapeutical utility for transplant associated Kaposi's sarcoma.",

        "Abstract":"Among adult patients with isolated microscopic haematuria (IMH) which is defined as persistent microscopic haematuria but without proteinura, hypertension, renal insufficiency, urinary tract infection or structural abnormality of the urinary tract, some patients have chronic glomerulonephritis (CGN), in whom early diagnosis by renal biopsy is beneficial to timely intervention. Nevertheless, a considerable number of patients with optimistic prognosis [e.g. thin basement membrane nephropathy (TBMN)] undergo invasive and needless renal biopsy. Indicators for weighing the necessity of renal biopsy would be clinically significant. To investigate the value of urinary albumin\/creatinine ratio (UACR), serum IgA level, serum C3 level and serum IgA to C3 ratio in predicting the necessity of renal biopsy for adult patients with IMH, 216 patients were studied retrospectively. Patients were divided into: (CGN group, n=137), (TBMN group, n=56) and normal biopsy (normal group, n=23). Of all patients, 131 (61%) evidenced microalbuminuria (UACR=30-299 mg\/g) and 85 (39%) had normoalbuminuria (UACR<30 mg\/g). The mean value of UACR in CGN group was higher (96+\/-17 mg\/g) compared with that in TBMN (20+\/-4 mg\/g, p<0.01) or normal (18+\/-3 mg\/g, p<0.01) group. The mean values of serum IgA and serum IgA\/C3 ratio in patients with IgA nephropathy (IgAN) were significantly higher than those with non-IgAN (380+\/-103:217+\/-99 mg\/dl, p<0.01; 4.5+\/-1.2 : 2.4+\/-0.9, p<0.01). The odds ratio for distinguishing IgAN from non-IgAN was significantly correlated with serum IgA level and serum IgA to C3 ratio. For adult patients with IMH, UACR, serum IgA level and serum IgA to C3 ratio are non-invasive markers for predicting the necessity of renal biopsy.",

        "Abstract":"Outcomes in children with proliferate lupus nephritis (PLN) show 9-15% progress to end-stage renal disease (ESRD) at 5 years. Immunosuppression improves outcome, but significant side effects are possible. Clinical and laboratory analyses are poor predictors of class and progression in PLN. We describe 28 patients with systemic lupus erythematosus (SLE), between 1990 and 2005, whose initial biopsy (Bx1) showed PLN and who received nine monthly doses of intravenously administered cyclophosphamide (CYP) (500-750 mg\/m(2) up to 1 g to maintain their absolute neutrophil count (ANC) > 3,000). Continued therapy with additional quarterly intravenous (i.v). administration of CYP was dictated by repeat renal biopsy (Bx2). Bx1 was done 1 +\/- 1.6 years after diagnosis of SLE. Bx2 showed histological improvement by WHO classification in 20\/25 children; 3\/25 were unchanged, 1\/25 was categorized as new class V, and 1\/25 was worse. Four patients (14%) had infectious complications requiring hospitalization (one of these died). Mean follow-up (f\/u) after Bx2 was 3.5 +\/- 2.3 years. At last follow-up, 26 patients had normal glomerular filtration rate (GFR), with a mean of 126 +\/- 42.8 ml\/min per 1.73 m(2) body surface area, one non-compliant patient had ESRD, and one had chronic renal failure. At last follow-up, most patients had minimal to no proteinuria. Clinical and biopsy results greatly improved after 9 monthly intravenously administered CYP pulses in most children with class IV PLN. Those who did not improve are at risk for flares and progression of disease. The tailoring of therapies based on findings from a biopsy after induction may improve outcomes.",

In contrary to the adult patients whose major cause of renal artery stenosis (RAS) is atherosclerosis, fibromuscular dysplasia is responsible for the renovascular hypertension in most children. Mid-aortic syndrome (MAS) is a rare abnormality referring to an isolated disease of the distal thoracic and abdominal aorta resulting in significant tubular narrowing with stenosis of the visceral and renal arteries. It is usually diagnosed in young adults, but may present in childhood as a challenging problem. Patients with MAS are often first detected due to refractory hypertension. Other later presentations include intermittent claudication, congestive heart failure, renal insufficiency and symptoms of hypertensive associated end-organ damage. We report a case of a 16-year-old patient with MAS who suffered from malignant arterial hypertension. A percutaneous transluminal renal angioplasty (PTRA) was first performed, however the stenosis proved resistant to dilatation and only resulted in a minimal angiographic improvement. Due to persistent hypertension, an aortorenal bypass using the saphenous vein was performed. We also reviewed the literature on PTRA and the surgical management of RAS in MAS patients, in which PTRA often carries poor results.",

        "Abstract":"BACKGROUND: The aim of this study was to investigate the HCV genotypes, hepatic siderosis, inflammatory activity and fibrosis of the liver in patients with chronic renal failure (CRF) on haemodialysis in Brazil.\nMETHODS: A cohort of 72 CRF patients was compared with a group of 65 candidates for blood donation (CBD). For the subjects selected, who tested positive for anti-HCV antibodies and were HCV-PCR positive, a protocol with epidemiological, clinical and laboratory information was completed. An ultrasound-guided liver biopsy was performed and histological analysis of liver fragments was carried out. The presence of HCV-RNA in plasma was established by nested-RT-PCR. The genotype was determined by Restriction Fragment Length Polymorphism (RFLP) analysis of the PCR product.\nRESULTS: HCV genotype 1 was predominant in both groups, but genotype 2 was the second most common amongst CRF patients, and there was a significant difference when compared with the CBD group (P=0.016). Regarding inflammation and fibrosis, no significant difference was observed in the histology of the liver between the study groups. Siderosis of the liver was more prevalent in the CRF group (P=0.000). Severe complications of liver biopsies were reported in 10 CRF patients (13.2%).\nCONCLUSIONS: Genotype 2 was observed more frequently in the haemodialysis group. No statistically significant difference was detected between the CRF and CBD groups with regard to both inflammatory response and liver fibrosis. Hepatic siderosis has been attributed to excessive iron administration. As percutaneous liver biopsy resulted in severe complications, we suggest that other procedures of evaluating liver damage in CRF patients should be looked at thoughtfully.",

Over the next 3 months, she simultaneously developed renal insufficiency dysphagia and hoarseness of voice. Biopsies from the gastric antrum, duodenum, bone marrow, and kidney were positive for vascular deposition of amyloid. Ultrasound of the thyroid revealed diffuse enlargement of the thyroid gland, which was 32.8 ML in volume, with diffuse hyperechogenicity. Fine needle aspiration (FNA) biopsy was positive for amyloid by Congo red staining, and cytology was negative for malignancy. The patient was treated with dexamethasone 40 mg daily on days 1-4, 9-12, and 17-20 for 3 months. On 3-month follow-up, the patient's nausea and vomiting had resolved and renal insufficiency improved. Ultrasound of the thyroid demonstrated decrease in the size of the goiter to 23.2 ML. Amyloid goiter is seen only in approximately 0.04% of patients with primary systemic amyloidosis.

        "Abstract":"Alport syndrome (AS) is genetically heterogeneous. The gene COL4A5 is mutated in the more frequent X-linked dominant form of the disease whereas COL4A3 or COL4A4 are mutated in the autosomal recessive and dominant forms. Diagnosis of AS and determination of the mode of transmission are important because of the differences in prognosis and genetic counselling attached to these different forms. Recently, promising results have been obtained in Col4a3-null mice, an animal model for AS, with different therapeutic trials when administered early in the course of the disease, an additional reason for making early diagnosis of AS in children. Since the identification of the molecular basis of the disease, mutation screening is theoretically the best diagnostic approach, avoiding the use or renal or skin biopsy. However, for many reasons linked to the genetic heterogeneity of the disease, the large size of the three genes and the random distribution of the mutations all along these huge genes, this method is tedious, expensive and time consuming. Moreover, its sensitivity is reduced. For these reasons, evaluation of the expression of type IV collagen chains in the skin, and if necessary in the renal basement membrane, remains a useful tool for AS diagnosis. At this time, the indication for these different approaches, which are not mutually exclusive but complementary, depends on the patient clinical presentation and family history.",

We aimed at identifying patterns of glomerular disease frequency, as well as the corresponding changes over time. The patients were grouped for analysis in 9-year intervals: period A (1977 through 1985), period B (1986 through 1994) and period C (1995 through 2003).\nRESULTS: Nephrotic syndrome was the most common clinical presentation for RB (42.0%), followed by urinary abnormalities (28.5%), acute renal failure (9.7%), chronic renal failure (9.3%) and nephritic syndrome (9.3%). Primary glomerulonephritis (GN) was the most common type of kidney disease in the present study, representing 50.4% of all renal pathology, followed by secondary GN (29.4%) and vascular and tubulointerstitial diseases (14.0%). The relative frequency of secondary GN and vascular and tubulointerstitial diseases increased significantly over time, and so did IgA nephropathy, the most common type of primary glomerular disease in the present study (31.2%). Focal and segmental glomerulosclerosis represented 6.9% of primary glomerular disease, and its frequency did not increase in the time period under study. Regarding secondary glomerular diseases, apparent changes were noted in the incidence of a number of diseases, including vasculitis, thin glomerular basement membrane disease and Henoch-Schönlein pur-pura. A somewhat similar situation was noted with vascular and tubulointerstitial diseases.\nCONCLUSIONS: We conclude that, as occurs in other European and Asiatic populations, and unlike the findings in the American continent, IgA nephropathy is the most frequent glomerular disease in our population.",

The lesion was defined as a nodule with a completely necrotic core and fibrous capsule etc. and without a consistency of viable cells. The characteristic features of this benign lesion on the imaging modalities are similar to the metastatic tumor. In this paper we discuss the case of a rapid-growing solitary necrotic nodule of the liver occurring in a patient with chronic renal failure on hemodialysis. The lesion located on the left median lobe of the liver had rapidly enlarged in diameter in the last seven months. Despite some examinations by imaging modalities to confirm the preoperative diagnosis, we were unable to visually confirm. Several histological examinations using a needle biopsy specimen were performed, but the diagnosis was all necrotic tissue. However, we recommended an extended left hepatic lobectomy for this rapid-growing lesion since cholangiocarcinoma with necrosis could be hardly differentiated. Permanent histology revealed that the lesion was solitary necrotic nodule. We consider that permanent histology of the entire lesion is possibly the only accurate method of diagnosis. Since the solitary necrotic nodule does not indicate malignancy, hepatic resection should be performed.",

        "Abstract":"OBJECTIVE AND METHODS: There is a growing interest in the safety and efficacy of percutaneous kidney biopsy for outpatients in Taiwan. We conducted a retrospective study for patients receiving the biopsy in 2002 and 2003. Complication and mortality associated with the biopsy were compared between 147 inpatients and 183 outpatients who had been judged to need no hospitalization. All biopsies were performed using the ultrasound guidance and an automated spring-loaded biopsy device.\nRESULTS: There were no death and no significant difference in complication rates between the two groups. No delayed gross hematuria, delayed pain, fever or biopsy site bleeding developed in outpatients, who were followed-up by telephone contacts for 1 - 5 days after they had been discharged. Both outpatients and inpatients with hematoma were younger than those without (p < 0.05). Template bleeding time was longer for inpatients with hematuria compared with inpatients without (12.0 vs. 5.8 minutes in average, p = 0.036), but not for outpatients (4.5 vs. 6.0 minutes in average, p = 0.282). There were moderate differences in platelet count between outpatients with hematuria and those without (p = 0.057), and in serum creatinine between inpatients with hematuria and those without (p = 0.069).\nCONCLUSION: The outpatient renal biopsy appears to be equally as safe and efficient as the inpatient biopsy. However, we suggest checking template bleeding time and platelet count before biopsy for patients with clinical bleeding tendency, such as patients with a serum creatinine level over 4 mg\/dl (approaching CKD stages IV, V) due to a higher risk of prolonged bleeding time.

        "Abstract":"BACKGROUND: Subclinical rejection (SCR) causes chronic allograft damage, which may be prevented by antirejection therapy.\nMETHODS: A pilot study of the effect of routine treatment of SCR was performed in 88 recipients of either a kidney (n=59) or combined kidney-pancreas transplant (n=29) undergoing protocol biopsy (PBX) surveillance at 1 and 3 months, using calcineurin inhibitors, mycophenolate mofetil, and corticosteroid therapy.\nRESULTS: SCR was seen in 46.6% (41\/88 patients), as 30 borderline and 11 acute SCR. From 279 transplant biopsies, the prevalence of SCR was 25% (22\/88) at 1 month, 10.2% (9\/88) at 3 months, and 8.3% (2\/24) at 12 months PBX. Treatment included bolus intravenous or oral corticosteroids (n=20) and augmented immunosuppression, either by conversion to tacrolimus (n=6) or increased doses of maintenance therapy (n=14), whereas OKT3 was used in one case of subclinical vascular rejection. Borderline episodes were not treated in 12 patients. In biopsies taken to assess therapeutic response, persistent SCR was present in 46.1% (6\/13). Treatment of SCR at 1 month was followed by lower acute Banff sum scores at 3 months PBX (P<0.01-0.0001). Early chronic damage was already present in the 1 month PBX, associated with SCR (P<0.0005 versus without SCR), although by 3 months these differences were lost. Rates of opportunistic infections and BK nephropathy were not increased by SCR treatment.\nCONCLUSION: Early chronic allograft damage was associated with SCR and therapy appeared to ameliorate further immune-mediated injury, although the efficacy of corticosteroids alone may be inadequate. A controlled trial of therapy for SCR is warranted.",

Thin glomerular basement membrane disease was detected in 127 (27.5%) cases and IgA nephropathy in 121 (26.2%) cases. Among those 461 children, microscopic haematuria was observed in 289 (62.7%) patients, proteinuria in nine (2.0%), and both in 163 (35.4%). In addition, a statistically higher rate of pathological abnormalities on renal biopsy was noted in the group with microscopic haematuria combined with proteinuria and also in cases with more severe haematuria.\nCONCLUSION: School urinary mass screening has greatly contributed to diagnosing chronic renal diseases.

        "Abstract":"Subclinical rejection (SCR) is diagnosed by protocol histology with a maximal prevalence occurring early after transplantation, falling to low levels by 1 year. Needle-core biopsy is safe, and the histology obtained fairly reflects subclinical immune activity. Several studies have consistently shown that SCR is associated with chronic tubulointerstitial damage, subsequent renal dysfunction and reduced graft survival. SCR is effectively treated by pulse corticosteroid therapy, although increased baseline immunosuppression may be necessary. A single randomized clinical trial of biopsy and corticosteroid therapy demonstrated significantly improved early structural and functional outcomes, and a (nonsignificant) 17% risk reduction in 4-year graft survival. Three possible approaches include: no protocol biopsies (usually accompanied by powerful immunosuppression); biopsies only in high-risk recipients (who may be difficult to reliably predict) or universal screening protocol biopsy (comprehensive but limited by cost and resource utilization). The appropriate screening methodology for a transplant unit is both a clinical and an economic decision; influenced by the SCR prevalence and potential gains of treatment, against costs and resource utilization. Further trials to quantify the cost-benefit balance in a typical, heterogeneous recipient population using modern immunosuppression are required.",

        "Abstract":"BACKGROUND: In the absence of a renal biopsy registry, there is a paucity of data on the renal disease pattern seen in India. This study reviews the changing pattern of renal disease seen at a single center over the last 30 yrs.\nMETHODS: Histopathological data of 5415 adequate native kidney biopsies performed on consecutive adult Indian patients presenting to our hospital from 1986-2002 were analyzed. This pathological demography classified according to the modified World Health Organization (WHO) classification was compared to the earlier published cohort collected from 1971-1985 (n=2827) to ascertain the changing trends.\nRESULTS: The indications for renal biopsy were comparable between the cohorts and included nephrotic syndrome (65%), nephritic syndrome (13%) and chronic renal failure (10.2%). Primary glomerular disease accounted for 71% of all biopsies. Non-immunoglobulin A (IgA) mesangio proliferative glomerulonephritis as a group was the predominant pathology (20.2%), followed by idiopathic focal segmental glomerulosclerosis (FSGS) (17%), minimal change disease (MCD) (11.6%), membranous glomerulopathy (MN) (9.8%), IgA nephropathy (8.6%) and membranoproliferative glomerulonephritis (MPGN) (3.7%). Of the patients with secondary kidney diseases, lupus nephritis (6.5%), diabetic nephropathy (2.5%), interstitial nephropathy (2.5%) and benign nephrosclerosis (2.2%) were notable. During the 31 yrs of the study period, there was a steady increase in FSGS prevalence (p<0.001), MN (p<0.0001), and post infectious glomerulonephritis (PIGN) (p<0.001). A reduction in the frequency of MPGN (p<0.001) and MCD (p<0.001) was observed.\nCONCLUSIONS: This is the largest series of renal biopsy data from India; and therefore, could reflect the demographic picture of renal diseases in this country. It discusses evolving patterns over 30 yrs and highlights differences with the developed world. This report represents the basis for the future of a renal biopsy registry in India.",

The average serum creatinine was 2.9 mg\/dl, with values > 3.5 mg\/dl in 25% of cases. The major indication to biopsy was nephrotic syndrome followed by chronic renal failure both in the young adult and the elderly population. The rapidly progressive form led more often to renal biopsy in the elderly patients, and the different prevalence was statistically significant (p < 0.05), as was the higher prevalence of urinary anomalies in the young-adult population. Regarding renal histology, the crescentic necrotizing forms were significantly more frequent in the elderly patients, while IgAN, minimal change disease and SLE predominate in young adults. The most relevant result is the greater prevalence of crescentic necrotizing glomerulonephritis in elderly patients, not only in the cases presenting clinically as rapidly progressive renal failure and acute renal failure, but also in those with the clinical picture of chronic renal failure.\nCONCLUSIONS: Re-evaluation of our case files verifies the importance of the bioptic approach in selected cases with stages 3-4 chronic kidney damage.

        "Abstract":"Deterioration of renal function is correlated with irreversible damage in chronic diseases. Recently we described a digital quantitative histochemistry method, relying on periodic acid methenamine silver (PAMS) staining to determine the chronic renal lesions. This index was strongly correlated with progressive deterioration of renal function in grafts with chronic allograft nephropathy (CAN). Herein the method has been applied to a cohort of renal allografts which were biopsied for various reasons, we sought to highlight its value to quantify chronic graft damage. Forty-four renal allograft biopsies from 37 patients with elevated serum creatinine values (SCr) underwent light microscopic image analysis (Mediscope, Dokuz Eylül University, Clinical Engineering Department, Izmir, Turkey) of the PAMS-stained area percentage (SAP). SCr was recorded at four intervals to overcome acute effects: the under SCr value before (SCr1) and after a biopsy within 3 months (SCr3), SCr at the time of the biopsy (SCr2), and the latest value (SCr4). The PAMS-SAP scores were strongly associated with increased interstitial fibrosis and tubular atrophy Banff scores (Kruskal-Wallis test, P = .006 and P = .003, respectively). There was a moderate positive correlation between PAMS and SCr3 (Pearson correlation test, P = .04, r = .312), and a strong positive correlation between time from transplantation to biopsy (Pearson correlation test, P << .000, r = .532). The present results show that PAMS-SAP seems to be of value to quantify renal scarring in allograft biopsies, reflecting four compartments. The strong correlation with time is noteworthy especially as a probable reflection of aging of the renal allograft.",

We analyze the predictive value of SCR and\/or CAN in protocol biopsies on death-censored graft survival. Since 1988, a protocol biopsy was done during the first 6 months in stable grafts with serum creatinine <300 micromol\/L and proteinuria <1 g\/day. Biopsies were evaluated according to Banff criteria. Borderline changes and acute rejection were grouped as SCR. CAN was defined as presence of interstitial fibrosis and tubular atrophy. Mean follow-up was 91 +\/- 46 months. Sufficient tissue was obtained in 435 transplants. Biopsies were classified as normal (n = 186), SCR (n = 74), CAN (n = 110) and SCR with CAN (n = 65). Presence of SCR with CAN was associated with old donors, percentage of panel reactive antibodies and presence of acute rejection before protocol biopsy. Cox regression analysis showed that SCR with CAN (relative risk [RR]: 1.86, 95% confidence interval [CI]: 1.11-3.12; p = 0.02) and hepatitis C virus (RR: 2.27, 95% CI: 1.38-3.75; p = 0.01) were independent predictors of graft survival.

Since chemokines play pivotal roles in this process, our prospective study was performed to evaluate further the role of the chemokine receptor CXCR3.\nMETHODS: A total of 138 biopsies were included from patients without rejection and unaltered morphology (according to Banff 97 classification grade 1, n = 49), with acute interstitial rejection (Banff grade 4 type I, n = 8), with acute vascular rejection (Banff grade 4 type II, n = 23), with chronic allograft nephropathy (Banff grade 5, n = 16), without rejection but with various other lesions (Banff grade 6, n = 36) and from pre-transplant kidneys (n = 6). The expression of CXCR3-, CD4- and CD8-positive cells was localized by immunohistochemistry and quantified by image analysis.\nRESULTS: CXCR3 was expressed by infiltrating inflammatory cells, but not by intrinsic renal structures. CXCR3-positive cells were found to be involved in tubulitis and vascular rejection. The area of CXCR3-positive staining was significantly larger in biopsies with acute interstitial rejection (P<0.001) and acute vascular rejection (P<0.001) as compared with normal renal graft biopsies. There was a strong morphological and numerical correlation between CXCR3 and both CD4- and CD8-positive T cells, respectively.\nCONCLUSIONS: A significant part of both CD4- and CD8-positive T cells express the chemokine receptor CXCR3.

        "Abstract":"The authors present a patient with Fabry syndrome that remained undiagnosed for several years. Fabry syndrome is a genetic disease related to changes on the X chromosome. Its complex clinical presentation and diverse symptomatology is caused by deficient activity of lysosomal hydrolase alpha-galactosidase enzyme. Defect in the basic alpha-galactosidase molecule implies genetic change, which can be a predisposing factor for the development of atypical and typical forms of this genetic disease. In the presented case, clinical manifestation and hemizygous symptomatology were the evidence of metabolic and genetic irregularity, typical clinical presentation of Fabry disease. Many authors report generalized vasculopathy as a basic characteristic of Fabry disease and a causative factor of multiorgan changes. Some authors indicate that persons with diagnosed asymmetric hypertrophy of the left ventricle have decreased alpha-galactosidase. Cardiac complications, coronary disease, and acute myocardial ischemia are often present in cases of Fabry disease, frequently causing death in such patients. Characteristic central nervous system symptoms with skin-burning sensation and paresthesia were also present in our case. Cerebrovascular complications were caused by changes on small blood vessels. Clinical signs of renal failure were nonspecific, and the diagnosis was based on extrarenal symptoms. Initial renal manifestations were insignificant as asymptomatic proteinuria and microhematuria, due to which our patient was referred to further examination. The level of alpha-galactosidase was significantly decreased. The severity and progression of this disease depends on the level of alpha-galactosidase enzyme in serum and its catabolic effect. More recent studies have showed that deficient enzyme can be synthetic zed and, accordingly our patient has been successfully enrolled in the replacement therapy program.",

        "Abstract":"Progression of kidney damage was studied in 18 patients with Balkan endemic nephropathy (BEN), with a mean 15-year follow-up after renal biopsy. According to kidney function, estimated by 99mTc-DTPA clearance, patients were divided into three groups: with apparently normal kidney function (clearance 103.5+\/-21.3 mL\/min\/1.73 m2), with incipient renal failure (clearance 65.5 +\/- 11.3), and with advanced renal failure (clearance 28.0+\/-6.2). The mean yearly decrease of glomerular filtration rate was 2.74 mL\/min. In two patients, an increase of kidney function was recorded. Six patients become dialysis dependent, two from the group with incipient renal failure, but all four from the group with advanced renal failure. Three patients died after 8 to 12 years of follow-up, one from causes unrelated to kidney disease and two from end-stage renal failure. This study has shown that BEN is characterized by a slow course and prolonged evolution, modified by medical supervision and treatment.",

        "Abstract":"BACKGROUND: Epidemiological data of renal disease are available from large national renal biopsy registries from Central and Western European countries; in contrast, detailed epidemiological data from Eastern European countries are missing. This report is the first review of histological data, over a period of 10 years (1995-2004), covering a population of over 6 million inhabitants and two distinct regions from an East European country - Romania.\nMETHODS: 635 eco-guided kidney biopsies from the Moldova (North-Eastern Romania, 8 counties, 4 754 048 inhabitants) and Banat (Western Romania, 3 counties, 1 454 747 inhabitants) regions were analysed. Data on serum creatinine concentration (sCr), 24 h proteinuria, haematuria, clinical diagnosis, histological diagnosis and complications after renal biopsy were collected.\nRESULTS: The number of biopsies performed varied between 10.9 p.m.p.\/year in 1995 and 11.3 p.m.p.\/year in 2004. The most common clinical syndromes - as indication for performing the renal biopsy - were: nephrotic syndrome (52.3%), followed by nephritic syndrome (21.9%), acute renal failure (ARF) (12.4%), chronic kidney disease (CKD) (10.2%) and asymptomatic urinary abnormalities (AUA) (3.3% of the cases). The major histological groups identified were: primary glomerulonephritis (GN) (66.2%), secondary GN (26.4%), vascular nephropathies (2.3%), and tubulointerstitial nephropathies (TIN) (1.5%) of the cases. Among primary GN's, the most frequent diagnoses were: membranoproliferative GN (MPGN) (29.4%, incidence in 2004 - 9.3 p.m.p.\/year), mesangioproliferative GN (MesGN) (28.9%, incidence - 10 p.m.p.\/year), membranous GN (MGN) (11.2%, incidence - 5.3 p.m.p.\/year), minimal change disease (MCD) (8.5%, incidence - 7.3 p.m.p.\/year), focal and segmental glomerulosclerosis (FSGS) (11.5%, incidence - 3.3 p.m.p.\/year) and crescentic GN (CGN) (7.9%, incidence - 3.3 p.m.p.\/year). The prevalence of membranoproliferative GN significantly decreased from 1995 to 2004. The prevalence of different types of secondary GN was similar to Western and Central European countries, with the particular difference of higher infectious diseases associated GN.\nCONCLUSION: The present data are an important contribution to the epidemiology of renal diseases in Europe, highlighting not only numerous similarities but also significant epidemiological differences in Western and Central European countries, particularly a higher, albeit declining, incidence and prevalence of membranoproliferative GN. This report represents the basis for the future of Romanian Registry of Renal Biopsies and is intended to serve as a source of information for nephrologists concerned with East European renal pathology.",

        "Abstract":"Chronic allograft nephropathy (CAN) represents the main cause of renal allograft loss after 1 yr of transplantation. Calcineurin inhibitor (CNI) use is associated with increased graft expression of profibrotic cytokines, whereas rapamycin inhibits fibroblast proliferation. The aim of this randomized, prospective, open-label, single-center study was to evaluate the histologic and clinical effect of rapamycin on biopsy-proven CAN. Eighty-four consecutive patients who had biopsy-proven CAN and received a transplant were randomized to receive either a 40% CNI reduction plus mycophenolate mofetil (group 1; 50 patients) or immediate CNI withdrawal and rapamycin introduction with a loading dose of 0.1 mg\/kg per d and a maintaining dose aiming at through levels of 6 to 10 ng\/ml (group 2; 34 patients). The follow-up period was 24 mo. At the end of follow-up, 25 patients (group 1, 10 patients; group 2, 15 patients) underwent a second biopsy. CAN lesions were graded according to Banff criteria. alpha-Smooth muscle actin (alpha-SMA) protein expression was evaluated in all biopsies as a marker of fibroblast activation. Graft function and Banff grading were superimposable at randomization. Graft survival was significantly better in group 2 (P = 0.0376, chi2 = 4.323). CAN grading worsened significantly in group 1, whereas it remained stable in group 2. After 24 mo, all group 1 biopsies showed an increase of alpha-SMA expression at the interstitial and vascular levels (P < 0.001); on the contrary, alpha-SMA expression was dramatically reduced in group 2 biopsies (P = 0.005). This study demonstrates that rapamycin introduction\/CNI withdrawal improves graft survival and reduces interstitial and vascular alpha-SMA expression, slowing down the progression of allograft injury in patients with CAN.",

        "Published":"2005-10-19",
        "Abstract":"Alport posttransplantation anti-glomerular basement membrane (GBM) nephritis is mediated by alloantibodies against the noncollagenous (NC1) domains of the alpha3alpha4alpha5(IV) collagen network, which is present in the GBM of the allograft but absent from Alport kidneys. The specificity of kidney-bound anti-GBM alloantibodies from a patient who had autosomal recessive Alport syndrome (ARAS) and developed posttransplantation nephritis was compared with that of Goodpasture autoantibodies from patients with autoimmune anti-GBM disease. Allograft-eluted alloantibodies reacted specifically with alpha3alpha4alpha5 NC1 hexamers, targeting their alpha3NC1 and alpha4NC1 subunits, and recognized a noncontiguous alloepitope formed jointly by the E(A) and E(B) regions of alpha3NC1 domain. In contrast, human Goodpasture autoantibodies recognized the separate E(A) and E(B) autoepitopes of alpha3NC1 but not the composite alloepitope. Molecular modeling of alpha3NC1 revealed that the alloepitope is more accessible within the NC1 hexamers than the partially sequestered Goodpasture autoepitopes. Overall, the specificity of alloantibodies indicated a selective lack of immune tolerance toward the alpha3 and alpha4(IV) collagen chains not expressed in patients with ARAS. Using COL4A3 knockout mice, a model of ARAS, it was shown further that acid-dissociated rather than native alpha3alpha4alpha5 NC1 hexamers elicited murine anti-GBM antibodies most closely resembling human ARAS alloantibodies. In contrast, alpha3NC1 monomers elicited Goodpasture-like murine antibodies, targeting the E(A) and E(B) autoepitopes. Thus, the identity of alpha3NC1 epitopes targeted by anti-GBM antibodies is strongly influenced by the molecular organization of the immunogen. These findings suggest that different isoforms of alpha3(IV) collagen may be implicated in the pathogenesis of ARAS posttransplantation anti-GBM nephritis and Goodpasture disease.",

        "Abstract":"Apolipoprotein A-I amyloidosis is a rare, late-onset, autosomal dominant condition characterized by systemic deposition of amyloid in tissues, the major clinical problems being related to renal, hepatic, and cardiac involvement. Described is the clinical and histologic picture of renal involvement as a result of apolipoprotein A-I amyloidosis in five families of Italian ancestry. In all of the affected family members, the disease was caused by the Leu75Pro heterozygous mutation in exon 4 of apolipoprotein A-I gene, as demonstrated by direct sequencing and RFLP analysis. Immunohistochemistry confirmed that amyloid deposits were specifically stained with an anti-apolipoprotein A-I antibody. The clinical phenotype was mainly characterized by a variable combination of kidney and liver disturbance. The occurrence of renal involvement seemed to be almost universal, although its severity varied greatly ranging from subclinical organ damage to overt, slowly progressive renal dysfunction. The renal presentation was consistent with a tubulointerstitial disease, as suggested by the findings of defective urine-concentrating capacity, moderate polyuria, negative urinalysis, and mild tubular proteinuria. Histology confirmed tubulointerstitial nephritis. Surprising, amyloid was restricted to nonglomerular regions and limited to the renal medulla. This location of apolipoprotein A-I amyloid differs sharply from other systemic amyloidoses that are mainly characterized by glomerular and vascular deposits. The tubulointerstitial nephritis as a result of hereditary apolipoprotein A-I amyloidosis is a rare disease and a challenging diagnosis to recognize. Patients who present with familial tubulointerstitial nephritis associated with liver disease require a high index of suspicion for apolipoprotein A-I amyloidosis.",

We describe the case of 20-year-old female with chronic renal failure undergoing hemodialysis during six years. Both x-rays and computer tomography revealed a tumor in head of right humerus and lytic images in scapula of the same side, clavicles and ribs. The patient was subjected to a fine needle aspiration biopsy of the tumor of humerus head and the sample was processed with the habitual technique of inclusion in paraffin and stained with hematoxilina and eosina. Histological preparations showed several multinucleate giant cells and spindly or fibrillary cells, feature that was pointed out as compatible, in a context of secondary hyperparathyroidism to chronic renal failure, with a BT.

Twenty-three of the 25 patients were men, and the median age was 59 years (range, 42-83 years). All had chronic renal damage, with a median index of chronic damage of 37% (range, 10-83%; normal=0%). Twenty-two neoplasms were papillary, two were clear cell renal carcinomas and one was in situ carcinoma in a collecting duct. The two clear cell carcinomas, three papillary neoplasms with residual masses after biopsy and the two papillary neoplasms in renal allografts were resected by nephrectomy or partial nephrectomy. Seven patients without resection were imaged with computerized tomography, six with magnetic resonance imaging and three with ultrasound scanning. Two were not imaged. None of the 11 patients who died, nor any of the other 14, had evidence of renal cell carcinoma at death or last follow-up respectively, at median 3.6 years after biopsy (range, 1 month-18.2 years).\nCONCLUSIONS: When an incidental neoplasm is found, the pathological type should be defined, and imaging should be performed. Surgery should be considered in patients in whom there is a neoplasm of any type detectable by imaging, and limited resection may be possible. Neoplasms that are undetectable with imaging cannot be resected as the site of the lesion is unknown. We suggest surveillance of these, but whether this is necessary is undetermined. There is no evidence whether neoplasms undetectable with imaging in renal allografts require aggressive treatment.",

This endoscopic finding is characterized by the appearance of parallel longitudinal red columns along mucosal folds, along with capillars dilatation and hemorrhagy. Finding reliable method for its recognition is of paramount importance. Patient B.D., a 54-year-old woman, developed renal failure, which led to hemodialysis treatment, on the basis of pyelonephritis chronica. As a consequence of the gastrointestinal bleeding, the patient had black stools and developed severe anemia. The endoscopic finding showed the existence of visible columns of vessels transversing the antrum in longitudinal folds and converging in the pylorus, with clear red spots and surrounding hyperemy covered by drops of fresh blood. The diagnosis of \"watermelon stomach\" was confirmed after the pathohistological examination of the tissue taken at the biopsy, followed by total gastrectomy. Postoperative status was normal, without gastrointestinal hemorrhagia, and she went on with hemodialysis. Before the surgery she received 105 blood transfusions, and after surgical treatment she has received only 18 so far. At the moment she is in good health condition, and on hemodialysis. The reason we have reported this case of \"watermelon stomach\" syndrome in patient with chronic renal failure is to indicate that this rare anomaly of gastric blood vessels can lead to gastrointestinal blood loss in these patients.

Spearman's correlation coefficient was used to determine the correlation between ALT and histologic variables. Sensitivity, specificity and positive and negative predictive values (PPV and NPV) of ALT in the detection of septal fibrosis and interface hepatitis, and\/or confluent necrosis were calculated.\nRESULTS: Fifty-three patients (32 men, 60%), with a mean age of 42 +\/- 10 yr and time since transplant of 5 +\/- 4 yr were included. Only 27 (51%) patients showed elevated ALT levels, which were associated with septal fibrosis (p = 0.001), interface hepatitis (p < 0.001) and confluent necrosis (p = 0.05). A correlation was observed between ALT and staging (r = 0.50, p < 0.001), periportal necroinflammatory activity (r = 0.59, p < 0.001) and lobular necroinflammatory activity (r = 0.50, p < 0.001).

There is also experimental evidence that aldosterone contributes to the development of nephrosclerosis and renal fibrosis in rodent models, but little is known of its role in clinical renal disease.\nMETHODS AND RESULTS: We quantified MR, serum- and glucocorticoid-regulated kinase 1 (sgk1), and mRNA expression of inflammatory mediators such as macrophage chemoattractant protein-1 (MCP-1), transforming growth factor-beta1, and interleukin-6 in 95 human kidney biopsies in patients with renal failure and mild to marked proteinuria of diverse etiologic origins. We measured renal function, serum aldosterone, urinary MCP-1 protein excretion, and the amount of chronic renal damage. Macrophage invasion was quantified by CD68 and vascularization by CD34 immunostaining. Serum aldosterone correlated negatively with creatinine clearance (P<0.01) and positively with renal scarring (P<0.05) but did not correlate with MR mRNA expression or proteinuria. Patients with heavy albuminuria (>2 g\/24 h; n=15) had the most renal scarring and the lowest endothelial CD34 staining. This group showed a significant 5-fold increase in MR, a 2.5-fold increase in sgk1 expression and a significant increase in inflammatory mediators (7-fold increase in MCP-1, 3-fold increase in transforming growth factor-beta1, and 2-fold increase in interleukin-6 mRNA). Urinary MCP-1 protein excretion and renal macrophage invasion were significantly increased in patients with heavy albuminuria.\nCONCLUSIONS: These studies support animal data linking aldosterone\/MR activation to renal inflammation and proteinuria. Further studies are urgently required to assess the potential beneficial effects of MR antagonism in patients with renal disease.",

        "Abstract":"INTRODUCTION: The presence of chronic allograft nephropathy (CAN) in protocol biopsies is negatively associated with graft survival. Although recent studies have indicated that the resistive index (RI) is a predictor of graft failure, it does not correlate with CAN in stable grafts. We therefore studied the relationship between RI and CAN and examined the predictive value of both parameters on graft outcome.\nMETHODS: Included were patients transplanted between 1997 and 2002 and who had protocol biopsies and RI determinations. Renal lesions were blindly evaluated according to Banff 97 criteria. Mean glomerular volume, cortical interstitial volume fraction and intimal arterial volume fraction were estimated using a point counting technique. RI was determined before biopsy in at least two different renal locations. The outcome variable was defined as graft failure or a 30% serum creatinine increase between protocol biopsy and last follow-up.\nRESULTS: Eighty-seven patients were included. RI correlated with recipient age (R = 0.52, P < 0.0001), diastolic blood pressure (R = -0.36, P = 0.0006), pulse pressure index (R = 0.27, P = 0.009) and g-score for histological glomerulitis (rho = 0.30, P = 0.0054), but there were no correlations between RI and chronic Banff scores or any morphometric parameter. The presence of CAN (relative risk, 3.5; 95% confidence interval 1.2-10.2; P = 0.02) but not RI was associated with the outcome variable.\nCONCLUSION: RI was associated with surrogate measures of vascular compliance such as recipient age and pulse pressure index but not with chronic allograft damage, even when it was evaluated by histomorphometry. Our results indicate that histology may be superior to RI in predicting graft function deterioration, at least in patients with stable renal function.",

        "Abstract":"Forty-two ESRD patients underwent renal transplantation using basiliximab (mean age: 30.6 +\/- 18.6 years at transplantation; male: 50%; ESRD duration: 51.6 +\/- 13.0 months) between February, 2000 and July, 2003. All patients had a protocol biopsy on the day of transplant, on discharge from the hospital (35.5 +\/- 13.2 days), and at 1 year after transplant. The immunosuppression included a calcineurin inhibitor, basiliximab, mycophenolate mofetil (MMF), and methylprednisolone. While 16 patients used tacrolimus (FK group: 29.4 +\/- 16.6 years old), 26 patients used cyclosporine (CsA group: 31.4 +\/- 20.1 years old). Protocol biopsies were graded according to the Banff 97 classification. The incidence of acute rejection episodes within 1 year was greater in the CsA (15%) than the FK group (6%). Serum creatinine at hospital discharge was similar (CsA: 1.01 +\/- 0.59 mg\/dL, FK: 0.97 +\/- 0.49, p = .18); however creatinine at 1 year differed significantly (CyA: 1.22 +\/- 0.88 mg\/dL, FK: 0.92 +\/- 0.39, P = .03). There was a trend toward an increase in the score of interstitial inflammations in the CsA group, while it remained constant in the FK cohort (P = .05 at 1 year between the two groups). Other pathologic scores (t, ci, ct, cv, ah) did not differ between the groups at 1 year. Although there were no differences in the demographics between the two groups, there were several trends toward better renal function in the FK group.",

In this paper the authors report the transmission of an undiagnosed sarcoma to recipients of kidney and liver grafts procured in a Maastricht category 3 non-heart beating donor. To the authors' knowledge this case is the first report of such a transmission with a liver graft procured in a non-heart beating donor. The cancer transferal was diagnosed 1 year after transplantation in the recipients of the liver and of one kidney. The liver recipient died from multiple organ failure after a failed attempt of tumor resection. The kidney recipient underwent immunosuppression withdrawal and transplantectomy. Non-heart beating donors should not be particularly at risk for undiagnosed cancer transmission if the procurement is performed according to the same rules of careful inspection of the abdominal and thoracic organs. After diagnosis of donor cancer transmission, kidney recipients should have the graft removed, and immunosuppression should be interrupted. The management of liver graft recipients is very difficult in this setting, and long-term survival was very rarely reported.",

Clinically the hemizygous patient had advanced renal disease with nephrotic range proteinuria and serum creatinine 122 micromol\/l. The female carrier had minimal albuminuria, borderline GFR with a normal serum creatinine, acroparesthesias, moderate fatigue, tinnitus and headache accompanied by ischemic cerebral lesions. Enzyme replacement therapy (ERT) was initiated according to our Fabry protocol, partly due to the renal morphologic findings. We conclude that FSGS and vascular changes may be an early morphologic finding in Fabry's disease, even in patients with subtle albuminuria. The potential role of FSGS as a marker of progressive renal disease in some Fabry patients is discussed. As FSGS and vascular changes obviously may exist across a wide range of clinical presentations and have potential prognostic implications, we suggest that a renal biopsy should be performed prior to enzyme replacement therapy in all adult Fabry patients with proteinuria of various levels. Efforts should be made to develop a scoring system to evaluate potential histologic markers. Protocol biopsies may have therapeutic implications and may provide valuable information in the evaluation of start and dosing of ERT.",

        "Abstract":"We present the case of a 69-year-old man with nephrotic syndrome and renal insufficiency, who developed lobular glomerulonephritis. An electron microscopy examination of a renal biopsy showed microtubular structures of 24 nm in diameter in the subendothelial space and the paramesangial area. These deposits were PAS-positive and Congo red-negative, and revealed predominantly positive staining for kappa light chain. There was no evidence of diseases with highly organized glomerular deposits, such as amyloidosis, cryoglobulinemia, systemic lupus erythematosus or paraproteinemia. Therefore, the patient was diagnosed to have immunotactoid glomerulopathy (ITG). During a seven-year course he has not developed any disease known to be associated with organized glomerular immune deposits. Hence, we believe ITG occurred as a primary glomerular disease in this case. We also highlight cases of ITG with microtubular deposits that have been reported in Japan, compare these cases to previous reports, and show that the characteristics of the Japanese cases are male predominance; a high incidence of membranoproliferative glomerulonephritis (MPGN); a low incidence of monoclonal gammopathy and hematological malignancies and a higher incidence of hypocomplementemia.",

        "Abstract":"INTRODUCTION: Transforming growth factor-beta (TGF-beta) is a well-known profibrotic factor playing a role in chronic kidney allograft nephropathy. Cyclosporine (CsA)-sparing immunosuppressive regimens may improve long-term graft function. Our aim was to study the influence of immunosuppressive treatment with versus without calcineurin inhibitors on serum TGF-beta levels and histological changes in protocol biopsies of kidney allograft recipients.\nPATIENTS AND METHODS: In this prospective, randomized study of 42 low-rejection risk patients we randomized two groups: group A: mycophenolate mofetil (MMF), prednisone, daclizumab, and reduced CsA dose for 7 months (5 mg per kg per day) followed by complete withdrawal (n = 21); and group B: normal CsA dose (10 mg per kg per day adjusted according to C2 levels), MMF, prednisone, and no daclizumab (n = 21).\nMETHODS: In both groups we performed histological assessments (Banff 97) and measured serum TFG-beta levels before as well as, at 3 and 12 months after transplantation.\nRESULTS: We found a relationship between immunosuppressive regimen and the TGF-beta concentration over 1 year of observation. Before transplant the TGF-beta1 levels did not differ between the groups (P = .29); at 3 months they were 33 +\/- 9 vs 49 +\/- 15 pg per mL, respectively, in groups A and B (P = .08), and at 12 months they were 39.5 +\/- 4 versus 55.5 +\/- 11 pg per mL, respectively, in groups A and B (P = .03). Protocol biopsies at 12 months in group B showed chronic tubular lesions more pronounced than in group A. TGF-beta1 concentrations were significantly higher among group B than A. We conclude that TGF-beta1 concentration may predict the development of kidney graft fibrosis; early CsA withdrawal may achieve a reduction in chronic tubular and interstitial injury of cadaveric kidney allografts.",

        "Abstract":"BACKGROUND: Various immunological and non-immunological pathomechanisms are responsible for the cellular damage in renal allografts. Since the kidney is an anatomically complex organ with functional and morphological heterogeneous compartments (interstitium, tubuli, vessels, glomeruli), the local response to injury maybe variable, therefore, the identification of local pathomechanisms is important.\nAIM: To elucidate any discrepancies in quantitative mRNA expression profiles between a total specimen analysis and a cell-specific evaluation after laser microdissection.\nMETHODS: Real-time RT-PCR was performed for complement component C3 and heme oxygenase-1 (HO-1) genes compared to the housekeeping gene beta-actin using whole section RNA extracted from formalin-fixed and paraffin-embedded archival material of 16 explanted, rejected renal allografts. Ten non-transplant nephrectomies served as controls. For five cases from each group, five different compartments of the organs (interstitium, proximal tubuli, distal tubuli, vessels, glomeruli) were microdissected and quantitative analysis for C3 and HO-1 was performed identically.\nRESULTS: Whole section mRNA expression analysis: the data showed a constant expression of the housekeeping gene beta-actin, a 7-fold increased expression of C3 and a 3-fold decreased expression of HO-1 in the allograft group as compared to the control group. mRNA expression results from microdissected compartments: in the control group, C3 and HO-1 expression could only be detected in the proximal tubuli of all cases whereas all five compartments analyzed from the rejecting kidneys showed expression of the two genes. In the allografts, expression levels of the investigated genes varied considerably not only among the different compartments but between individual cases as well.\nCONCLUSION: Laser microdissection combined with real-time RT-PCR is a feasible approach for retrospective quantitative gene expression analysis in formalin-fixed and paraffin-embedded renal allograft specimens. As shown for C3 and HO-1, cell-specific expression patterns ofpathogenetically relevant genes vary considerably between individual cases. A close correlation of morphology and cell-specific gene expression analysis will contribute to the elucidation of the complex pathogenesis of chronic renal allograft nephropathy.",

Twenty-two patients were included. The mean age was 55 years (range 29-76). The sex ratio (male to female) was 2.6 (they were 16 males and 6 females). The presenting clinical features were dominated by bone manifestations with diffuse pain (41%) followed by pathologic fractures (22.27%) and lumbar pain (13.6%). At the hospital admission the type of clinical manifestations recorded were related to bone (91% general (60%), neurologic (36%) and infection (36%). The biological exams documented an anemia in 20 cases (91%) and increased serum protein in 13 cases (59%) and hypercalcemia in 11 cases (50%) and renal insufficiency in 6 cases (27%). Immunoelectrophoresis had been performed in 6 cases and revaled 4 cases of IgG and 2 cases of light chain myeloma. On the skeletal radiological exams it has been found lytic bone lesions in 66.6 % of cases. diffuse bone rarefaction (38.88%), pathological fractures (38.88%) and vertebral collapses (18.18%). The bone marrow aspiration showed in 17 cases over 19 a medullary dystrophic plasmocytosis. According to the Salmon and Durie classification 68% of the patients were pointed in stage III. Comparing our results to the series, we figure out our patients younger at the time of the diagnosis and an important diagnosis delay as previously suggested in the African litterature. This is confirmed by the fact that 68% of patients were one Salmon and Durie stage III. the frequency of severe anemia and pathological fractures We invite practitionners to conduct systematic exploration of mild symptoms like lumbar pain.",

At our institution the first patient submitted to this technique, at 1994, showed Berger disease. Until 2002 we have performed 91 renal biopsies (57 men and 34 women) with the following annual distribution: 1994 (n=3), 1995 (n=3), 1996 (n=3), 1997 (n=15), 1998 (n=5), 1999 (n=23), 2000 (n=13) and 2001 (n=26). Ultrasound guidance was always used and in most of cases the technique was performed with Vim-Silverman (14G) needle. BARD automatic system was employed in only five patients. The clinical diagnosis that lead to renal biopsy were: nephrotic syndrome (n=27), asyntomatic urinary abnormalities (n=25), acute or rapidly progressive renal failure (n=18), chronic renal failure (n=15), hypertension (n=4) and acute nephritis (n=2). The efficacy for optic histological diagnosis was 92.3% (84\/91). However, if we include seven cases of presumed IgA nephropathy that don't included fragment for immunofluorescence (IF) analysis the efficacy declined to 84.6% (77\/91). The mean number of glomeruli per fragment was 18.3 -\/+ 14.2 [0-80]. Histological diagnosis were the following: Berger disease (n=24), idiopathic nephrotic syndrome (n=18), lupus nephritis (n=8), mesangial proliferative glomerulonephritis without glomeruli in the IF fragment (n=6), without glomeruli (n=6), secondary nephrotic syndrome (n=4), tubulointerstitial nephritis or acute tubular necrosis (n=4), diabetic nephropathy (n=3), myeloma kidney (n=3), pauci-imune and crescentic glomerulonephritis (n=3), hypertensive nephropathy (n=2), IgM mesangial proliferative glomerulonephritis (n=2) and various (n=8). Gross hematuria appeared in 9 patients (9.9%). Only in three of these patients it was showed, by ecography, the existence of kidney haematoma. Bleeding throughout the mandrill in four cases, leaded to transfusion in only three patients. We have registered one accidental spleen puncture. Nephrectomy for incontrollable bleeding was never needed. Higher glomerulosclerosis (30% vs 8%; p<0.01) and also a greater extent of tubulointersticial lesions (100% vs 63%; p<0.01), were predictors of progression into end-stage or advanced renal failure. Concluding, renal biopsy with ultrasound guidance was valuable for diagnosis in 84.6% of our proceedings. Our serie is similar to others concerning serious complications. Nephrologists and radiologists improved progressively their coordination performing this technique, improving the results during this period of 8 years.",

        "Abstract":"When renal disease develops, mineral and vitamin D homeostasis is disrupted, resulting in diverse modifications in bone cells, bone structure and the rate of bone turnover. In end stage renal failure (ESRF) when patients require chronic maintenance dialysis, nearly all of them have abnormal bone histology known as renal osteodystrophy (ROD). Moreover, survival rates of patients on dialysis have increased because of therapeutic improvement and the resultant increase in duration of dialysis has led to a further rise in renal osteodystrophy. Because metabolic bone disease can produce fractures, bone pain, and deformities late in the course of the disease, prevention and early treatment are essential. Serum PTH and various bone markers are commonly used to assess bone changes in ESRF patients, but the diagnosis of underlying bone disease is still rather uncertain. To date, bone biopsy is the most powerful and informative diagnostic tool to provide precise information on the type and severity of renal osteodystrophy, and on the presence and amount of aluminum and strontium deposited in the bone. Bone biopsy is not only useful in clinical settings but also in research to assess the effects of therapies on bone. Although considered an invasive procedure, bone biopsy has been proven to be safe and free from major complications, but the operator's experience and skill is important in further minimizing morbidity. Alternatives to bone biopsy continue to be sought, but the non-invasive bone markers have not been proven to be sufficient in diagnostic performance related to bone turnover, mineralization process and bone cell abnormality. Hence, transiliac bone biopsy remains the gold standard for the diagnosis of renal osteodystrophy.",

Thirty kidney biopsy specimens from children with idiopathic early FSGS were studied retrospectively. Unexpected, apoptosis was evident in both proximal and distal tubule cells. There was a significant correlation between the degree of proteinuria and the number of apoptotic cells. Fas protein was detected predominantly in the tubule cells that underwent apoptosis. When compared with patients with other chronic proteinuric states, those with FSGS displayed a proliferation\/apoptosis ratio in favor of proliferation in the glomerulus but dramatically in favor of apoptosis in the tubules. When both proteinuria and apoptosis were included in a stepwise logistic regression procedure, only apoptosis was found to predict independently the development of ESRD. Prolonged incubation of cultured Madin-Darby canine kidney (distal\/collecting) cells with albumin also resulted in a dose- and duration-dependent induction of apoptosis and activation of the Fas pathway, lending support to the novel finding of distal tubule cell apoptosis in patients with FSGS. The results indicate that an elevated tubule cell apoptosis rate at the time of initial biopsy represents an independent predictor of progression to ESRD in patients with early FSGS.",

The histopathological findings were reviewed to determine the pattern of biopsy-proven glomerulonephritis. The indications for biopsy, mode of therapy given after biopsy and the clinical outcome were studied.\nRESULTS: 122 adequate biopsies were received, 9 children had repeat biopsies. Of the 113 biopsies, minimal change disease formed the most common histopathological diagnosis (40.7%) while lupus nephritis formed the most common secondary glomerulonephritis (23.0%). The main indications for biopsy were nephrotic syndrome (50.8%), lupus nephritis (25.4%) and renal impairment (13.1%). The mode of therapy was changed in 59.8% of the children. Of 106 patients followed-up, 84 children were found to have normal renal function in remission or on treatment. 4 patients developed chronic renal impairment and 16 reached end stage renal disease. Five of the 16 children with end stage disease had since died while 11 were on renal replacement therapy. Another 2 patients died of other complications.\nCONCLUSIONS: The pattern of childhood GN in our study tended to reflect the more severe renal parenchymal diseases in children and those requiring more aggressive treatment. This was because of our criteria of selection (indication) for renal biopsy. Renal biopsy where performed appropriately in selected children may not only be a useful investigative tool for histological diagnosis and prognosis but may help clinicians plan the optimal therapy for these children.",

        "Abstract":"BACKGROUND: This report describes data collected by the Czech Registry of Renal Biopsies (CRRB).\nMETHODS: Twenty-eight centres provided data on all biopsies of native kidneys performed in the Czech Republic (population 10.3 million) over the period 1994-2000. Data on serum creatinine concentration (sCr), 24 h proteinuria, haematuria, serum albumin level, arterial hypertension, diabetes mellitus, histological diagnosis and complications after renal biopsy were collected.\nRESULTS: Altogether 4004 biopsies in 3874 patients were performed (males 57.9%, children < or = 15 years 17.7%, elderly >60 years 14.3%). Microhaematuria was present in 65.9%, macrohaematuria in 9.2%, nephrotic proteinuria (> or = 3.5 g\/24 h) in 39.3%, and low-grade proteinuria (<3.5 g\/24 h) in 41.4%. Among adults, hypertension was present in 45.2%, mild renal insufficiency in 23% (sCr 111-200 micromol\/l) and advanced renal insufficiency in 13.7% (sCr 201-400), while 11.5% of patients had sCr >400 micromol\/l. The most frequent renal diseases were primary (59.8%) and secondary (25.4%) glomerulonephritis (GN). Tubulointerstitial nephritis (TIN) was observed in 4.4% and hypertensive nephroangiosclerosis in 3.4%. The samples were non-diagnostic in 4.6%. Among primary GNs, the most frequent diagnoses were: IgA nephropathy (IgAN) 34.5%, minimal change disease (MCD) 12.4%, non-IgA mesangioproliferative GN (MesGN) 11.3%, focal segmental glomerulosclerosis (FSGS) 10.8% and membranous GN (MGN) 9.3%. Among secondary GNs, systemic lupus erythematosus (SLE) represented 23.0%, necrotizing vasculitis (NV) 15.5%, Henoch-Schonlein purpura 5.7%, thin basement membrane glomerulopathy (TBN) 19.3%, Alport syndrome 6.9%, renal amyloidosis 9.9% and myeloma kidney 2.9%. Among children, the most common were IgAN (19.2%), MCD (17.6%) and TBM glomerulopathy (12.3%), while among the elderly the most common were MGN (11.0%), NV (10.7%) and amyloidosis (9.6%). The most common in patients with nephrotic proteinuria were MCD (50.5%) among children, but IgAN (24.6%) in adults aged 16-60 years and MGN (16.8%) among the elderly. IgAN (21.3%) and FSGS (8.3%) were the most common diagnoses among patients with mild renal insufficiency, but TIN (11.6%) and NV (11.3%) were the most common in more advanced renal insufficiency. Since 1999, diabetic patients represented 12.2% of adults, with mean proteinuria 8.9 g\/24 h; diabetic glomerulosclerosis was found in 42.4% (with microhaematuria present in 66%) and non-diabetic renal diseases in 47.5% (IgAN in 17.5%, MGN and NAS in 11.1% and NV in 9.5%). The mean annual incidence (per million population) was: primary GN 32.4, secondary GN 13.8, IgAN 11.2, MCD 4.0, MesGN 3.7, FSGS 3.5, SLE 3.2, MGN 3.0, TBM 2.7, TIN 2.4 and NV 2.1. Ultrasound needle guidance was used in 56%, preferably in children (79%). The frequency of serious complications (gross haematuria, symptomatic haematoma, blood transfusion) remained at 3%.\nCONCLUSION: The CRRB provides important data on the epidemiology of GN based on a whole country population.",

        "Abstract":"The arteriovenous fistula can be a major and late complication of percutaneous renal biopsies of native kidneys. The incidence of arteriovenous fistulas appears to be low and has been infrequently mentioned in large series of biopsies although there are a number of individual reports. In most part of cases, no systemic effects of the arteriovenous fistulas were observed, so they close by themselves. Optimization of renal biopsy techniques aims not only at obtaining kidney tissue technically adequate for diagnosis, but at reducing biopsy-induced complications. When these complications are done, the new transvascular techniques can get the healing of fistula with the embolism by catheters. We describe the case of a 37-year-old woman who had chronic renal failure by a possible chronic glomerulonephritis. She developed deterioration of renal function after the percutaneous renal biopsy. An arteriovenous fistula of high flow was detected by Doppler ultrasound. Then, it was confirmed angiographically and closed by embolism's catheter without damage of renal tissue.",

        "Abstract":"BACKGROUND: Previous studies have evaluated transjugular renal biopsy in patients with contraindications to percutaneous renal biopsy or those undergoing simultaneous renal and hepatic biopsies. We sought to evaluate transjugular renal biopsy in patients with acute renal failure (ARF) or ARF in the presence of chronic renal insufficiency (CRI) who required venous catheter placement for hemodialysis (HD).\nMETHODS: Ten consecutive patients (6 patients, ARF; 4 patients, ARF on CRI) at a single tertiary-care medical center, while undergoing placement of HD access through the internal jugular route, also underwent transjugular renal biopsy using the Quick-Core (Cook, Bloomington, IN) system to delineate the cause of ARF. Transjugular renal biopsy was performed because it was the opinion of the attending nephrologist that a histological diagnosis might alter management.\nRESULTS: Renal biopsy findings were diabetic nephropathy (3 patients), acute tubular necrosis (ATN; 2 patients), nephrosclerosis (2 patients), immunoglobulin A nephropathy (1 patient), lupus nephritis with focal crescents and ATN (1 patient), and pauci-immune necrotizing glomerulonephritis (1 patient). There were no major complications from the procedures. Among the 6 patients with ARF, management was directly affected in 3 patients (either initiation of appropriate immunosuppressive therapy or withholding of such therapy). In the remaining 3 patients with ARF and in patients with ARF on CRI, performing transjugular renal biopsy at the time of HD access placement obviated additional testing and\/or unnecessary therapy. Four patients recovered renal function and HD therapy was discontinued, 2 patients died, and 1 patient was lost to follow-up.\nCONCLUSION: Simultaneous transjugular renal biopsy\/HD catheter placement should be considered in patients with ARF requiring HD therapy for whom knowledge of the renal histological diagnosis may alter patient management.",

        "Abstract":"Renal biopsy specimens of 13,519 cases were collected during the period of January 1979 to December 2002 from the Research Institute of Nephrology, Nanjing University School of Medicine, Nanjing, China. Analysis of the data of this group of patients showed that primary glomerulonephritis (GN) remained the most important and prevalent renal disease in China. The ratio of primary to secondary GN was 2.75:1. However, it is declining progressively in the past two decades with an increment in the incidence of diabetic nephropathy and nephrosclerosis. IgA nephropathy (IgAN) constituted 45.26% of the primary GN, while non-IgA mesangial proliferative lesions were 25.62%. Membranous nephropathy was 9.89% and minimal change disease was 0.93%, remarkably less. The most prevalent etiology of secondary GN was systemic lupus erythrematosus (SLE) (54.3%) followed by Henoch-Schönlein purpura (20.3%), diabetic nephropathy (6.6%), systemic vasculitides (4.0%), and amyloidosis (2.2%). Based on the study of biopsy materials obtained from 607 cases manifesting chronic renal failure, IgAN was identified as the most frequent cause (26.69%) of chronic renal failure.",

        "Abstract":"BACKGROUND: Although several registries collecting data of patients with kidney diseases exist, there are only a few registries which specifically collect data relating to renal biopsy; one such registry is the Italian Registry of Renal Biopsies (IRRB). The aim of this study was to report on the relative frequency of nephropathies according to gender, age at time of biopsy, clinical presentation and renal function, based on the histologic diagnosis during the years 1996 to 2000.\nMETHODS: We evaluated data relating to 14607 renal biopsies, provided by 128 renal units in Italy. Data entry was performed by using the Internet-based database directly (URL http:\/\/www.irrb.net). Clinical presentation was defined as urinary abnormalities (UA), nephrotic syndrome (NS), acute nephritic syndrome (ANS). Renal diseases were divided in four major categories: (1) primary glomerulonephritides (GN); (2) secondary GN; (3) tubulointerstitial nephropathies (TIN); and (4) vascular nephropathies (VN).\nRESULTS: Primary GN, TIN, and VN were more frequent in males compared to females while secondary GN was more frequent in females. Diseases whose frequency was higher in males were IgA nephropathy (IgAN), benign nephroangiosclerosis (BNA), and acute tubular necrosis (ATN). A significantly higher frequency of immune-mediated secondary GN, as well as primary GN, including minimal change disease (MCD), focal segmental glomerulosclerosis (FSGS), and mesangiocapillary GN (MCGN), was shown in females. Primary and secondary GN, TIN, and VN were more frequent in the range 15 to 65 years of age. At the time of biopsy 77% of primary GN and 61% of secondary GN presented with normal renal function. Acute renal failure (ACR) was more present in TIN (52%), while chronic renal failure (CRF) was more frequent in VN (47%).\nCONCLUSION: We believe collection of data relating to renal biopsies in a national registry is a useful tool for nephrologists in that it meets one of the current challenges facing the clinical research enterprise. The availability of these data will allow epidemiologic studies in health care to answer the several open questions in both prevention and treatment of renal diseases.",

        "Abstract":"After renal transplantation, different immunological and non-immunological factors lead to long-term allograft deterioration. Acute rejection episodes are one risk factor for chronic renal allograft dysfunction (CRAD). Following the current Banff classification the histological grade in acute rejection episodes is of limited prognostic value, therefore, additional morphological surrogate markers would be helpful. We investigated the biopsies of 91 patients with early acute rejection episodes for the immunohistochemical expression of key molecules (perforin, granzyme B, TIA-1, CD40) in the T cell-mediated rejection process. Staining results were correlated to long-term allograft outcome. Patients with greater than 2% of granzyme B or greater than 25% of CD40-positive cells in the interstitial infiltrate showed significantly shorter allograft survival. Patients with a CD40-positive vascular rejection or greater than 2% of granzyme B-positive cells in the interstitial infiltrate were significantly correlated with an earlier onset of CRAD. Our findings provide potential morphological surrogate markers in biopsies with early acute rejection episodes after renal transplantation. These could become part of combined clinical and histological algorithms, allowing patient-specific risk estimation and customized therapy options to be made.",

Previously we demonstrated the safety and effectiveness of ACEI treatment on the hypertensive proteinuric post-transplant patients (N = 10) who had been followed up for 12 months. However, not all patients show good response in urinary protein reduction. We aimed to analyse the histopathological factor(s) affecting the responsiveness of proteinuria to ACEI treatment. Fourteen post-transplant patients with proteinuria who were treated with ACEI and underwent allograft biopsy were analysed. Eight patients showed 50% or more reduction in proteinuria (responder). The other 6 patients showed less (< 50%) reduction in proteinuria (non-responder). There was no difference in clinical characteristics (BP, renal function, donor age, recipient body mass index), dietary sodium or protein intake, and diuretic use between the two groups. As a histopathological characteristic, glomerular size in responder group was significantly larger than that in non-responder group. This suggests that the large glomerular size at least partly contributes to the responsiveness in urinary protein reduction to ACEI treatment in kidney allograft recipients with proteinuria.",

This study investigated an age-related and disease-related symptom, restless sleep, among older African American and white members of two sociodemographically matched cohorts, community-dwelling older adults and older adults with chronic renal failure undergoing maintenance dialysis therapy. Sleep behaviors reflect age-dependent and disease-dependent homeostatic and circadian state regulation but are also socioculturally patterned. As hypothesized, restless sleep was significantly more characteristic of the older adults in the chronic disease cohort. With non-renal health conditions, depressed mood, perceived health, medication use, and sociodemographic variables controlled, however, African Americans were significantly less likely than whites in the chronic disease cohort to report restless sleep. African American and white patients differed in their expression of public and private religiousness, which in turn were associated, respectively, with depressed mood and restless sleep complaint. In addition, we suggest that differences for African American and white patients in the environmental exposure of chronic dialysis therapy, including African Americans' greater social integration within the dialysis treatment setting, contributed to their being less at risk than their white peers for subjective perception of sleep decay, a marker of overall well-being.",

In native kidney disease, treatment of hypertension, in particular with angiotensin-converting enzyme inhibitors (ACEi) or angiotensin receptor blockers (ARB), has proven beneficial in retarding renal function decline. In the present study, we reviewed the clinical course of a renal transplant recipient cohort that was prescribed either an ACEi or ARB for biopsy-proven allograft nephropathy.\nMETHODS: Patients were followed from the time of post-biopsy initiation of ACEi\/ARB and were stratified based on biopsy findings. Outcomes of interest included safety, allograft survival, renal function and change in slope of renal function pre- and post-ACEi\/ARB.\nRESULTS: The 5 year allograft survival after biopsy diagnosis of allograft nephropathy was 83%. Serum creatinine was 191+\/-97 (86-377) micromol\/l at the time of biopsy and 228+\/-102 (102-575) micromol\/l at last follow-up. The slopes of reciprocal creatinine vs time were used to calculate the decline in renal function and were compared pre- and post-ACEi\/ARB. The mean slope+\/-SD was -0.06+\/-0.21 l\/micromol x 10(-3) per month in the 12 months prior to therapy and -0.03+\/-0.09 l\/micromol x 10(-3) per month following therapy.

An 18-gauge Tru-cut transjugular needle with a 20-mm throw was used to obtain liver tissue. All procedures were performed under fluoroscopic guidance. A single pathologist reviewed the biopsy specimens and assessed the size of fragments, number of portal tracts, and adequacy of the specimens for histologic diagnosis. All complications were recorded. The results were compared with the outcomes of percutaneous liver biopsy carried out at our institution in 32 patients with ESRD.\nRESULTS: TJLB and percutaneous biopsy techniques yielded adequate specimens for histologic diagnosis in all patients. The mean length of the largest fragments of tissue obtained via the transjugular and percutaneous routes were 16 mm +\/- 4 and 14 mm +\/- 3, respectively (P = NS). There were no major complications among patients who underwent TJLB.

        "Abstract":"In this report of our 3-yr protocol biopsy program, we describe the evolution of acute rejection (AR) and chronic renal allograft nephropathy (CAN) in a cohort of 21 children treated with antibody induction, tacrolimus, mycophenolate mofetil, and prednisone. The aims of this study were to compare the pathogenicity of clinical acute rejection (CAR) and subclinical acute rejection (SAR), and to determine whether functional studies accurately represent acute and chronic renal allograft pathology in pediatric recipients with disproportionately large grafts. Using concurrent biopsies, we evaluated: (i) the utility of changes in the baseline sCr (DeltasCr) to predict both the onset of AR and the response to immunosuppressive therapy; and (ii) the relationship of the calculated creatinine clearance and the presence of pathologic proteinuria to the severity of CAN. We performed 112 biopsies: 11 donor, 73 protocol, 16 acute graft dysfunction and 12 1-month follow-up AR therapy. CAR and SAR were similar in incidence, timing and histologic severity. Progression of CAN was associated with the first episode of CAR (p < 0.02) and the cumulative number of episodes of CAR (p < 0.01), SAR (p < 0.05), CAR plus SAR (p < 0.002) and borderline SAR (B-SAR) (p < 0.006). One-month post-treatment DeltasCrs could not distinguish 1-month follow-up biopsies with histologically confirmed worsened or unchanged AR from those with improved histology (35.2 +\/- 74.8% vs. 23.8 +\/- 24.9%, p = NS). These findings led to the addition of anti-lymphocyte antibody therapy in five of 10 (50%) cases. Despite 100% 3-yr actuarial graft survival and excellent function (GFR = 111 +\/- 36 mL\/min\/1.73 m(2)), 18 of 21 (86%) patients had grade I CAN or greater chronic histology at a mean +\/- sd follow-up period of 18.2 +\/- 13.1 months. Thirteen of 21 (62%) patients progressed to grade I CAN at 5.2 +\/- 3.6 months and five (38%) of these patients progressed to grade II CAN at 17.8 +\/- 11.3 months. Schwartz GFR did not differ between patients with or without CAN (108 +\/- 38 mL\/min\/1.73 m(2) vs. 127 +\/- 8 mL\/min\/1.73 m(2), p = NS). In biopsies with CAN and no associated AR, neither the Banff chronic tubulointerstitial (Banff ci) score nor the Banff chronic grade correlated with the GFR. Proteinuria was not associated with CAN. Clinical AR and SAR are similar histologic lesions with a capacity for CAN progression. In pediatric renal transplant recipients, longitudinal protocol biopsies are superior to functional studies for the diagnosis and post-therapeutic monitoring of AR and for the surveillance of CAN.",

        "Abstract":"Fine-needle aspiration of abdominal fat pad (FNAFP) is commonly employed for the diagnosis of systemic amyloidosis, a disease with highly variable clinical manifestations, often presenting difficult patient management problems. We evaluated the role of FNAFP particularly in reference to its clinical usefulness. Pathology reports and clinical histories of 91 consecutive cases of FNAFP with Congo red (CR) staining at The Johns Hopkins Hospital (1999-2000) were reviewed. Major emphases were assessment of the clinical utility of the test, correlation with concurrent or subsequent biopsies, and treatment strategies. The primary indications for FNAFP were monoclonal gammopathy (34%), cardiomyopathy (22%), renal insufficiency (20%), neuropathy (8%), plasma cell dyscrasia (6%), and other conditions (10%). Of the 91 patients who underwent FNAFP, the results were as follows; 20 cases (22%) positive; 62 cases (68%) negative; eight cases (9%) insufficient for diagnosis; and one case (1%) equivocal. Of the 20 positive cases, follow-up biopsies were performed on 11 cases, of which six were positive and five were negative for amyloid by CR. Of the 62 negative cases, follow-up biopsies were performed on 19 cases, 14 of which were negative and five positive for amyloid by CR. A follow-up biopsy on the single equivocal case was positive for amyloid by CR. Twenty-one patients positive for amyloid, based on initial or follow-up biopsies, were managed symptomatically without any specific treatment for amyloidosis. One patient, who was specifically treated for amyloidosis by melphalan and dexamethasone, died 1 wk after therapy. Three patients with multiple myeloma and amyloidosis underwent chemotherapy. We conclude that primary clinical indications for FNAFP for amyloidosis are highly variable. An FNAFP result is often not considered clinically conclusive and is followed by further invasive procedures to detect amyloid (55% of our positive and 31% of our negative FNAFP cases were rebiopsied). The estimated sensitivity and specificity of FNAFP were 75% and 92%, respectively. Overall, the reliance on the results of FNAFP depended on the degree of clinical suspicion of the treating physician. Although in the majority of cases diagnosis of amyloidosis did not alter the treatment strategies, a conclusive positive result helped in ruling out other underlying conditions as the cause of patients' symptoms.",

        "Published":null,
        "Abstract":"There are many different glomerular disorders, including glomerulonephritis, diabetic nephropathy, and hypertensive nephrosclerosis. However, once glomerular damage reaches a certain threshold, the progression of renal disease is consistent and irreversible. Recent studies emphasized the crucial role of tubulointerstitial injury as a mediator of progression of kidney disease. One common mechanism that leads to renal failure via tubulointerstitial injury is massive proteinuria. Accumulating evidence suggests critical effects of filtered macromolecules on tubular cells, including lysosomal rupture, energy depletion, and tubular injury directly induced by specific components such as complement components. Another common mechanism is chronic hypoxia in the tubulointerstitium. Tubulointerstitial damage results in the loss of peritubular capillaries, impairing blood flow delivery. Interstitial fibrosis also impairs oxygen diffusion and supply to tubular cells. This induces chronic hypoxia in this compartment, rendering a vicious cycle. Development of novel therapeutic approaches against these final common pathways will enable us to target any types of renal disease.",

PATIENTS \/ METHOD: Eighty-five patients with suspicion of chronic liver diseases and presenting contraindications for percutaneous liver biopsy (coagulopathy, massive ascites, morbid obesity, or chronic renal problems) were submitted to 89 transjugular liver biopsies between March 1994 and April 2001 at \"Hospital São José, Irmandade da Santa Casa de Misercórdia\", Porto Alegre, RS, Brazil. Thirty-five patients underwent 36 biopsies with an automated trucut needle, and 50 patients underwent 53 biopsies with a modified Ross needle.\nRESULTS: Histological diagnosis was reached in 32\/35 subjects submitted to transjugular liver biopsy with the trucut needle (91%) and in 35\/50 (70%) submitted to biopsy with the modified Ross needle.

        "Abstract":"BACKGROUND: Tacrolimus is an effective organ transplantation immunosuppressant. Hemolytic uremic syndrome (HUS) is a rare but severe complication of tacrolimus.\nMETHODS: We report a case of tacrolimus-associated HUS and review the 15 previously reported cases.\nRESULTS: The results of the 16 cases indicated that tacrolimus-associated HUS is more frequent in females (56.3%), with the mean age at onset of 41.3 years. Forty-four percent of cases received renal transplantations. The average time from the first tacrolimus dose to HUS onset was 7.1 months. Prevalence was between 0.14.7%. The tacrolimus trough level did not predict the prognosis. Seven patients (43.7%) had improved graft function after treatment, including anticoagulation and antiplatelet therapy, reduction or discontinuation of tacrolimus, switch to cyclosporine (CyA), plasma exchange (PE) and dialysis. Five patients (31.3%) died and four patients (25%) lost their graft in spite of the above treatment. Mortality risk factors for transplant recipients with tacrolimus-associated HUS included: (1) non-renal transplant recipients (100% vs. 36.4%, p = 0.034); (2) lower peak serum Cr (2.58 +\/- 1.23 vs. 6.16 +\/- 1.96, p < 0.002); (3) liver dysfunction (60% vs. 0, p < 0.02); (4) higher serum lactate dehydrogenase (LDH) level (3119 +\/- 1019 vs. 982 +\/- 522, p < 0.001). A lower platelet count carried borderline mortality risk (29500 +\/- 14480 vs. 59625 +\/- 25584, p = 0.057).\nCONCLUSIONS: HUS should be included in the differential diagnosis of renal function deterioration in patients on tacrolimus post-organ transplantation. Frequent renal function monitoring and appropriate treatment should be performed aggressively to decrease morbidity and mortality, especially in patients with risk factors.",

        "Abstract":"Percutaneous renal biopsy (PRB) is a safe and effective tool in the diagnosis and management of renal disease; however, the optimal timing of observation after biopsy is not clearly established. With the use of real-time ultrasound guidance, PRB of native kidneys was performed in 750 adult patients at an academic institution by an attending nephrologist or fellow between June 1983 and June 2002. All patients were observed for 23 to 24 h after biopsy for the presence, severity, and timing of complications. Biopsy-related complications occurred in 98 (13%) patients; minor complications occurred in 50 (6.6%) patients, and major complications occurred in 48 (6.4%) patients. One (0.1%) patient died as a result of the biopsy. Multivariate analysis using logistic regression found only serum creatinine at baseline predictive of a complication. Patients with a serum creatinine > or = 5.0 mg\/dl were 2.3 times as likely to have a complication (odds ratio, 2.3; 95% confidence interval, 1.3 to 4.1; P < 0.005). Complications were identified in 38 (42%) patients by < or = 4 h, in 61 (67%) patients by < or = 8 h, in 77 (85%) patients by < or = 12 h, and in 81 (89%) patients at < or = 24 h. The PRB remains a safe procedure, but the risk of complication is higher in patients with advanced renal insufficiency. After biopsy, an observation time of up to 24 h remains optimal as an observation period of < or = 8 h risks missing > or = 33% of complications.",

        "Abstract":"Idiopathic (primary) tubulointerstitial nephritis (TIN) of childhood is relatively rare. Four children, two with concomitant uveitis, aged 8-14 years, with idiopathic TIN who underwent repeat renal biopsy were retrospectively evaluated. At presentation, all had a significant elevation of the urinary beta(2)-microglobulin\/creatinine ratio (beta2MG ratio), ranging from 10100 to 44550, with increased histological indices of tubulointerstitial scores (TI scores) in excess of 6 points. Three of the children received prednisolone (PSL) therapy following diagnosis, while the remaining child received the therapy 30 months after the first renal biopsy. In the children that received prompt PSL therapy, a rapid decrease in urinary beta2MG ratio was observed and the TI scores obtained at a mean interval of 16 months after the first biopsy decreased to less than 5, while preserving renal function. In the remaining child that received delayed PSL therapy, persistent elevations of urinary beta2MG ratio and TI scores were observed. He subsequently progressed to chronic renal insufficiency. These clinical findings suggest that persistent elevations of urinary beta2MG ratio and TI scores are indicators of progression of renal failure in TIN. For successful treatment, early therapeutic intervention should be deployed in selected patients with severe idiopathic TIN.",

        "Published":null,
        "Abstract":"This series of articles on the management of glomerulonephritis (GN) has been prepared by a team of experts in the evidence-based format consistent with peer review of published data. Each author was asked to review the literature for his assigned histological type, with emphasis on therapy and limited to adult studies. The age limit was not considered for minimal change disease and focal segmental glomerulosclerosis, because of the high prevalence of these glomerulopathies in children. The particular treatment recommendations for each type of glomerular disease were graded by each author according to the amount of evidence provided in these reviewed studies. The first two articles concentrate on indications and techniques for kidney biopsy. Each subsequent article focuses on and describes the highest level of evidence supporting the recommendation for therapy in IgA nephropathy (Ig-GN), minimal change nephropathy (MCN) and focal segmental glomerulosclerosis (FSGS), membranous glomerulonephritis (MGN), lupus nephritis, ANCA-associated vasculitis, HCV-associated cryoglobulinaemia and renal involvement in paraproteinemic disorders. The article on IgA nephropathy emphasises the importance of carefully evaluating both clinical and histologic findings before settling on the treatment. The recent, renewed interest in steroids and many immunosuppressive agents is discussed in detail. Recommendations related to the patient's age are also provided. MCN and FSGS are treated together because these forms share similar evidence-based recommendations. For both of these diseases, in fact, the initial treatment approach in children should be prednisone or prednisolone for four to six weeks. The therapeutic response in adults is slower than in children, but adults experience fewer relapses and a more prolonged remission. There is also a discussion on treatment of relapse, frequent relapsing disease and true steroid-resistant disease as well as the role of new immunosuppressive agents. Membranous nephropathy is a frequent cause of nephrotic syndrome in adults and, in one third of these patients, leads to end-stage renal disease. However, the treatment of this form is as yet a matter of discussion. Based on extensive critical review of the literature, the following recommendations are put forward: (a) no treatment in the absence of nephrotic syndrome; (b) patients with heavy proteinuria should receive a 6-month treatment with i.v. methylprednisolone (MP) pulse therapy for three consecutive days followed by oral MP (0.4 mg\/kg\/day) (months 1, 3, 5) and chlorambucil or cyclophosphamide (months 2, 4, 6); (c) the dosage of chlorambucil or cyclophosphamide should be lowered in older patients; (d) cyclosporine is a second-choice treatment. The treatment of lupus nephritis depends on the histologic class. No specific treatment is usually necessary for class I and IIA. Oral steroids are indicated in patients with class IIb, proteinuria and active systemic disease. Steroids and azathioprine are the treatment of choice for patients with class III and IV, but cyclosporine can be an effective alternative therapy. Cyclophosphamide is more effective than azathioprine when severe acute renal involvement is present. The treatment of ANCA-associated vasculitis depends mainly on clinical presentation, oral prednisone + oral or i.v. cyclophosphamide are generally effective. In the most severe cases, the association of MP pulse therapy with cyclophosphamide is probably more effective. Plasma exchange is probably justified in unresponsive patients. Azathioprine should replace cyclophosphamide during the maintenance therapy. In HCV-associated mixed cryoglobulinemia the treatment also depends on the severity of renal involvement. The treatment for chronic HCV infection involves alpha interferon alone or preferably in combination with ribavirin. Aggressive therapy, including i.v. MP, plasmapheresis and cyclophosphamide is primarily reserved for patients with acute severe disease, as manifested by progressive renal failure, distal necroses requiring amputation, or advanced neuropathy. Uncontrolled studies suggest that this regimen can improve renal function. Renal involvement is a common problem in paraproteinemic disorders that include multiple myeloma, Waldentrom's macroglobulinaemia and monoclonal gammopathy. The most common renal diseases in this setting are cast nephropathy, primary amyloidosis cast nephropathy, primary amyloidosis, and light chain deposition disease that are related to the overproduction of monoclonal immunoglobulin light chains. The approach to therapy varies with the cause of the renal dysfunction. Patients with amyloidosis or light-chain deposition disease are generally treated with chemotherapy, but the most effective therapy for myeloma kidney is prevention by minimising the risk factors that promote light chain filtration and subsequent obstruction by cast formation within the tubules. Chemotherapy or stem cell or bone marrow transplantation to decrease filtered light chain load, prevent volume depletion and maintain high fluid intake to reduce light chain concentration within the tubular lumen are indicated in almost all the patients.",

We present a patient with repeated rectal bleeding caused by a circumferential atone ulcer in the immediate posttransplantation period due to the use of a rectal canula after 27 years of treatment with hemodialysis. Histopathological examination of the rectal ulcer biopsy specimens revealed positive Congo red stain and additional immunohistochemical investigation showed the presence of beta 2-microglobulin in a blood vessel wall of the rectum.

        "Abstract":"PURPOSE OF REVIEW: Nephrogenic fibrosing dermopathy (NFD) is a newly recognized scleroderma-like fibrosing skin condition. It develops in patients with renal insufficiency. This review summarizes recent case reports and examines theories of disease pathogenesis. Information from the Yale University NFD Registry Project, as well as published case reports, is included to provide a contextual framework upon which to base these theories.\nRECENT FINDINGS: Recent studies have contributed to a clearer definition of the clinical spectrum, epidemiology, and pathogenesis of NFD. The findings of yellow scleral plaques and circulating antiphospholipid antibodies have been proposed as markers of NFD in recent case reports. In addition, epidemiologic data have yielded several distinct clinical patterns of disease onset. Lastly, dual immunohistochemical staining for CD34 and procollagen in the spindle cells of NFD suggest that the dermal cells of NFD may represent circulating fibrocytes recruited to the dermis-a finding previously undescribed in normal skin.\nSUMMARY: Scenario classification of NFD is a means for simplifying the search for multifactorial disease triggers, and may be helpful in predicting prognosis and response to therapy. The technique of dual immunolabeling, although not yet fully characterized as a diagnostic test, may provide a sensitive and specific method of diagnosis, as well as a starting point in the investigation of other cutaneous fibrosing disorders. The postulate that NFD may represent a systemic disorder mediated by aberrantly functioning circulating fibroblast precursor fibrocytes is explored.",

        "Published":"2003-09-16",
        "Abstract":"Henoch-Schönlein purpura (HSP) is a form of systemic vasculitis characterized by vascular wall deposits of predominantly IgA, typically involving small vessels in skin, gut, and glomeruli and associated with purpura, intestinal colic, hematuria, and arthralgia or arthritis. HSP nephritis leads to chronic renal failure in up to 20% of pediatric patients after 20 years of follow-up in selected series. The risk is related to the initial clinical presentation and is maximal (more than 50%) when initial signs are a combination of nephrotic and nephritic syndromes. Although less important, the risk persists for mild renal symptoms or when the patient has apparently completely recovered from the renal disease. Other types of non-IgA-related leukocytoclastic vasculitis may be difficult to discriminate from HSP, thus confounding the diagnosis. The clinical picture of HSP is often incomplete and renal signs can become manifest years after initial signs. When based on clinical signs only, the diagnosis of HSP can therefore be missed, and some patients risk developing silent chronic renal failure after decades without appropriate treatment. Patients can also be overdiagnosed as HSP and thus submitted to unnecessary follow-up. It is therefore important that HSP should be correctly diagnosed from the initial signs. As the finding of IgA deposits in vessel walls associated with the characteristic signs of small-vessel vasculitis is a sine qua non in the diagnosis, a skin biopsy should be performed for histological and immunofluorescence studies in cases of clinical suspicion of HSP. The systematic diagnostic use of a cutaneous biopsy should not only improve the follow-up of patients with HSP but will also allow a reliable epidemiological study of vasculitis in children and a better knowledge of the disease.",

        "Abstract":"BACKGROUND: All previous histological studies of skeletal muscles of patients with renal failure have used locomotor muscle biopsies. It is thus unclear to what degree the observed abnormalities are due to the uraemic state and how much is due to disuse. The present study was undertaken to attempt to investigate this question by examining a non-locomotor muscle (rectus abdominis) in patients with end-stage renal failure.\nMETHODS: Biopsies from rectus abdominis were obtained from 22 renal failure patients (RFPs) undergoing surgical Tenchkoff catheter implantation for peritoneal dialysis and 20 control subjects undergoing elective abdominal surgery. Histochemical staining of frozen sections and morphometric analysis was used to estimate the proportion of each fibre type, muscle fibre area and capillary density. Myosin heavy chain composition was examined by SDS-PAGE.\nRESULTS: There were no differences in fibre type distribution between RFPs and controls. All RFPs showed fibre atrophy [mean cross-sectional area (CSA) 3300 +\/- 1100 microm2, compared to 4100 +\/- 1100 microm2 in controls (P < 0.05)]. All fibre types were smaller in mean CSA in RFPs than in controls (15, 26 and 28% for types I, IIa and IIx, respectively). These differences could not be accounted for by differences in age, gender or cardiovascular or diabetic comorbidity. Muscle fibre capillarization, expressed as capillaries per fibre or capillary contacts per fibre, was significantly less in RFPs.\nCONCLUSIONS: Since a non-locomotor muscle was examined, the effects of disuse as a cause of atrophy have been minimized. It is likely, therefore, that the decreased muscle fibre CSA and capillary density of RFPs compared to controls were due predominantly to uraemia itself.",

        "Abstract":"UNLABELLED: Eighteen patients (12 female) with Wegener's granulomatosis (WG) treated from 1982-2001 were studied. Mean duration of patients' symptoms prior to diagnosis was 13.5 months, and mean age 41.2. Lung biopsy confirmed WG in 5 patients, nasal biopsy was made in 12, endobronchial in 3. In 11 of 14 patients cANCAs were found. Prednisone and 2 mg\/kg\/day doses of oral cyclophosphamide were used to treat 17 patients, prednisone was used alone for 1. Patients with severe symptoms were given i.v. 'pulse' methylprednisolone. Mean duration of treatment was 34.8 months and of follow-up, 71.9 months. A total of 4 patients died: 3 from complete renal failure. Four patients still undergo treatment, improving markedly. Complete remission was achieved in 6 patients. A total of 3 patients relapsed and are recently treated. In another one chronic renal failure developed. Three of them had moderate symptoms at diagnosis but were treated inadequately.\nIN CONCLUSION: manifestation of WG and severity of symptoms may be different among patients. ANCA is not universally present in all patients with WG. The absence of ANCA does not exclude WG diagnosis. Complete remission can be achieved in WG patients, including the severely ill, if adequate therapy is given. Moderate symptoms at presentation do not justify less intensive treatment.",

Most examples are of B cell origin, and CD30+ T cell PTLD are very rare. We report a CD30+ anaplastic large cell lymphoma (ALCL) in the skin of the right lower leg and in draining lymph nodes of the right inguinal region in an immunosuppressed 59-year-old male who had received a renal graft 9 years previously. Unlike the vast majority of PTLD, an incomplete T cell immunophenotype was observed, and there was evidence of T cell lineage at the genetic level reflected by a rearranged T cell receptor gamma gene. The neoplastic cells were non-reactive to the anaplastic lymphoma kinase (ALK) 1 protein. In addition, Epstein-Barr virus and human herpesvirus 8 sequences were absent. Arguments against a primary cutaneous ALCL, which is also ALK-1 negative, include systemic presentation at the time of initial diagnosis and immunoreactivity of the neoplastic cells to epithelial membrane antigen. Typically, our rare example of a posttransplantation systemic ALCL showed an aggressive behaviour and a poor response to both chemotherapy and local irradiation.",

        "Abstract":"BACKGROUND: Patients with end-stage renal disease are at high risk for hepatitis B (HBV) or hepatitis C virus (HCV) infection. Because therapy indication for viral hepatitis depends on virologic, biochemical, and histologic criteria, liver biopsy usually is necessary. Recently, a panel of serum fibrosis markers has been postulated to allow quantification of liver fibrosis by noninvasive means.\nMETHODS: A cross-sectional study of all hepatitis B surface antigen (HBsAg)- and anti-HCV-positive renal allograft recipients among 900 renal allograft recipients regularly controlled in the authors' outpatient nephrology service was performed. The correlation between histologic, biochemical, and virologic parameters was assessed with an emphasis on the fibrosis marker hyaluronate in this immunosuppressed population.\nRESULTS: Twenty-two HBsAg- and 62 anti-HCV-positive patients were analyzed. Based on polymerase chain reaction results, 86% of anti-HCV-positive and 95% of HBsAg-positive patients had actively replicating infection. In 41 of 67 (61%) patients with replicating disease, liver biopsy was performed, and the association of various biochemical parameters with the histologic scores for necroinflammation and fibrosis was investigated. Less than 10% of these patients had advanced fibrosis, although the mean time of infection was more than 15 years. We found no correlation of any of the serum parameters (including hyaluronate) with histologic activity of liver disease except for the peak glutamate-oxalacetate transaminase value recorded during the entire posttransplant period.\nCONCLUSION: Liver biopsy remains the gold standard for evaluation of liver disease and therapy decision in immunosuppressed renal allograft recipients.",

Age, gender, 24 h proteinuria, serum creatinine level, blood pressure and ANCA were evaluated. The end-point for renal survival analysis was the start of chronic dialysis.\nRESULTS: Twenty-six (70%) patients showed varying degrees of renal insufficiency, nine (24%) patients required dialysis, 13 (35%) were hypertensive (BP > or =140\/90 mmHg) and 33 (89%) had proteinuria.

The purpose of this study was to examine the impact of CMV infection on histopathologic changes in 6-month protocol biopsy specimens of kidney allografts.\nMETHODS: Altogether, 52 renal allograft recipients were studied. CMV infection was diagnosed by CMV antigenemia test, viral cultures from blood and urine, or both. CMV was demonstrated in the biopsy specimens by antigen detection and hybridization in situ. Acute rejections were diagnosed by biopsy histology, and biopsy specimens were graded according to the Banff '97 classification.\nRESULTS: CMV infection was diagnosed in 41 patients. The 11 patients in whom CMV infection was not detected were used as controls. Acute rejection was diagnosed in 22 of 41 CMV patients and in 6 of 11 control patients. CMV was demonstrated in the biopsy specimens of 19 of 41 CMV patients. CMV was not associated with increased glomerular, tubular, or interstitial changes. However, the arteriosclerotic changes in small arterioles were significantly increased in the subgroup of patients where CMV was demonstrated in the graft as compared with controls (P<0.01). Analysis of the impact of acute rejection on arteriolar thickening showed that only a positive history of both acute rejection and CMV found in the graft was associated with significantly increased vascular changes compared with CMV-free recipients (P<0.05).\nCONCLUSIONS: Neither CMV nor acute rejection alone was associated with increased vascular or other histopathologic changes in 6-month protocol biopsy specimens of kidney allografts, but a previous history of both acute rejection and the presence of CMV in the graft was associated with increased vascular changes.",

        "Abstract":"Anderson-Fabry disease (AFd) is a rare X-linked lisosomal storage disorder of glycosphingolipid (GL) metabolism, caused by a deficiency of the activity of alpha-galactosidase A (alpha-gal A). The progressive accumulation of GL in tissues results in the clinical manifestations of the disease, that are more evident in hemizygous males, and include characteristic skin lesions (angiokeratomas), neurological symptoms (acroparesthesia), ocular features (cornea verticillata), cardiac involvement (left ventricular enlargement, conduction abnormalities), cerebrovascular manifestations (thromboses, hemorrhage, etc.), and kidney involvement with progression to end-stage renal failure (ESRF). ESRF is a common manifestation in hemizygous males (3rd-5th decade) and death occurs around the 5th decade of life because of severe cardiac and\/or cerebrovascular complications. Heterozygous females have an attenuated form of this systemic disease. In the kidney, accumulation of GL occurs in the endothelial cells of every vessel, in the epithelial cells of every tubular segment, and in all kinds of glomerular cells. The broad spectrum of renal lesions is a pathophysiological continuum with progressive impairment in the renal function related to continuous intracellular deposition of GL. Electron microscopic study of renal biopsies shows typical osmiophilic inclusion bodies in the cytoplasm of all kind of renal cells, characterized by concentric lamellation of clear and dark layers (35-50 A of periodicity). ESRF is treated by dialysis and kidney transplantation: neither treatment modifies the progression of the cardiovascular and cerebrovascular lesions due to progressive GL deposition. The outcome of kidney transplantation seems to be similar to that found in other non-diabetic patients, but the survival rate on dialysis is lower than in patients with other causes of ESRF. Nowadays, treatment with enzyme replacement infusion with purified alpha-Gal A, produced by a genetically engineered human cell line or Chinese hamster ovocytes, seems to be effective and safe.",

The clinical manifestations, serologic results and prognosis were compared for Classes Va and Vb.\nRESULTS: The incidence of hypertension and anemia in Class Vb patients was significantly higher than in Class Va (38.5% vs 21.3%, 72.5% vs 52.5%, p<0.05). The incidence of hematuria and renal insufficiency in Class Vb was 64.8%and 15.4%, which was higher than Class Va (44.2% and 3.3%), but lower than Class IV (89.1% and 35%), p<0.05.

We describe here two renal transplant patients with cholesterol embolization in their allograft biopsies. The first, a 48-year-old patient, received a renal transplant from a 62-year-old donor with a history of hypertension and tobacco use. On account of initial non-function, a renal biopsy was taken, which showed acute tubular necrosis and cholesterol emboli. The second, a 55-year-old man, presented chronic allograft failure six years after transplantation; ultrasonography showed a solid renal mass. Nephrectomy specimens revealed renal carcinoma and a combination of chronic rejection and multiple cholesterol emboli. Cholesterol embolic disease is probably an under-reported cause of renal graft dysfunction. The source of the emboli may be either the donor or the recipient's vessels. Since the current tendency is to accept older donors and recipients with more advanced atherosclerotic disease, this condition is likely to become more frequent in the future. Particular care must be taken at the time of organ procurement and during the evaluation of organ donors, in order to reduce the risk of embolization.",

The extent of intimal hyperplasia depends on the interplay between cyclins and cyclin-dependent kinases (e.g. cdk2), positively regulating cell-cycle progression. cdk activity is negatively modulated by the interaction with cdk inhibitory proteins, such as p21(Waf1) and p27(Kip1). Little is known about the expression of these proteins in the development of intimal hyperplasia in AVFs.\nMETHODS: p21(Waf1), p27(Kip1), cdk2 and Proliferating Cell Nuclear Antigen immunoreactivity was determined in 18 failed AVFs from 16 CRF patients and 10 non-diseased vessels (five arteries and five veins).\nRESULTS: The percentage of p21(Waf1)-positive cells was significantly lower in AVFs (3+\/-1%), compared with normal veins and arteries (62+\/-4 and 63+\/-4%, respectively; P<0.001). cdk2-positive cells were significantly higher in AVFs (40.7+\/-3.7%) than in normal veins and arteries (2+\/-1 and 0+\/-0%, respectively; P<0.001). Although no difference in p27(Kip1) immunoreactivity was found between AVFs (37+\/-17%) and veins (23+\/-8%; P=0.208), it was lower in healthy arteries (17+\/-11%; P=0.037).\nCONCLUSIONS: The data suggest that in failed AVFs, p21(Waf1), but not p27(Kip1), is related to intimal hyperplasia. This is the first report to show involvement of cell-cycle regulators in AVF-related human intimal hyperplasia.",

        "Abstract":"BACKGROUND: Hypertensive renal damage has become one of the most important causes of end-stage renal failure (ESRF) in Western countries. Affected patients rarely have a kidney biopsy and their diagnoses therefore remain uncertain. The objective of the present study was to examine patients suspected of renal glomerular disease, which at biopsy proved to have isolated benign nephrosclerosis. We wanted to study the effect of different clinical and laboratory variables at the time of biopsy on the short-term and long-term progression to ESRF and death.\nMETHODS: We retrospectively examined 102 patients who were diagnosed by kidney biopsy in Norway between April 1988 and December 1990. All patients were followed by means of registries for approximately 13 years to describe renal and patient survival.\nRESULTS: The age of the patients at the time of biopsy was 55+\/-15 years (range 15-88 years). Three years after the time of biopsy, 18% had developed ESRF and 24% had died; the corresponding numbers 13 years after biopsy were 32% and 47%. By Kaplan-Meier analyses, the following variables indicated short-term progression to ESRF: serum creatinine > or = 200 micro mol\/l, systolic blood pressure > or = 160 mmHg and proteinuria > or = 1 g\/24 h. In addition, patients with increased diastolic blood pressure, increased age and decreased serum albumin tended to develop ESRF more often. Long-term predictors of ESRF in Kaplan-Meier analyses were increased serum creatinine and urinary protein. Independent risk factors for progression to ESRF were increased serum creatinine and increased urinary protein. Independent risk factors for death were increased age and increased serum creatinine.\nCONCLUSIONS: Benign nephrosclerosis is a common condition that is associated with a high morbidity and mortality. Short-term predictors of ESRF differ from long-term predictors and this may reflect a pathophysiologically meaningful difference.",

The most predictive parameters for development of renal failure are: type of hystological changes, degree of interstitial inflammation, serum creatinine concentration at the time of diagnosis and therapeutical protocols used in the treatment. Single center experience in a group of 220 lupus patients is presented in this paper. In 130 patients (59%) lupus nephritis was diagnosed by clinical and laboratory tests, while 74 kidney biopsies were performed. Proliferative type of lupus nephritis (class IV in 54% of cases and class III in 18.9%) was more frequent than the other histological types. During a long term follow up (range 1-17 years, mean 7.6 years) renal failure developed in 17 patients (24%), while 11% of patients developed uremia and required dialysis. Development of renal failure was influenced by histological changes with predominance of class IV lupus nephropathy, disseminated disease with more ARA criteria for systemic lupus erythematosus classification present at the time of kidney biopsy, more frequent lupus flares, persistence of low complement levels during the first year of follow-up and even earlier.",

Immunosuppressive therapy was reduced once a diagnosis of KS was made. A nested polymerase chain reaction was used to detect human herpesvirus 8 (HHV-8) DNA in the biopsy tissue. The DNA was extracted from fresh tissue (n = 2) or from formalin-fixed, paraffin-embedded specimens (n = 5).\nRESULTS: Six cases of KS were diagnosed. All patients with cutaneous KS improved with a reduction in immunosuppressive drugs. HHV-8 was detected in 100% (2\/2) of the frozen biopsies and 20% (1\/5) of the formalin-fixed samples investigated.\nCONCLUSIONS: Our experience indicates that a continuous state of immunodeficiency is important for the development of KS in RTRs.

Among the latter, the importance of the mass of the donor kidney is an issue of interest. We hypothesized that glomerular hypertrophy is a risk factor for deterioration of allograft function. The goal of this study was to examine the role of glomerular size in predicting late allograft dysfunction.\nMETHODS: All baseline graft biopsies between 1990 and 1998 were reviewed and sections containing at least 15 glomeruli were selected for morphometric analyses. Glomerular size was measured using the maximal profile area (MPA) method. Linear correlations between creatinine clearance (Ccr) and variables were evaluated. Covariates that tended to correlate with Ccr on univariate analysis (p < 0.2) were examined using multivariate analysis to determine the covariates associated with Ccr at 6 months (M) and 1, 2, 3, 4 years (yrs) after transplantation.\nRESULTS: Eighty-six patients were enrolled. Donor age, MPA, baseline Ccr, percent of global glomerulosclerosis (GS%), cyclosporin nephrotoxicity, cold ischemic time(CIT) and episodes of rejection were significantly correlated with interval Ccr in univariate analyses. MPA was a significant covariate at 6M, 1 yr, 3 yrs and 4 yrs. Other covariates significantly associated with interval Ccr included GS%, baseline Ccr, CIT and number of acute rejection episodes.\nCONCLUSIONS: Glomerular size in baseline biopsies is predictive of late allograft function, and the presence of hypertrophied glomeruli combined with other factors contributes to chronic renal allograft dysfunction.",

Glomerular volumes (GV) were measured using the maximal profile area (MPA) method. The frequency of glomeruli with totally sclerotic lesions representing degree of global GS was expressed as a percentage of total number of glomeruli counted.\nRESULTS: 102 donor specimens (M\/F, 46\/56; mean age, 37.4 +\/- 17.3 yrs) were analyzed showing mean MPA of 27.8 +\/- 6.6 (x 10(-3)mm2), mean GV of 3.6 +\/- 1.2 (x 10(6)microm3) and mean GS% of 6 +\/- 10%. GV was increased with increasing age (r2 = 0.32, p < 0.0001). There was a progressive increase in glomerular size between infancy and adolescence (2-18 years old). The rate of MPA growth over childhood appeared to be linear (n = 13, r2 = 0.66, p = 0.0004). However, MPA increased with age at a slower rate (n = 99, r2 = 0.66, p = 0.0004) in adults (excluding data for patients < 18 years) than in infancy and adolescence. There wasn't significant gender difference in GV. Age (r = 0.47, p < 0.0001) and MPA (r = 0.31, p < 0.05) were both positively correlated with global GS.\nCONCLUSIONS: 1.

        "Abstract":"BACKGROUND: Loss of lean body mass is frequently reported in patients with end-stage renal disease (ES-RD). Inadequate nutrient intake, superimposed illnesses, endocrine disorders, uremia and acidosis are some of the potential causes of muscle depletion. Previous reports on experimental models show that lean body mass depletion results from enhancement of muscle tissue protein catabolism, mainly associated with activation of ATP-ubiquitin-dependent proteolysis. Little is known, however, about the affects on this proteolytic system in ESRD patients on maintenance hemodialysis (HD). The present study was designed to investigate the expression of ubiquitin mRNAs in skeletal muscle of patients with ESRD on maintenance HD.\nMETHODS: Biopsies from the rectus abdominis muscle were obtained from eight ESRD patients and from six control subjects undergoing surgery for benign disease. Ubiquitin mRNA levels were measured by Northern blotting analysis.\nRESULTS: Patients with ESRD had mild metabolic acidosis, as a result of chronic intermittent HD. There were no significant differences between HD patients and controls with regard to the 1.2kb polyubiquitin mRNA species (332.9+\/-139 vs 324.2+\/-60; ns), but the levels of the 2.4 kb mRNA species were significantly lower in HD patients than in controls (1687+\/-542 vs 2529.9+\/-325, p=0.01). No correlation was observed between ubiquitin mRNA levels and nutritional parameters and degree of acidosis.\nCONCLUSIONS: The present study found that the ubiquitin mRNA levels were not increased in the muscle of stable, mildly acidotic hemodialysis patients.",

        "Abstract":"BACKGROUND: Measurement of the serum concentration of the secretory products of the gastric mucosa, pepsinogen A (PgA), pepsinogen C (PgC) and gastrin is called the serological gastric biopsy. Additional measurement of Helicobacter pylori antibodies and antibodies to parietal cells and intrinsic factor supports the non-invasive diagnostic value of the serum markers. In many clinical studies, the diagnostic potential of the serum markers in predicting the topography and severity of gastric mucosal disorders has been established. The aim was to assess the diagnostic value of the serological gastric biopsy for primary care.\nMETHOD: Survey of the literature.\nRESULTS: The cell-physiological background of the serological gastric biopsy, the interpretation of the outcome of serum markers and the relation of these parameters to various gastric mucosal disorders are described. Measurement of PgA is a reliable way to discriminate between mucosal gastritis and functional dyspepsia. PgA is raised in duodenal, gastric and pyloric ulcer even though gastrin is normal. Both PgA and gastrin are raised in renal insufficiency and the Zollinger-Ellison syndrome. A low PgA is indicative of mucosal atrophy and a good indicator for gastric hypoacidity. An additional low PgA:C ratio is indicative of atrophic gastritis or extensive intestinal metaplasia of the stomach. A hypopepsinogenaemia can also be an alarm symptom for gastric cancer. A low PgA and a high gastrin is indicative of corpus atrophy.\nCONCLUSION: In primary care, the serological gastric biopsy might be a feasible and appropriate diagnostic method for management of the dyspeptic patient. Further research in general practice has to be done to validate the predictive value of the serological gastric biopsy and to define a diagnostic strategy.",

        "Abstract":"The Authors report 3 cases with clinical renal manifestations where the indication to perform a renal biopsy was defined as borderline. The uncertain indication was related to the clinical presentation, with a pattern of urinary abnormalities, such as isolated microscopic hematuria, microscopic hematuria associated with mild proteinuria, and isolated proteinuria. In addition, similar questions on biopsy are raised for chronic renal failure and elderly patients. In the literature, microscopic hematuria without significant proteinuria shows that 25% of adult patients have no histological abnormalities. A higher percentage is found among children. The other cases exhibit a pattern of IgA nephropathy, Alport's syndrome, thin BM nephropathy and arteriolar C3 deposition. The percentage of an abnormal histological picture increases if the patients have a family history of hematuria, and if there are concomitant episodes of macroscopic hematuria, because of an increase in IgA nephropathy and Alport's syndrome, respectively. In the last cases, therefore the indication to perform a renal biopsy increases. For those patients without these characteristics, a renal biopsy can be delayed whereas in cases of microscopic hematuria with proteinuria or isolated proteinuria the indication for a renal biopsy is stronger, because the spectrum of glomerulopathies is wider, and the possible evolution to renal failure after 10 years is higher (10-14% of cases). In patients with chronic renal failure the biopsy is contraindicated for cases where the thickness of the cortical section of the kidney is lower than 8-10 mm, because of possible technical difficulties, lower diagnostic information due to sclerosis and higher risk of complications. The prolonged bleeding time and the consequent risk of bleeding can be avoided by i.v. infusion of vasopressin 2 hours prior to biopsy. The higher indications are for those patients who may be susceptible to a medical treatment, capable to slowing down the progression of nephropathy. Finally, in elderly patients the biopsy is indicated in almost all cases because of the recently confirmed high incidence of glomerulopathies. In the aged there is a higher frequency of membranous GN, crescentic-ANCA associated GN, amyloidosis and, according to some Authors, post-infectious GN. In all cases a precise histological diagnosis can correct an erroneous diagnosis made according to clinical data alone. In the elderly the indication for biopsy aims at making an exact diagnosis of nephropathy, especially for acute renal failure: for this purpose age itself should not become an obstacle.",

Patients with advanced hepatitis C often are excluded from renal transplantation.\nSTUDY: Forty-six renal transplant candidates and 46 control subjects matched for age, sex, and race without renal disease were included. Demographic, laboratory, and histologic data were compared between patients with ESRD and control subjects.\nRESULTS: Alanine aminotransferase levels were significantly lower in patients with ESRD (p < 0.001).

Patients with ESRD had less inflammatory activity (p < 0.001) and a lower proportion of bridging fibrosis or cirrhosis (13%) than control subjects (30%, p = 0.043). Clinical and laboratory features did not predict histologic grade or stage of hepatitis C in patients with ESRD. Two complications of percutaneous liver biopsy occurred per three diagnoses of cirrhosis in patients with ESRD.

She was diagnosed with group A beta-haemolytic streptococcus (Streptococcus pyogenes) necrotizing fasciitis and streptococcal toxic shock syndrome. The patient had a past history of psoriasis and end-stage renal impairment. Despite treatment with multiple antibiotics in an intensive care unit, the skin infarction involving the upper trunk continued to expand and the patient died within 24 hours of hospital admission. Group A streptococcus and Staphylococcus aureus were cultured from a tissue biopsy. Renal failure and compromised skin barrier function are known to predispose to invasive streptococcal infections, but necrotizing fasciitis has only rarely been reported in association with psoriasis. This case illustrates the fulminant nature of the infection.",

        "Abstract":"The current recommendations of kidney biopsy in childhood idiopathic nephrotic syndrome (CINS) were put forward to minimize unnecessary kidney biopsies in underlying minimal change disease (MCD). However, there remains a diversity of opinion about the criteria for biopsying children with idiopathic nephrotic syndrome. This study was conducted to prospectively study their usefulness in avoiding biopsies in MCD and to evaluate further modifications for minimizing biopsies in CINS. Of 400 consecutive CINS patients, 222 patients were subjected to kidney biopsy according to the current recommendations. The histopathology spectrum of these selectively biopsied children revealed focal segmental glomerulosclerosis (FSGS) in 39%, MCD in 34.2%, membranoproliferative glomerulonephritis (MPGN) in 16.2%, mesangioproliferative glomerulonephritis (MesPGN) in 7.6%, membranous nephropathy (MN) in 1.8%, and diffuse mesangial sclerosis (DMS) in 0.9%. We observed that despite the current recommendations and efforts to minimize biopsy, 34% of children had MCD on histopathology. Two or more clinical (hematuria and hypertension) or biochemical (renal insufficiency) parameters were present in all children with MPGN. Low C3 was present only in children with MPGN. All the steroid responders were found to have MCD, FSGS, or MesPGN on biopsy. Cyclophosphamide response correlated better with steroid responsiveness ( P=0.02) than with histo- pathology ( P=0.80) in MCD, FSGS, and MesPGN. Based on these observations, we suggest some modifications in current recommendations for kidney biopsy to minimize biopsying children with MCD. These are (1) biopsies in children (age 1-16 years) should be restricted (a) to a subgroup with two or more clinical and biochemical parameters and (b) in steroid non-responders, (2) the decision to administer cyclophosphamide should be based on steroid response pattern without requiring a prior routine biopsy.",

At presentation with idiopathic disease, older patients were more often hypertensive and had worse renal impairment than the younger cohort, but had a similar levels of proteinuria, hypoalbuminemia and hematuria. Thrombotic complications and minor rheumatological complaints were more common in the older patients. Prognosis for life and renal survival was worse in the older onset patients.

        "Abstract":"BACKGROUND: Chronic renal allograft nephropathy is characterized by an abnormal accumulation of extracellular matrix proteins in the glomeruli and tubulo-interstitium. The aim of this study was to determine the relationship between intragraft expression of the genes controlling the accumulation of extracellular matrix and the development of chronic renal allograft nephropathy in human renal transplants.\nMETHODS: Forty renal allografts with stable renal function were biopsied 6 months after transplantation. Single glomeruli were plucked from the surface of these protocol biopsies and total messenger RNA (mRNA) was extracted. Reverse transcriptase-polymerase chain reaction was used to study the intragraft expression of several fibrosis-associated genes (collagen III, collagen IValpha2, matrix metalloproteinase (MMP) 2, tissue inhibitors of metalloproteinases (TIMPs) 1 and 2, tenascin and transforming growth factor (TGF) beta1). The level of tubulo-interstitial fibrosis was measured by quantitative immunostaining of collagen III.\nRESULTS: There were positive correlations between the level of tubulo-interstitial collagen III immunostaining and intragraft expression of the genes for TIMP-1 (rs= 0.70, P < 0.02) and TIMP-2 (rs = 0.59, P < 0.02). Interstitial fibrosis was also strongly correlated with the levels of TGF-beta mRNA (rs = 0.67, P < 0.002). Finally, TIMP-1 expression increased with TGF-beta expression (rs = 0.77, P < 0.002).\nCONCLUSION: Failure of extracellular matrix degradation may be an important molecular mechanism in the pathogenesis of chronic renal allograft damage.",

        "Abstract":"OBJECTIVES: To report on a case of primary renal lymphoma (PRL) and update the literature concerning this topic.\nMATERIALS AND METHODS: A 48-year-old woman underwent surgery for the presumed diagnosis of renal cell carcinoma with bilateral adrenal metastases.\nRESULTS: The neoplasm was assessed as primary renal non-Hodgkin high grade lymphoma, diffuse large B-cell type. Then the patient underwent polychemotherapy according to the VACOP-B protocol. Unfortunately, 5 weeks later the patient was lost since missing chemotherapy and follow-up.\nCONCLUSIONS: PRL is a distinct pathological and clinical entity which is extremely rare and highly aggressive since disseminating rapidly from its origin. The disease usually affects adults with an average age of 60 years and slight male preponderance; however it has also been reported in childhood. Etiology factors for PRL are unknown. Several histogenetic theories of the disease have been postulated since the kidney does not normally contain lymphoid tissue. Investigators reported many classes of non-Hodgkin lymphoma which include large, small, intermediate and mixed cell types with high, intermediate or low grade histologies. The neoplastic lymphoid cells may express both B and T immunoblastic phenotypes, primary renal Hodgkin lymphoma has also been reported. The disease may present with progressive renal failure of either oliguric or non oliguric type. Imaging studies in diagnosing and staging primary renal lymphomas include ultrasound examination (US) and computed tomography (CT); there are also some reports of magnetic resonance imaging (MRI). Total body bone scan and bone marrow biopsy will complete disease clinical staging. Renal biopsy is important in assessing the diagnosis of PRL as well as of acute renal failure for bilateral lymphomatous infiltration of the kidneys. Up to now, there are no standard treatment modalities for this entity since the small number of cases reported. Multidrug chemotherapy is mandatory for high grade lymphoma and when the disease is diagnosed preoperatively. High dose chemotherapy in the future may offer a curative approach in primary bilateral renal disease and without end-stage renal disease. Survival is extremely poor since 75% of patients die less than 1 year after operation. Prognosis may be improved by early detection of disease and by performing systemic chemotherapy.",

        "Abstract":"Although pulse methylprednisolone therapy (PMT) has been used successfully in the management of children with steroid-resistant nephrotic syndrome (SRNS), the relationship between initial presenting findings and renal histological characteristics to the subsequent clinical response to PMT is unknown. A retrospective analysis was conducted in a study cohort of 42 children (30 boys, 12 girls; mean age, 7.4 +\/- 4.7 years) with SRNS administered PMT between June 1976 and July 1994 at Stanford University (Stanford, CA). Four diagnostic categories were created: group I, minimal change disease with or without mesangial hypercellularity (n = 10); group II, mesangial proliferation (n = 7); group III, focal segmental glomerulosclerosis (FSGS) with or without mesangial hypercellularity (n = 10); and group IV, FSGS plus mesangial proliferation (n = 15). Primary variables analyzed were remission in response to PMT with or without alkylating agent therapy and end-stage renal disease (ESRD). Remission rates were best in group I (90%) and worst in group IV (46%). With the exception of hematuria, presenting clinical features did not correlate with outcome. Segmental sclerosis, glomerular adhesion to Bowman's capsule, epithelial sloughing, corona (segmental scar surrounded by visceral epithelial cells), subepithelial deposits, inflammatory cells, and percentage of interstitium, immunoglobulin M (IgM), IgG, and C3 deposition univariately correlated with ESRD in univariate analysis. In a multivariate logistic regression model, only segmental sclerosis (P = 0.008) correlated with ESRD. Histological analysis is important because it identifies features, including segmental sclerosis, that portend a poor prognosis in children with SRNS.",

        "Abstract":"Abstract  We analyzed renal biopsy specimens from 100 patients to evaluate the characteristics of renal involvement in patients with rheumatoid arthritis (RA). Membranous nephropathy (MN) was the most common renal histological pattern (31%). Mesangial proliferative glomerulonephritis (GN) was found in 21% of cases (IgA nephropathy 12%, non-IgA GN 9%), minor changes in 17%, renal amyloidosis in 11%, interstitial nephritis in 9%, sclerotic GN in 4%, and crescentic GN in 2%. MN was relatively more frequent in men than in women, and most developed nephrotic syndrome, while a few developed renal failure. Disease-modifying antirheumatic drugs (DMARDs) correlated with MN in 26 of 31 cases. Mesangial proliferative GN showed high-grade hematuria. Amyloidosis correlated with long duration of RA; approximately half of the cases with amyloidosis also had nephrotic syndrome, and 82% developed renal failure. Of the 100 patients, 82% showed some tubulo-interstitial changes, which might be related to non-steroidal anti-inflammatory drugs. Because renal lesions in RA are very diverse, and early stage cases of MN and amyloidosis can be detected only by histological examinations, renal biopsy should be performed in cases with continuous urinary abnormalities or progressive renal failure.",

The purpose of the study was to establish the complication rate after real-time ultrasound-guided RB with a biopsy gun, the adequacy of renal tissue samples for pathohistological tests, the rate of concurrence between clinical and pathohistological diagnoses, and the benefits of the procedure. From January 1994 to October 1999, 88 renal biopsies were performed on 82 children, 81 of whom (35M, 46F, aged 3-20 y) were included in this retrospective study. The nephrotic syndrome (in infants, older children, those with evidence of nephritis or failing corticosteroid therapy) was the most frequent indication of RB. Other indications were non-nephrotic proteinuria, nephritic syndrome, glomerular haematuria, renal allograft dysfunction, unexplained acute or chronic renal failure, and kidney disease progression monitoring. No serious complications were noted. The adequacy rate of renal tissue samples ranged from 93.1 to 96.6%, depending on which definition of the adequacy of renal tissue samples was used. Clinical and pathohistological diagnoses matched in 81.4% of the cases. Data obtained by RB were very beneficial to patients in terms of establishing, confirming or altering the diagnosis and, consequently, the treatment.\nCONCLUSION: The results confirm that real-time ultrasound-guided RB with a biopsy gun is a safe procedure and provides information that is very beneficial to patients.",

Diagnosis was corrected in 21.7% (15\/69) of the cases and the method of treatment was changed in 56.5% (39\/69) cases after biopsy.\nCONCLUSION: It is showed that some cases of ARF were misdiagnosed as CRF. The size of the kidney and finger nail creatinine level would be helpful in the differentiation of CRF and ARF. The difficulty in establishing the causes of ARF is the differentiation between acute glomerulonephritis and rapidly progressive glomerulonephritis (RPGN), acute tubular necrosis (ATN) and acute interstitial nephritis (AIN). ATN or AIN with chronic glomerulonephritis may be confused with RPGN. When there is difficulty in differentiation, renal biopsy should be performed as soon as possible.",

There were 27 patients, 21 males and 6 females, aged from 19 to 51 years. At the same time, the clinical and pathological features of primary MHPT were compared with those of renal parenchymal MHPT.\nRESULTS: Among these patients, primary hypertension was diagnosed in 10 cases (37%), glomerulonephritis in 10 cases (37%), renovascular hypertension in 1 case (3.7%), and undetermined etiology in 6 cases (22.3%). The common renal presentations were those of rapidly progressive glomerulonephritis (RPGN) and progressive renal failure. Compared with those who were diagnosed as renal parenchymal MHPT, primary MHPT patients had lower urinary protein excretion (P = 0.001) and most of them had family history of hypertension. Renal biopsy was done in 13 cases, revealing primary MHPT in 4 cases and glomerulonephritis in 9. Typical pathological findings for primary MHPT were fibroid necrosis, marked intimal hyperplasia (\"onion skin\" like change) and ischemic changes of glomeruli. Severe glomerulonephritis, hyalinosis and thickening of renal arterioles were the main changes in MHPT with renal parenchymal diseases. After intensive therapy, the renal functions of some primary MHPT patients improved markedly.\nCONCLUSION: Malignant hypertension presenting with renal damage was not very rare.

        "Abstract":"FMF Amyloidosis is an important etiological factor of end stage renal disease (ESRD) in Mediterranean Countries. Apart from major target organs as cardiovascular, respiratory and gastrointestinal system, endocrine organs can also be involved. We planned to investigate the thyroid involvement in our amyloidosis group. The aim of this study was to determine clinical characteristics of amyloid goiter in FMF patients and the abnormalities of thyroid function, as well as to identify pathologic characteristics. Twenty-two hemodialysis patients (mean age 34.1 +\/- 14 years, range 17-68) whose ESRD secondary to FMF amyloidosis were evaluated with physical examination, serum levels of thyroid hormones, ultrasound examination of thyroid glands, thyroid syntigraphic studies. Goiter was found in 10 patients (4 male, 6 female) having enlarged neck mass (mean age 35 +\/- 14 years, range 23-64). The serum levels of thyroid hormones and TSH were normal in 4 patients. Other four cases had euthyroid sick syndrome. Only one patient developed tender enlarged neck mass with subacute thyroiditis symptoms and one had primary hyperthyroidism. Ultrasound examination showed; hypoecoic nodules in 6 patients diffuse multinodular enlargement in 4 patients. Thyroid syntigraphic studies revealed hypoactive nodules in 7 patients and hyperactive nodules in 3 patients. After the laboratory tests were completed, in 10 patients diagnosis were made with fine needle aspiration biopsy. Of 10 patients 5 underwent subtotal thyroidectomy. Immunohistochemical evaluation demonstrated the presence of amyloid AA immunoreactivity in all cases. In conclusion fine needle aspiration from the thyroid when enlarged is useful in the diagnosis of suspected amyloidosis, especially since it is a safe, easily performed procedure. With the help of amyloid goiter diagnosis the patient's prognosis on hemodialysis and with renal transplantation can be predicted. Amyloid goiter must be searched in hemodialysis patients especially in Mediterranean Countries.",

Five severe complications (0.5%) were observed. Operation was unavoidable in three patients. Four of the major complications were caused by bleeding. Two patients had hematological diseases, and one--chronic kidney failure waiting for kidney transplantation. One patient collapsed immediately after the liver biopsy with bile aspiration. That forced urgent operation in one hour. The possible cause of the complication and the limited theoretical potentialities of ultrasonography and laparoscopy to establish it are discussed. Aspiration of bile during liver biopsy was observed in 0.9% of cases despite the exact keeping of contraindications and technics of examination. Transhepatic puncture of the gallblader is also possible in some of those cases. The necessity to check by ultrasonography the chosen point for biopsy is also emphasized. We recommend to name that biopsy \"percutaneous\" or \"puncture\" but not \"blind\". In this way the second reason (after bleeding) for death after liver biopsy--biliary peritonitis will be reduced to the absolute minimum.",

        "Abstract":"This study was performed to investigate the correlation between clinical parameters and grading of iron deposition in renal biopsy specimens from 102 patients with various kidney diseases. Iron deposition in renal tissues was detected by Berlin blue staining. The extent of iron staining was semiquantitatively graded as negative (Fe(-)), grade 0, or positive (Fe(+)), including faint, grade 1; moderate, grade 2; or severe, grade 3, by light microscopy. Thirty-four of 102 patients (33%) showed positive iron staining. Fe(+) patients had various renal diseases, mainly consisting of 12 patients with immunoglobulin A nephropathy and 5 patients with benign nephrosclerosis. Mean arterial pressure (MAP), serum creatinine (sCr) levels, incidence of hematuria, and urinary N-acetylbeta-D-glucosaminidase (u-NAG) levels in Fe(+) patients were significantly greater than those in Fe(-) patients, and u-NAG levels correlated positively with the extent of iron deposition. Study patients were tentatively divided into two groups according to the extent of iron deposition: group A, patients with grades 2 and 3 staining, and group B, patients with grades 0 and 1 staining. In group A, MAP, sCr level, urinary protein excretion, and the incidence of hematuria were significantly greater than in group B. Our results suggest that the amount of iron deposition in renal tissue may contribute to the progression of chronic renal disease and may be an early and sensitive indicator of renal damage in certain renal diseases.",

        "Abstract":"BACKGROUND: The aim of this retrospective study was to verify the role of renal biopsy in pregnancies complicated by renal dysfunction.\nMETHODS: A series of 15 percutaneous renal biopsies performed in 15 pregnant women with renal disease presenting during pregnancy over the past 10 years (1990-1999) were reviewed.\nRESULTS: All the patients underwent renal biopsy before 30 weeks of gestation. The indications for renal biopsy were renal dysfunction of unknown cause or symptomatic nephrotic syndrome (NS). Patients with toxemia were excluded. Eight women had lupus nephritis, including five with diffuse crescenteric changes and three with a mesangial proliferative pattern. Three had chronic glomerulonephritis (CGN), two had mesangial proliferative glomerulonephritis and one each had diabetic nephrosclerosis and endocapillary proliferative glomerulonephritis. There were no significant complications except in one patient who experienced gross hematuria. Early induction of labor was recommended for the four patients with diabetic nephrosclerosis or CGM. The other 11 patients received intravenous pulse methylprednisolone or high dose oral prednisolone therapy. The responses to steroid therapy in these 11 patients were as follows: five achieved complete remission of NS, three achieved incomplete remission, and three achieved partial remission. After 2 years' follow-up, seven mothers achieved complete remission, three had died, three developed chronic renal failure (CRF), and two progressed to end stage renal failure (ESRF) requiring chronic hemodialysis. Fourteen of the 15 pregnancies resulted in live births and the other child was stillborn.\nCONCLUSIONS: Renal biopsy performed during pregnancy is not contraindicated. The results of histopathological studies are extremely useful in counseling regarding continuation or termination of pregnancy, potential maternal and fetal outcome, and recommending specific therapeutic modalities.",

        "Abstract":"BACKGROUND: Transjugular renal biopsy (TJRB) is still a novel technique of renal tissue sampling exploiting the transjugular route. TJRB should be performed particularly in situations when the percutaneous route is precluded, i.e. especially in patients with clotting disorders. In the past, only a few papers reported the experience with larger numbers of patients. The goal of this paper is to analyze our experience with TJRB.\nMETHODS AND RESULTS: From 1993 to 1999, 67 patients, mean age 49.8 years (SD +\/- 10.2), male\/female ratio 40\/27, underwent TJRB. Fifty-two patients (78%) suffered from renal insufficiency and 19 of them (28%) were on dialysis treatment at the time of TJRB. Arterial hypertension was recorded in 42%. The combined kidney and liver biopsy (46%) and clotting disorders (39%) were the most frequent indications for performing TJRB. Renal tissue was yielded in 53 patients (79%) but a sample sufficient for histological diagnosis was taken in 49 (73%), reaching on average 10.8 glomeruli. Altogether 19 different histological entities were disclosed and out of them, vascular nephrosclerosis (12%), necrotizing and crescentic glomerulonephritis, IgA nephropathy (IgAN) and amyloidosis (three latter per 10%) represented the most frequent diagnoses. TJRB was combined with liver biopsy in 31 patients (46%) and\/or hepatic vein catheterization in 22 patients (33%) confirming portal hypertension in 8. The clinically significant liver histology was found in 20 patients, of them cirrhosis\/fibrosis in 8, chronic hepatitis in 4 and steatosis in 5. Among those 20 patients, IgAN was disclosed as the most common renal diagnosis (6). Clinically symptomatic complications were recorded in 12 cases (18%) but 9 of them suffered from clotting disorders. Complications included development of subcapsular hematoma in 6 cases, macroscopic hematuria in 4 cases, and hypovolemic hemorrhagic shock in 2. One patient had to undergo surgical treatment. Dividing the patients into a subgroup with or without clotting disorders, the complication rate was 34 vs. 7%.\nCONCLUSIONS: TJRB is a new diagnostic method, which, looking at its indications, facilitates the diagnosis of glomerulopathies in patients who could not be considered for percutaneous renal biopsy, particularly due to clotting disorders. The technical aspect of this procedure plays a fundamental role in the final risk\/benefit ratio but if done correctly it involves acceptable risk and is well tolerated.",

        "Abstract":"Renal transplantation is at present a standard therapeutic method in chronic renal insufficiency. For a favourable development of the graft some investigated criteria are of basic importance: basic diagnosis which led to renal failure, period of dialyzation treatment, high standard collection and perfusion and early diagnosis of the rejection episode. Non-invasive diagnostic methods of the rejection episode are always indirect and correlate with histologically confirmed rejection, depending on the period of transplantation in 10-90% patients. Indirect diagnosis is based in particular on a rise of the creatinemia, decline of glomerular filtration, fluid retention variations of blood pressure and increase of the Doppler assessed index of resistance (IR) in the peripheral veins of the graft [1]. For many years the role of nuclear diagnostics are tested. The disadvantage of direct diagnosis--biopsy--is increased haemorrhage and loss of the graft [1, 2, 3, 4]. The greatest problem is the differentiation of acute (cellular) rejection as compared with acute tubular necrosis during the initial days after transplantation. The authors describe their experience with 81 biopsies in the course of 3 years in patients during the first 10 days after transplantation, comparison with dynamic scintigraphy of the graft. Their attention is focused on the technique and risks of renal biopsy.",

We tried to clarify the differences in pathological findings between the young and the elderly, in Korea and in Western countries, and the usefulness of a percutaneous renal biopsy in the elderly with renal disease.\nPATIENTS AND METHODS: We analyzed the clinical presentations and spectrums of renal histopathology by reviewing medical records and renal biopsy reports retrospectively in 117 Korean patients aged 60 years or more with renal disease.\nRESULTS: 85 patients had primary renal disease. The remaining 32 patients had renal diseases associated with systemic conditions. Out of the 85 patients with primary renal disease, 61 cases presented as idiopathic nephrotic syndrome. Compared with renal biopsy results of younger adult patients (age 15-59, n = 1,908), membranous nephropathy, crescentic glomerulonephritis, membranoproliferative glomerulonephritis, amyloidosis, light chain disease, and thrombotic thrombocytopenic purpura were more prevalent, but IgA nephropathy and lupus nephritis were less common in the elderly patients. In clinical presentation, nephrotic syndrome and rapidly progressive renal failure were more prevalent, but asymptomatic urinary abnormality was less common in elderly patients. The responsiveness to treatment was good in elderly patients with minimal-change lesion (complete remission in all patients) but poor in crescentic glomerulonephritis, IgA nephropathy, and membranoproliferative glomerulonephritis. From the above findings, the clinical presentation, patterns of histopathology and responsiveness to treatment of elderly Korean patients were similar to those of the younger Korean control group and the Western elderly group.\nCONCLUSION: Percutaneous renal biopsy is a useful diagnostic aid and can be used as a therapeutic guideline even in elderly patients with renal disease.",

        "Abstract":"Colchicine is an alkaloid with antimitotic ability used to treat a variety of medical conditions. Colchicine toxicity can result in multiorgan failure and death. The histopathologic features of colchicine toxicity in gastrointestinal biopsies have not been reported. Twenty-one gastrointestinal mucosal biopsies obtained from nine patients receiving oral colchicine therapy were studied. Immunohistochemical staining for Ki67 proliferation antigen was performed, and medical records of each patient were reviewed. All patients had a history of gout. Four patients with chronic renal failure also had clinical evidence of colchicine toxicity, and the other five patients did not. Distinct morphologic changes, seen as metaphase mitoses, epithelial pseudostratification, and loss of polarity, were seen in biopsy material from 4 of 4 (100%) patients with clinical colchicine toxicity. Three of these four cases (75%) also contained abundant crypt apoptotic bodies. These morphologic features were best seen in the biopsies from duodenum and gastric antrum, with relative sparing of the gastric body in the upper gastrointestinal tract. Ki67 staining demonstrated an expansion of the proliferating region in three available cases with clinical colchicine toxicity. These distinctive morphologic features were not seen in the five patients without clinical colchicine toxicity. These results indicate that colchicine toxicity can produce diagnostic morphologic features in gastrointestinal mucosal biopsies. Recognition of these features is important because colchicine toxicity can be fatal if undiagnosed clinically.",

        "Abstract":"BACKGROUND: Tubulointerstitial fibrosis is an integral part of progressive renal disease. Human cortical fibroblasts are believed to be key effector cells in fibrogenesis. Thus, a reliable culture of these cells is necessary for studies of their pathophysiology.\nMETHODS: Cortical fibroblast culture from routine kidney biopsies were analyzed and the cells were characterized. Indirect immunofluorescence staining was done after the first passage for cytokeratin, vimentin, alpha-smooth muscle actin, CD 44, CD 54, CD 68, collagen types I, III, and HLA-DR. We then assessed the utility of the putative fibroblast markers CD 90, prolyl-4-hydroxylase (P4H) and F1b in simultaneous stainings of tubular epithelial cells.\nRESULTS: During the study period, 49 biopsy cores were cultured and cortical fibroblasts could be successfully established in 21 cases (42.9%). There was no relation between the success rate of culture and the degree of interstitial fibrosis, but an association was seen with the time of completion of the first passage. There was a negative correlation between the extent of scarring and the percentage of cytokeratin positive cells (r = -0.66, p < 0.001). All primary fibroblasts were negative for factor VIII, HLA-DR, CD 68, and cytokeratin. They expressed alpha-smooth muscle actin and collagen types I and III to variable degrees. There was a robust correlation between the percentage of alpha-smooth muscle actin positive cells and interstitial scarring but no such association with collagen type I or type III positive cells. The three putative fibroblast markers did not prove useful in differentiating between tubular epithelial cells and fibroblasts. However, since only fibroblasts stained positive for CD 90 and negative for cytokeratin, these two markers may suffice to distinguish fibroblasts from other renal cellular elements.\nCONCLUSIONS: Cortical renal fibroblasts can be easily cultured from kidney biopsy cores, though the success rate of pure cultures is below 50%. Staining for CD 90 and cytokeratin may suffice for initial characterization of these cells.",

An insight into the spectrum of clinically significant glomerulonephritis can be obtained from renal biopsy diagnoses. This is a descriptive report of biopsy-proven glomerulonephritis within a defined population.\nMETHODS: A retrospective review of the pathology reports of all native renal biopsies performed in the Australian state of Victoria in 1995 and 1997 was undertaken. Trends in the average annual age- and sex-specific incidence rates for biopsy-proven glomerulonephritis were calculated. Comparisons were made with the incidence of end-stage renal disease due to glomerulonephritis confirmed on renal biopsy.\nRESULTS: The most common glomerulonephritides in adults are IgA disease, focal glomerulosclerosis, lupus nephritis and vasculitis, and in children are lupus nephritis, focal glomerulosclerosis, IgA disease and minimal change disease. A male predominance is seen for all glomerulonephritides, except lupus nephritis, in both adults and children. An increase in incidence of disease with age, particularly in males, is seen for vasculitis and focal glomerulosclerosis. The most common glomerulonephritides on renal biopsy are reflected in the most common causes of end-stage renal disease due to glomerulonephritis.\nCONCLUSIONS: This review has provided population-based descriptive epidemiological data on clinically significant glomerulonephritis.

        "Abstract":"BACKGROUND: Congenital nephrotic syndrome is an uncommon disorder that may be caused by several diseases. These may be inherited, sporadic, acquired or part of a general malformation syndrome.\nMETHODS: We reviewed the clinical characteristics, pathologic findings, and results of medical management in 30 infants who presented to Jordan University Hospital with congenital nephrotic syndrome in the years 1989 to 1999.\nRESULTS: Most patients (80%) had parents who were consanguineous. Most patients (80%) were born premature, with an average gestational age of 36 weeks. Most infants (77%) presented the nephrotic syndrome in the first three months of life and 26 (87%) had significant growth retardation. Twenty-five verified episodes of serious bacterial infections occurred in 18 patients. Antibiotic therapy however was successful in all these episodes. Light microscopy of the renal biopsies was consistent with the Finnish type of congenital nephrosis in most patients (83%). Chronic renal insufficiency developed in 17, and five of them needed chronic peritoneal dialysis. Most patients were given albumin transfusion and diuretic therapy especially during episodes of severe edema. Captopril alone or in combination with ibuprofen was given to eight patients, but without a response in any of them. All patients died before the age of 5 years. Most deaths occurred at an average age of 15 months (range 1-60).\nCONCLUSION: The Finnish type of congenital nephrosis was the most common type in our patients, most of whom died within a few months of the onset of disease. In the developing countries, the management of patients with congenital nephrosis may have to be different from that in the developed countries in view of the high cost of medical management, poor outcome, high risk of serious complications, and high mortality rate.",

Prognostic value was analysed by the Kaplan-Meier method to study time between biopsy and onset of permanent dialysis.\nRESULTS: There was no significant bias between measurements by the same observer or different observers. The index of chronic damage ranged from 0 to 90%. Increasing severity of chronic damage was associated with shortened renal survival. Each increase of 10% in the index increased the hazard ratio of risk of permanent dialysis by 1.5 times (95% confidence interval 1.4-1.7, P<0.001).\nCONCLUSIONS: A simple measure of chronic damage was a powerful indicator of prognosis.

Renal parenchymal damage was analysed by morphometric analysis (of interstitial fibrosis and glomerulosclerosis) and a semi-quantitative chronic damage score (score 0-3 (normal-severe) for each of glomerulosclerosis, interstitial fibrosis, tubular atrophy, and arteriolar hyalinosis; maximum=12). Patients were stratified into two groups who had either deteriorating (group 1) or stable (group 2) renal function during follow-up.\nRESULTS: Twenty-five patients (age 64.7+\/-10.5, range 43-83 years; 17 male, eight female) were identified. Sixteen patients had undergone angiography; two had significant (>50%) renal artery stenosis. Mean follow-up was 25.6+\/-14.8 (range 5-50) months. Group 1 patients had DeltaCrCl -7.4+\/-6.8 ml\/min\/year, n=14 and group 2 patients had DeltaCrCl 4.8+\/-7.0 ml\/min\/year, n=11. Four patients in group 1 developed end-stage renal disease and five patients died (three in group 1 and two in group 2). At study entry, group 1 patients had worse renal function (CrCl 27.6+\/-17.6 vs 36.0+\/-33.9, NS), greater proteinuria (1.2 vs 0.5 g\/24 h, NS), and higher systolic blood pressure (167.1+\/-30.8 mmHg vs 150.6+\/-37.8, NS) compared with group 2 patients. Group 1 patients showed more glomerulosclerosis (51.6 vs 24.9%, P:<0.01), greater proportional interstitial volume (44.9 vs 33.9%, P:<0.02), and higher overall chronic damage score (P:<0.05) than those in group 2. There was a significant correlation between renal functional outcome and chronic damage score, glomerulosclerosis and proportional interstitial volume for the entire patient cohort.\nCONCLUSION: In patients with atherosclerotic nephropathy the severity of histopathological damage is an important determinant and predictor of renal functional outcome.",

        "Abstract":"PURPOSE: We report our experience relative to transcatheter percutaneous embolization of post-biopsy renal intraparenchymal arteriovenous fistulas in patients with chronic renal insufficiency.\nMATERIAL AND METHODS: We observed 5 patients affected with post-bioptic fistulas for possible embolization. In three cases the symptoms were represented by intermittent macro-microhematuria; one patient had hypertension of nephrovascular origin and one patient was asymptomatic. In all cases we performed angiography and it was possible to catheterize the peripheral afferent branch of the fistula with a superselective technique using a hydrophilic guide of 0.035 F and a hydrophilic Cobra catheter of 4-5 F. The occlusion was obtained by the positioning of Granturco metal coils: in 1 case we adapted a coil of 3 mm diameter and 1 cm length; in 3 cases 2 coils of 3 mm and in 1 case 2 coils of 3 mm and 1 coil of 5 mm diameter and 1 cm length were necessary. The success of the procedure was always checked with an immediate angiogram and color Doppler US after 48 hrs.\nRESULTS: The diagnosis of arteriovenous fistulas was always confirmed by a preliminary angiography that demonstrated the normal anatomic disposition of the renal arteries except in one case in which the fistula was fed by a peripheral branch originating from an inferior polar artery. All the lesions were localized in the inferior pole, the site of biopsy, and ranged from 3 mm to 2.5 cm in diameter. We never had any difficulties in the positioning and placement of the coils. The arterial occlusion and exclusion of the fistula was accomplished in all cases. The induced parenchymal loss ranged from 10 to 30% of the renal volume. There was a complete disappearance of symptoms in 3 of the patients, with hematuria without any modification of the blood pressure values in the patient with hypertension. Considering the patient status renal function did not worsen after the embolization. Each patient was followed-up with color Doppler US every two months.\nCONCLUSIONS: The intrarenal arteriovenous fistula represents a relative frequent complication of renal needle biopsy in patients with arterial hypertension and nephroangiosclerosis as risk factors. Embolization is a valid alternative therapeutic option to surgical treatments. The use of small size catheters permits the successful embolization also of peripheral lesions, reducing the induced parenchymal ischemia. We believe that among the embolization material available metal coils represent a valid solution as they are easily positioned and permit definitive occlusion without any risks of systemic venous microembolization.",

        "Abstract":"BACKGROUND: A new Biopsy Index containing the Glomerular Activity (GAI), Tubulointerstitial Activity (TIAI), Chronic Lesion (CLI), and Immunofluorescence (IFI) indices was developed, showing better correlations with clinical and outcome parameters than the National Institutes of Health Activity and Chronicity Indices (AI and CI) in lupus nephritis. This report examines the ability of these indices and individual morphologic variables to predict doubling of serum creatinine (SCr; CRX2).\nMETHODS: Renal biopsies from 71 patients with lupus nephritis with an initial biopsy (Bx1) and systematic control biopsy (Bx2) after six months of therapy were studied. Kaplan-Meier survival curves were developed for each index and morphologic variable at each biopsy. A subset of 30 biopsies was stained with the macrophage marker PGM1.\nRESULTS: At Bx1, only the TIAI and the quantity of C3 and vascular staining on IF were predictive of CRX2. At Bx2, particularly predictive of CRX2 were the GAI, IFI, Biopsy Index, and BxInfl, a composite variable comprised of all of the inflammatory variables. Among individual variables, glomerular and tubular macrophages correlated the best with clinical and outcome parameters. Crescents and karyorrhexis\/fibrinoid necrosis also correlated with outcome. Neither the NIH CI or our CLI, nor the TIAI correlated with outcome. In 30 biopsies stained with PGM1, PGM1+ cells correlated well with glomerular and tubular macrophages identified on routine stains and showed even better correlations with SCr, proteinuria, and progression to renal insufficiency than the latter. A diffuse membranoproliferative (MPGN) pattern was seen in seven patients at Bx1. In four of the seven patients, MPGN disappeared with therapy, and all finished with normal renal function. However, among the three patients in whom MPGN persisted and eight patients in whom MPGN, focal or diffuse, appeared under therapy, six reached end-stage renal disease, and a seventh died with marked renal insufficiency.\nCONCLUSIONS: The biopsy index and its components correlate modestly with CRX2 at Bx1, but strongly at Bx2, particularly IFI, BxInfl, and glomerular and tubular macrophages. Stains for macrophage markers form a valuable adjunct in interpretation of renal biopsies in systemic lupus erythematosus (SLE). MPGN features do not have an ominous significance at Bx1, but their persistence or appearance under therapy are associated with poor outcome.",

The women had been amenorrheic for 13+\/-4 years and 7 patients (11%) had a positive fracture history.\nMETHODS: A bone biopsy was taken after tetracycline labelling and BMD of the lumbar spine and proximal femur was measured by dual-energy X-ray absorptiometry (DEXA); serum intact parathyroid hormone (iPTH), bone Gla protein (BGP), phosphorus, calcium and alkaline phosphatase (ALP) were also determined.\nRESULTS: Histologically, 40 patients showed secondary hyperparathyroidism (sHPT), 6 mixed bone disease, 14 adynamic bone disease (A) and 2 osteomalacia. BMD of the lumbar spine was decreased in 43 patients (69%) and in 9 (14.5%) it was lower than -2 Z score units. BMD of the femoral neck was low in 55 patients (89%) and in 22 (35.5%) it was lower than -2 Z scores. BMD was lower in patients with sHPT than in those with adynamic bone disease (p<0.05) in which it was close to normal.

Histological parameters at the initial biopsy of patients with DPLN that would predict the progression of renal pathology or function at the second biopsy are not clearly defined.\nMETHODS: The prognostic significance of renal histological indices, such as glomerular activity index and volume density of cortical interstitium [Vv(int\/cortex)], was evaluated from successive renal biopsies in 21 patients with DPLN.\nRESULTS: At the time of the second biopsies, performed an average of 43 months after the first biopsies, seven patients (33%) showed progressive renal insufficiency. Only three cases (14%) transformed to World Health Organization class I or III. The seven patients with clinical progression exhibited a higher frequency of hypertension, higher percent glomerulosclerosis, and larger Vv(int\/cortex) at the time of second biopsy as compared with the 14 patients without renal insufficiency. At the first biopsy, patients with clinical progression showed a higher glomerular activity index (2.9+\/-1.2 vs 1.3+\/-0.8, P<0.05) and larger Vv(int\/cortex) (0.13+\/-0.07 microm(3)\/microm(3) vs 0.05+\/-0.03 microm(3)\/microm(3), P<0.05) than the patients without progression. The glomerular activity index at the first biopsy correlated directly with per cent glomerulosclerosis, Vv(int\/cortex), and serum creatinine level at the second biopsy. Vv(int\/cortex) in the first biopsy also showed a significant relation with per cent glomerulosclerosis and serum creatinine level at the second biopsy.\nCONCLUSIONS: These results suggest that higher glomerular activity and larger interstitial volume density at the initial biopsy can predict future progression of renal pathology or function in DPLN.",

In a cohort of 471 patients with pSS who were followed for a mean of 10 years, 20 patients (4.2%) developed overt renal disease. Eighteen patients underwent a percutaneous renal biopsy; 2 patients declined. Ten patients had IN, 8 patients had GMN, and 2 patients presented with both entities. Glomerular histology disclosed changes compatible with membranoproliferative GMN in 5 patients and mesangial proliferative GMN in 4 patients. Patients with IN had a younger disease onset compared with patients with GMN (mean, 36.8 compared with 46.0 yr, p 5 0.063). Patients with GMN had longer disease duration compared with patients with IN (mean, 2.2 compared with 8.0 yr, p 5 0.001). The majority of patients with GMN (80%) had mixed monoclonal cryoglobulinemia IgMk (type II) and lower complement C4 levels. Two patients (both with GMN) developed chronic renal failure requiring hemodialysis. Overall, clinically significant renal involvement is infrequent in pSS.

This study investigated the diagnostic efficacy of carbon 13 ((13)C)-labeled UBT for H pylori detection in 70 patients with end-stage renal disease (ESRD) undergoing hemodialysis (HD) and 70 dyspeptic controls without renal impairment. With H pylori infection defined as a positive result on either histological examination or culture of gastric biopsy specimen, we evaluated the reliability of the (13)C-UBT in detecting H pylori infection in both groups. To ascertain whether HD therapy affects the diagnostic efficacy of the UBT, the test was performed twice in patients with ESRD (before and after HD) at least 72 hours apart. In each UBT session, the baseline, 10-minute, and 15-minute (Delta15) gas samples were obtained to analyze excess (13)CO(2)\/(12)CO(2) ratio (ECR). Histological stain and\/or culture studies found that 33 of the patients with ESRD (47. 1%) and 42 of the control patients (60%) had H pylori infection. (13)C-UBT for H pylori detection in patients with ESRD was found to be only 93.8% sensitive and 85.3% specific. These results were achieved by gas sampling (Delta15) after HD therapy with a cutoff ECR value greater than 5. Conversely, the UBT in the control group achieved the greatest diagnostic efficacy (sensitivity, 97.6%; specificity, 96.4%) with a comparatively lower ECR cutoff value of 4. We conclude that the diagnostic accuracy for H pylori detection in patients with ESRD could be improved by performing (13)C-UBT (Delta15) after HD therapy and assessing the UBT with a cutoff ECR value greater than 5. However, the diagnostic efficacy of the UBT for patients with ESRD remained less accurate than that for dyspeptic patients without renal impairment.",

        "Abstract":"In children who exhibit a frequently relapsing course of minimal change disease (MCD), treatment is often difficult and frustrating to the physician and the family since the goal of a sustained remission remains elusive. The progression of the disease is often unpredictable from its clinical presentation since the lesion of MCD may evolve into a more severe form, such as mesangial IgM nephropathy or focal segmental glomerulosclerosis (FSGS), without alteration in signs and symptoms. Alkylating agents such as cyclophosphamide, or immunosuppressives such as cyclosporine can induce a more sustained remission, but are fraught with inherent toxicity, which makes difficult the decision to use these drugs in patients with MCD. Over a 10-year period we studied 49 patients who had more than one renal biopsy. Repeat biopsies were performed either to delineate the morphological lesion prior to change in therapy, or to confirm suspected drug toxicity, which would necessitate discontinuation of therapy. A total of 83 repeat biopsies were performed in these 49 patients. Of the 49 patients, 25 had MCD, and in 21 of these the lesion evolved into either IgM nephropathy (n = 7) or FSGS (n = 14). Of patients with IgM nephropathy (n = 12), 50% evolved into FSGS. The clinical diagnosis made prior to the repeat biopsy did not confirm with the histological diagnosis in 43% of cases, and a change in therapy or cessation of therapy was carried out in 43 of 83 repeat biopsy instances. Since the complications were mild and the ability of clinical findings to accurately predict the histological lesion limited, we conclude that repeat renal biopsies are a useful tool to fashion optimal therapy in children with frequently relapsing nephrotic syndrome.",

The decrease is characterized by swelling and lesions in the head and neck region, with involvement of the subcutaneous soft tissue, major salivary glands, and lymph nodes. Patients almost always have eosinophilia and elevated serum immunoglobulin E levels. The diagnosis is established by biopsy. Kimura's disease is usually self-limiting. Its etiology is unknown but is thought to be a manifestation of an aberrant allergic response. In this paper, we describe the case of a 30-year-old patient who was diagnosed with Kimura's disease at our institution.",

        "Abstract":"Indications for renal biopsy are still ill defined. We recently sent a detailed questionnaire to 360 nephrologists in different areas of the world with the aim of providing information on this critical issue by evaluating the replies. The questionnaire was organized in four sections that included questions on renal biopsy indications in patients with normal renal function, renal insufficiency, and a transplanted kidney. In addition, the questions included methods applied to each renal biopsy procedure and to specimen processing. We received 166 replies; North Europe (50 replies), South Europe (47 replies), North America (31 replies), Australia and New Zealand (24 replies), and other countries (14 replies). In patients with normal renal function, primary indications for renal biopsy were microhematuria associated with proteinuria, particularly greater than 1 g\/d of protein. In chronic renal insufficiency, kidney dimension was the major parameter considered before renal biopsy, whereas the presence of diabetes or serological abnormalities was not considered critical. In the course of acute renal failure (ARF) of unknown origin, 20% of the respondents would perform renal biopsy in the early stages, 26% after 1 week of nonrecovery, and 40% after 4 weeks. In a transplanted kidney, the majority of nephrologists would perform a renal biopsy in the case of graft failure after surgery, ARF after initial good function, slow progressive deterioration of renal function, and onset of nephrotic proteinuria. The last section provided comprehensive information on the technical aspects of renal biopsy. This survey represents the first attempt to provide a reliable consensus that can be used in developing guidelines on the use of kidney biopsy.",

        "Abstract":"Acute renal insufficiency is a common problem, yet one that is frequently reversible with proper diagnosis and treatment. Although it has been argued that a renal biopsy is not needed for diagnosis in most cases of acute renal failure in the elderly, other studies have shown frequent disagreements between clinical and renal biopsy diagnoses in such cases. To investigate the causes of acute renal insufficiency in patients aged at least 60 years who underwent a renal biopsy and possible correlations between biopsy findings and renal survival, we first identified all native renal biopsy specimens from patients aged 60 years or older processed at The University of Chicago Medical Center (Chicago, IL) from 1991 through 1998 and reviewed the clinical records to determine the indication for the biopsy. We then reviewed again the records of those patients who underwent biopsy because of acute renal insufficiency, recorded the primary renal biopsy diagnosis in each of these cases, and obtained follow-up information for patients who underwent biopsy before July 1996. During the study period, 1,065 of 4,264 biopsy specimens (25.0%) received were obtained from patients aged 60 years or older, and acute renal insufficiency was the indication for biopsy in 259 of these patients (24.3%). The most frequent primary diagnoses on these latter biopsy specimens were pauci-immune crescentic glomerulonephritis (GN) with or without arteritis, 31.2% of biopsy specimens; acute interstitial nephritis, 18.6%; acute tubular necrosis (ATN) with nephrotic syndrome, 7.5%; atheroemboli, 7.1%; ATN alone, 6.7%; light chain cast nephropathy (LCCN), 5.9%; postinfectious GN, 5.5%; anti-glomerular basement membrane antibody nephritis, 4.0%; and immunoglobulin A (IgA) nephropathy and\/or Henoch-Schönlein nephritis, 3.6%. Eight biopsy specimens (3.2%) showed only benign nephrosclerosis without an apparent cause of acute renal insufficiency, and another six specimens were inadequate. The renal biopsy diagnosis was in agreement with the prebiopsy clinical diagnosis (or differential diagnosis) in 107 of the 161 cases (67%) in which such information was provided. The distribution of diagnoses was similar in patients in the age groups of 60 to 69, 70 to 79, and 80 years or older, although younger age correlated significantly with improved renal and patient survival. The relative risk for progression to end-stage renal disease (ESRD) also increased according to diagnostic categories: LCCN (greatest risk) > GN other than pauci-immune > atheroemboli congruent with pauci-immune crescentic GN > tubulointerstitial diseases other than LCCN (the latter category including ATN with nephrotic syndrome). Development of ESRD correlated significantly with decreased patient survival. In summary, renal biopsy in patients aged 60 years or older with acute renal insufficiency uncovered the cause in greater than 90% of the cases and provided clinically useful information with respect to expectation for renal survival and potential treatment options.",

        "Abstract":"Muscle wasting and weakness occur frequently in patients with chronic renal failure. The mechanism(s) by which these abnormalities occur is unclear. We hypothesized that such findings were due to defective muscle protein synthesis. We measured synthetic rates of mixed muscle proteins, myosin heavy chain, and mitochondrial proteins in serial muscle biopsy samples during a continuous infusion of L[1-(13)C]leucine from 12 patients with chronic renal failure and 10 healthy control subjects under identical study conditions. Patients with chronic renal failure have significantly lower synthetic rates of mixed muscle proteins and myosin heavy chain (27 and 37% reductions, respectively, P < 0.05 and P < 0.02). Significant declines in the synthetic rates of muscle mitochondrial protein (27%) (P < 0.05), muscle cytochrome c-oxidase activity (42%) (P < 0.007), and citrate synthase (27%) (P < 0.007) were also observed in patients with chronic renal failure. The synthetic rates of muscle proteins and activity of mitochondrial enzymes were negatively correlated to the severity of renal failure. These results indicate that in chronic renal failure there is a decrease in the synthesis of muscle contractile and mitochondrial proteins and a decrease in muscle mitochondrial oxidative enzymes. Reduced synthetic rate of several muscle proteins is the likely biochemical basis of muscle loss and muscle weakness in people with chronic renal failure.",

A renal cyst was defined as a tubule dilated >200 microm.\nRESULTS: Renal cysts were found in 21 of 720 renal biopsy specimens. Serum creatinine of 21 patients with renal cysts was significantly higher than that of 699 patients without cysts (2.59 +\/- 2.64 vs. 1.09 +\/- 0.79 mg\/dl) (p < 0.0001). Poor renal function (serum creatinine >1.6 mg\/dl) reveals more cyst formation on biopsy specimens than good renal function (serum creatinine <1.5 mg\/dl). Cysts were observed in 11 of 607 (1.8%) patients less than 50 years of age and in 10 of 113 (8.8%) patients over 51 years. To exclude simple cysts which are commonly observed in older subjects, 11 patients under 50 years of age were extensively examined. Mean serum creatinine was 2.98 +\/- 3.06 mg\/dl (0.7-10.4 mg\/dl). These 11 patients revealed low creatinine clearance of 47.5 +\/- 25.6 ml\/min (5-71 ml\/min). Creatinine clearances in 7 patients were 52-71 ml\/min (serum creatinine 0.7-2.0 mg\/ dl). One of 11 biopsy specimens with cysts was examined by immunohistochemistry on lectin. This specimen was positive for tetragonolobus lectin and negative for peanut lectin, suggesting that the epithelial cells lining the cyst were derived from proximal tubules, unlike those of simple cysts.\nCONCLUSION: These results suggest that low normal renal function such as creatinine clearances 52-71 ml\/min due to nephron loss is sufficient to induce acquired cyst development in various renal diseases.",

Forty-four participants were interviewed separately (22 patients and their partners) by way of two open-ended questions, and multiple themes were identified from verbatim transcripts. Both the patients and partners viewed their relationship very positively, and both were overwhelmed by the impact of dialysis on their lives. Anger, depression and hopelessness were evident in the patients, whilst a pervasive sadness, resentment, guilt and loss were prevalent in the partners. This study gives a unique perspective on the negative impact which dialysis can have on couples, yet it also suggests that some are able to cope in a positive way despite the many life-style adjustments required by dialysis. The results of this study indicate that nurses need to recognize and respond to the tremendous emotional impact that chronic illness and its treatment can have on families in an era where it is possible to sustain life for years with the use of life support technology.",

We observed three cases of AVF (two in allograft kidneys, one in a native kidney) among all biopsies (0.34%), and the incidence of developing AVF after renal allograft biopsy was 6.3%. All three patients with AVF were symptomatic, and intravascular therapy was indicated.\nINTERVENTIONS: An angiographic study combined with endovascular treatment of the intrarenal AVF and pseudoaneurysm was performed in all three patients. Embolization was performed with bucrylate and lipiodol in two patients and with micro-coils in one. After successful embolization, all three patients became asymptomatic (in two renal bleeding stopped, in one patient with severe uncontrollable hypertension blood pressure returned to normal limits).

Decreased erythropoietin (EPO) production is the main pathogenetic factor, but iron deficiency is the primary cause of unresponsiveness to EPO therapy. The diagnosis of iron deficiency in patients with chronic renal failure is difficult. We assessed the sensitivity and specificity of serum ferritin, total iron-binding capacity, transferrin saturation index, erythrocyte ferritin, and serum transferrin receptor in 63 patients with chronic renal failure undergoing dialysis (47 men, 16 women) with iron deficiency anemia. They were selected on the basis of clinical stability and absence of factors that may interfere with iron metabolism. None of the patients had received intravenous iron therapy or recombinant human erythropoietin (rHuEPO). Bone marrow biopsy with iron staining was the reference standard for iron stores. The receiver operating characteristic (ROC) curve and the area under the curve were calculated to assess the sensitivity and specificity of iron metabolism parameters. The parameter with the largest area under the ROC curve was serum ferritin (0.83). A cut point of 121 microgram\/L showed a sensitivity and a specificity of 75%. The areas under the ROC curves of serum transferrin receptor and erythrocyte ferritin were 0.69 and 0.68, respectively. The remaining parameters showed areas under the ROC curve less than 0.65. Although serum transferrin receptor and erythrocyte ferritin may be acceptable markers for iron deficiency in stable chronic renal failure patients, serum ferritin level continues to be the most reliable diagnostic parameter. Transferrin saturation index is not a reliable parameter for the diagnosis of iron deficiency in stable patients not treated with rHuEPO.",

Laboratory examination revealed renal failure (BUN 134 mg\/dl, serum Cr 7.3 mg\/dl), severe normocytic normochromic anemia (hemoglobin 4.3 g\/dl), hypercalcemia (11.8 mg\/dl), and hyperphosphatemia (9.7 mg\/dl). Serum PTH levels were extremely increased (intact PTH >1,000 pg\/ml: normal range 10-50 pg\/ml). X-ray examination of the skull and shoulders showed a salt and pepper appearance, and cauliflower-like deformity of the distal end of both clavicles, respectively. Accelerated ectopic calcification was observed in the costal cartilages, internal carotid arteries, and splenic arteries. Ultrasonographic examination revealed enlargement of the four parathyroid glands. Thallium-technetium subtraction scintigraphy of the parathyroid glands showed increased uptake into the upper two. Renal needle biopsy revealed severe impairment of the interstitium and tubules with much milder changes in glomeruli. The etiology of the renal failure could not be identified. Hemodialysis, total parathyroidectomy and auto-transplantation into the forearm were immediately performed. The pathological diagnosis was chief cell hyperplasia of the parathyroid glands.

These glomerular changes were always accompanied by tubular microcysts and ultrastructurally, tubuloreticular inclusions (TRI) within the glomerular endothelium were often noted. Changes of HIVAN were also seen in two cases who were HIV negative at the time of biopsy but were positive on repeat testing. Minimal change disease, mesangiocapillary glomerulonephritis and diffuse proliferative lupus nephritis were other biopsy lesions. Autopsy findings were HIVAN (33 percent), tubular necrosis and opportunistic infections.

        "Abstract":"Primary chronic glomerulonephritis is the most common cause of end-stage renal failure in Japan. The incidence in dialysis patients in Japan is about four times higher than in the United States for reason which are unclear. We conducted a nationwide survey on the natural history and treatment of primary glomerulonephritis under a program project from the Ministry of Health and Welfare of Japan entitled 'Progressive Chronic Renal Disease'. We analyzed patient characteristics, disease onset, clinical data, and histological findings in 1,850 patients with primary glomerulonephritis from 53 institutions in 1985 who underwent renal biopsy at least 5 years ago, and the follow-up study was carried out 8 years after registration. The incidence of diffuse-mesangial proliferative glomerulonephritis is 41.9%, that of minor glomerular abnormalities 17.5%, and that of focal-mesangial proliferative glomerulonephritis 13.0%. Of 1,045 biopsy specimens that were examined by immunofluorescence microscopy, 47.4% showed IgA nephropathy. Half of all cases with primary chronic glomerulonephritis were asymptomatic and were detected on routine health examination. The survival rates at 20 years from the apparent onset or earliest known renal abnormality are: focal glomerular sclerosis 49%, membranoproliferative glomerulonephritis 58%, diffuse-mesangial proliferative glomerulonephritis 66%, focal-proliferative glomerulonephritis 81%, membranous nephropathy 82%, minor glomerular abnormalities 94%, and IgA nephropathy 61%. In conclusion, a high incidence of IgA nephropathy and a better renal survival of membranous nephropathy are the features of primary chronic glomerulonephritis in Japan. This high incidence of IgA nephropathy together with its poor prognosis is probably the reason for the increased incidence of primary chronic glomerulonephritis in dialysis patients in Japan. In addition, the importance of routine health examination including urinalysis is demonstrated.",

        "Abstract":"The renin-angiotensin system plays an important role in the progression of chronic renal disease. Although the expression of renin and angiotensin-converting enzyme in experimental and human renal disease has been well characterized, no information is available regarding human angiotensin type 1 (AT1) receptor expression. The net effect of renin depends on AT1 receptor expression, among other factors. Receptor expression was determined in renal biopsy samples (including all tissue components) and isolated glomeruli from patients with glomerulonephritis (GN) or diabetic nephropathy (non-insulin-dependent diabetes mellitus). Biopsy samples and isolated glomeruli from tumor-free tissue from tumor nephrectomies served as controls. Human AT1 receptor gene expression was determined by quantitative reverse transcription-PCR, using an AT1 receptor deletion mutant as the internal standard. In whole biopsy samples from 37 patients with various types of GN, AT1 receptor mRNA levels were lower, compared with nine control biopsy samples (P < 0.001). AT1 receptor mRNA levels were also significantly lower (P < 0.001) in eight samples from patients with diabetic nephropathy. In microdissected glomeruli, AT1 receptor gene expression was significantly lower in samples from patients (n = 22) with various types of GN, compared with 12 microdissected tumor nephrectomy control samples (P < 0.0023). It is concluded that AT1 receptor mRNA expression is low in glomeruli of patients with chronic renal disease. This may reflect a regulatory response to (inappropriately) high intrarenal angiotensin II concentrations.",

The association of anticardiolipin antibodies and\/or lupus anticoagulant with the development of a vaso-occlusive process involving numerous organs is now confirmed. In a multicenter study, 16 cases of \"primary\" APS (PAPS) were found and followed for 5 yr or more, all with renal biopsy. In all 16 cases of PAPS, there was a vascular nephropathy characterized by small vessel vaso-occlusive lesions associated with fibrous intimal hyperplasia of interlobular arteries (12 patients), recanalizing thrombi in arteries and arterioles (six patients), and focal cortical atrophy (10 patients). In combination, these led to progressive destruction of the kidney, accelerated by acute glomerular and arteriolar microangiopathy in five patients. Focal cortical atrophy is a distinctive lesion, present in 10 biopsies, and likely represents the histologic and functional renal analogue to the multiple cerebral infarcts detected on imaging studies. The clinical hallmark of this vascular nephropathy in PAPS is systemic hypertension, only variably associated with renal insufficiency, proteinuria, or hematuria. The ensemble of histologic renal lesions defined in this study should aid in the separation of the lesions found in cases of secondary APS, especially systemic lupus erythematosus, into those lesions related to APS and those related to the underlying disease.",

Patients with mild bone disease were on dialysis for shorter periods of time and were mostly asymptomatic. Patients with aluminum-related bone disease (16.5%) had the greatest aluminum exposure, either orally or parenterally, and together with patients with high turnover mixed disease, were the most symptomatic. Although on a non-regular basis, the vast majority of the patients (82.5%) had been receiving vitamin D. The incidence of adynamic bone disease was high (n = 8) among parathyroidectomized patients (n = 12). Significantly higher serum levels of alkaline phosphatase were observed in osteitis fibrosa.\nCONCLUSIONS: The use of calcitriol and phosphate-binding agents on a non-regular basis seems to be the reason for the apparent reduced response to the treatment of secondary hyperparathyroidism. Alkaline phosphatase has been shown to be a fair marker for bone turnover in patients with osteitis fibrosa. The severity of the clinical manifestations of bone disease correlates with the histological features of bone lesion and to the time spent on dialysis.",

        "Abstract":"A percutaneous renal biopsy can be performed in several ways, including using a spring-loaded biopsy gun. As this form of renal biopsy has become more popular, a controversy has developed regarding tissue adequacy and the incidence of complications. To compare these two aspects in an automated biopsy and a manual biopsy, we studied 166 patients assigned to one of the two renal biopsy methods. In a randomized, prospective manner from June 1994 until February 1997, group 1 (67 patients) received a 14 G Tru-cut needle (Baxter, Deerfield, IL) manual biopsy while group 2 (99 patients) received an 18 G automated gun biopsy. There was no difference in sex, age, hemoglobin level, prothrombin time, partial thromboplastin time, or diastolic and systolic blood pressure prebiopsy in groups I and II. Indications for biopsy were proteinuria (38%), proteinuria accompanied by hematuria (31.3%), acute renal failure (9.6%), lupus nephropathy (9.6%), chronic renal failure (6%), and hematuria only (5.4%). In group I, the number of cores was 1.88 +\/- 0.56, the glomeruli obtained were 27.3 +\/- 13.8, and the number of glomeruli per core were 15.3 +\/- 8.4. In group II, the values were 2.37 +\/- 0.88, 20.7 +\/- 11.1, and 9.95 +\/- 6.9, respectively. These results showed a statistically significant difference (P < 0.05). In all cases, pathological diagnosis was possible. The histology showed IgA nephropathy in 25.9%, minimal change disease in 16.3%, lupus nephritis in 11.4%, membranous glomerulonephropathy in 9.3%, membranoproliferative glomerulonephritis in 5.4%, and others. The incidence of postbiopsy hematoma was marginally greater in group I (22.3% v 11.1%) and the area of perirenal hematoma shown on ultrasound 24 hours postbiopsy was larger in group I, as well (848 +\/- 623 mm2 v 338 +\/- 260 mm2). Hematocrit levels before and after biopsy showed a significant difference (34.9% +\/- 7.9% and 34.0% +\/- 7.6%, respectively; P < 0.05) in group I, but no significant difference was observed in group II (35.1% +\/- 7.0% and 34.7% +\/- 6.9%). Both techniques rendered adequate tissue sampling, but the extent of bleeding was more severe with the manual 14 G Tru-cut needle biopsy.",

        "Abstract":"BACKGROUND: Intraglomerular lipid deposition is frequently observed in routine renal biopsies, and it has been suggested that lipid peroxidation of low density lipoprotein (LDL) may be implicated in the pathogenesis of progressive glomerulosclerosis. We have examined whether oxidized LDL (Ox-LDL) is present in the glomeruli of patients with renal disease and whether intrinsic human glomerular cells express NADPH-oxidase (a superoxide-generating enzyme found in professional phagocytes).\nMETHODS: Immunocytochemical study was performed on 939 renal biopsy specimens, using monoclonal antibodies (mAbs) OL-10, 48 and 449, and polyclonal antibody against human apolipoprotein (apo) B. Mouse mAb OL-10 recognizes malondialdehyde (MDA)-modified peptide epitope, and mAbs 48 and 449 react with alpha and beta subunits of cytochrome b558, an essential component of NADPH-oxidase.\nRESULTS: Sixty-two (6.6%) of the 939 patients with renal disease exhibited a staining for MDA-altered protein or Ox-LDL in the glomeruli, mainly in the sclerotic segments or mesangial areas. Group 1 patients with heavy Ox-LDL deposition mainly in the sclerotic segments showed a higher frequency of renal insufficiency and heavy proteinuria and a greater degree of glomerulosclerosis, compared to those in group 2 with mesangial Ox-LDL staining. The distribution of MDA protein epitopes, in general, paralleled the deposition of apo B epitopes. Immunoelectron microscopy of ultrathin frozen sections showed the presence of immunogold particles for mAbs 48 and 449 in the cytoplasm of resident glomerular cells of both normal and diseased kidneys. When immunoblotted with mAb OL-10, one band from the IgA nephropathy and focal segmental glomerulosclerosis groups at approximately 260 kD was labeled, whereas immunostaining of normal control samples revealed no staining.\nCONCLUSIONS: These results indicate that Ox-LDL is present mainly in the lesions of glomerulosclerosis and mesangial areas in human renal biopsies. They also suggest that patients with heavy Ox-LDL accumulation in the sclerotic segments of glomeruli have more advanced renal disease than those with mesangial Ox-LDL and that resident glomerular cells generate cytochrome b558, the potential of which may not suffice to induce peroxidation of LDL in the diseased glomeruli.",

The diagnostic value of core biopsies and ultrasound examinations, the prevalence of complications, and the applicability of the diagnostic tools in the evaluation of the graft status and viability were analyzed. In the early postoperative period, graft rupture occurred more frequently after biopsy than in the late period (7.4% vs 0.82%), this leading graft loss in 18 of 20 cases. The sonographically diagnosed morphologic and functional changes were also analyzed. Sonography proved a very accurate method for the detection of perirenal fluid collections and masses and severe vascular complications. The data demonstrated that biopsy is indicated in the early postoperative period when the result of sonography is doubtful.

In this retrospective study we evaluated our use of renal biopsy in patients who presented between 1985 and 1995 with microscopic hematuria but without proteinuria, hypertension or renal insufficiency.

Hematuria resolved in 23 patients. Only 11 patients were still attending the nephrology clinic and 27% of the patients who were advised to continue annual follow-up with family doctors had not done so.

Laparoscopic renal biopsy has recently been reported as an alternative to open renal biopsy.\nMETHODS: Thirty-two patients who had proteinuria and\/or renal insufficiency underwent laparoscopic renal biopsy at our center. The indications for biopsy included failed percutaneous biopsy (N = 3), morbid obesity (14), solitary kidney (5), chronic anticoagulation\/coagulopathy (6), religious consideration (refusal of potential blood transfusion) (2), multiple bilateral renal cysts and body habitus (1 case each). The kidney was approached via a laparoscopic retroperitoneal route (retroperitoneoscopy) using a two port technique. The lower pole of the kidney was localized using blunt dissection, laparoscopic cup biopsies were performed, and hemostasis was achieved using standard techniques.\nRESULTS: All biopsies were successfully completed laparoscopically with sufficient tissue obtained for histopathological diagnosis in all cases. Mean estimated blood loss was 25.9 ml (range 5 to 100). None of the patients required parenteral narcotics during the perioperative period. Operative time ranged from 0.8 to 3.0 hours (mean 1.5). Mean hospital stay was 1.7 days (range 0 to 7). Sixteen patients were treated as outpatients. Patients returned to normal activity at a mean of 1.7 weeks (range 0.3 to 3.0) postoperatively. In one patient, the spleen was inadvertently biopsied without consequence. An additional patient developed a postoperative 300 cc perinephric hematoma that resolved without the need for intervention. One postoperative mortality occurred on postoperative day seven secondary to a perforated peptic ulcer in a patient undergoing high-dose steroid therapy for lupus nephritis.\nCONCLUSION: Laparoscopic renal biopsy is a safe, reliable, minimally invasive alternative to open renal biopsy for patients in whom a closed percutaneous approach is either a relative or absolute contraindication, which can be performed on an outpatient basis.",

A renal diseases registry has been set up in an attempt to address this issue nationwide, and we report here the first outcome of this endeavor, a retrospective histopathologic analysis of 490 native kidney biopsies performed on adult patients presenting to four hospitals in the Emirate of Abu Dhabi from 1978 to June 1996. The most common indication for a biopsy was the nephrotic syndrome (54.0%), followed by asymptomatic urinary abnormalities (29.7%), and chronic renal failure (12.7%). Primary glomerular disease accounted for 77.1% of all biopsies. Chronic proliferative glomerulonephritis as a group was the predominant pathology (36.2%), followed by idiopathic membranous glomerulopathy (20.1%), focal segmental glomerulosclerosis (18.3%), minimal change nephropathy (18.3%), and IgA nephropathy (6.3%). Of the patients with secondary kidney diseases, 33 (40.7%) had systemic lupus erythematosis, 27 (33.3%) amyloidosis, 14 interstitial nephropathy, and seven diabetic nephropathy. Kidney biopsies of 187 patients with primary glomerular disease who presented with the nephrotic syndrome were analyzed. In this group idiopathic membranous glomerulopathy, proliferative glomerulonephritis, and minimal change glomerulopathy was found in almost equal proportions (28.3%, 26.6%, 26.2%) with focal segmental glomerulosclerosis (15.4%) accounting for the bulk of the remainder. Though the overall results of this analysis do not show any major differences in the spectrum of primary glomerulopathies in the United Arab Emirates compared with other countries, a slight tendency towards a higher frequency of focal segmental glomerulosclerosis among patients indigenous to the Arabian Peninsular (20.4%) deserves further evaluation.",

        "Abstract":"To characterize the magnitude and location of mineralized bone loss, 40 patients (20 men, 20 women, 29 white, 11 black) with clinically significant renal osteodystrophy who could be unambiguously classified based on histologic criteria as having osteitis fibrosa (OF; 20 cases) or osteomalacia (OM; 20 cases) were studied; they had been on maintenance hemodialysis for 4.6 +\/- 3.0 yr. One hundred forty-two healthy women of similar age and ethnic composition served as control subjects. In all subjects, the proportions of mineralized bone, osteoid, and porosity (nonbone soft tissue) were measured separately in cortical and cancellous bone tissue, from intact full-thickness biopsies of the ilium, representative of the axial skeleton. The results were related to the volumes of cortical and cancellous bone tissue separately and to the volume of the entire biopsy core. Approximately three-quarters of the patients had measurements in the appendicular skeleton by single photon absorptiometry of the radius and morphometry of the metacarpal. Disease effects did not differ significantly between ethnic groups. Mineralized cortical bone volume (per unit of core volume) was reduced by approximately 45% in both patient groups. Mineralized cancellous bone volume was significantly increased by 36% in the patients with OF and nonsignificantly reduced by 9% in the patients with OM; however, the reduction in the latter patients was significant in relation to tissue volume. The combined total deficit for both types of iliac bone was approximately 20% in the patients with OF and approximately 40% in the patients with OM. Significant reductions in appendicular cortical bone were demonstrated in both patient groups at both measurement sites. Regardless of the current histologic classification, the major structural abnormality in the skeleton is generalized thinning of cortical bone due to increased net endocortical resorption, the most characteristic effect on bone of hyperparathyroidism. Protection of the skeleton from the adverse consequences of renal failure will require therapeutic intervention in patients with no symptoms of either renal or bone disease.",

A reddish papule on her waist developed gradually into a nodule (1.9 x 1.4 cm). Histopathological findings showed that the tumor cells had oval to reniform nuclei; multinucleated neoplastic cells and erythrophagocytosis were also present. Immunohistochemical analyses revealed that the membranes of the tumor cells stained for Ber-H2 (Ki-1) and epithelial membrane antigen (EMA), Vimentin was partially positive, but keratin, S-100, chromogranin, leukocyte common antigen (LCA), UCHL-1, MT-1, L-26, MB-1 and C3D-1 were all negative. Anti-human T-cell leukemia virus-1 (HTLV-1) was also negative. No gene rearrangement of the T-cell receptors beta-, gamma- and delta-chain could be detected. From these results, we diagnosed cutaneous Ki-1 anaplastic large cell lymphoma (ALCL), but the origin could not be determined.

        "Abstract":"We undertook a retrospective study to determine the proportion of patients in whom diagnostic and therapeutic changes were made as a result of renal biopsy. From April 1992 to March 1997, 111 renal biopsies were performed on 109 children aged 11 months to 18 years at our hospital. Adequate renal tissue was obtained in 106 cases (95.3%). Gross hematuria was observed in 12 cases (10.8%). Perirenal hematoma was found in 8 cases (7.2%) by ultrasound. A scoring system was designed to assess if diagnosis and therapy are affected as a result of renal biopsy. For diagnosis, the score was 0 when no additional information was obtained; 1 when the diagnosis was confirmed or ruled out; and 2 when the diagnosis was changed after biopsy or the pathologic findings provided a definite prognosis. For therapy, the score was 0 when the management was not changed after biopsy; 1 when the clinical diagnosis was confirmed and yielded a change in management; and 2 when the diagnosis and management were changed after biopsy. We found the benefit score for diagnosis was 0 in 2 (1.9%) of the 106 biopsied cases; 1 in 78 (73.6%), and 2 in 26 (24.5%). The benefit score for therapy was 0 in 62 (58.5%); 1 in 24 (22.6%); and 2 in 20 (18.9%). Therapeutic change always occurred in the biopsied patients with steroid resistant nephrotic syndrome and systemic diseases with renal involvement, and occasionally occurred in frequent relapsing nephrotic syndrome, steroid dependent nephrotic syndrome and asymptomatic proteinuria plus hematuria. It never occurred in patients with acute or chronic renal failure and hematuria. We conclude that renal biopsy is a safe and efficient procedure in pediatric patients. It can markedly change diagnosis and therapy, and can increase the likelihood for a more rational management of children with renal disease.",

Minimal-change disease (MCD) accounted for 11.6%, focal and segmental sclerosis (FSG) 8.5%, mesangial proliferative GN (MPGN) 9.5%, membranoproliferative GN 5.5%, and thin-membrane disease 5%. Lupus nephritis was diagnosed in 5% and Alport's GN in 3.9% of the cases. The annual incidence of primary GN in Italian children was 11.1 cases per million children population (p.m.c.p.), IgAN accounting for 3.1 cases, MCD 2.3, and HSP nephritis 1.9 cases p.m.c.p. respectively. Italian children underwent renal biopsy because of isolated microscopic haematuria in 19.3% of the cases, non-nephrotic proteinuria with or without microscopic haematuria in 31.2%, and nephrotic-range proteinuria in 34.2%, less frequently (15.3%) because of acute or chronic renal failure. Children with persistent isolated microscopic haematuria had most frequently IgAN (34.9%) or thin-membrane disease (25.3%), while those with non-nephrotic proteinuria had IgAN (30.4%) and HSP nephritis (23%). In cases with nephrotic proteinuria renal biopsy showed MCD in 34.5% of the cases, FSG in 16.9%, and MPGN in 12.2%. When renal biopsy was performed in chronic renal failure, chronic interstitial renal disease was detected in 62.5% of the cases.\nCONCLUSIONS: This National Registry provides data on the indications for performing renal biopsy in Italian children and on the frequency and annual incidence of histological lesions detected. IgAN, primary or related to HSP, was the most common nephritis in Italian children undergoing renal biopsy.",

        "Abstract":"We reviewed 18 pediatric open renal biopsies performed because of renal insufficiency in patients with renal or renal and lower urinary tract (LUT) anomalies. Nine patients had LUT anomalies, 6 had small kidneys, and 3 had normal-sized, enlarged polycystic, and ectopic kidneys, respectively. Patients with LUT anomalies underwent biopsy at an earlier age and had a higher incidence of extrarenal anomalies. Seventeen biopsy specimens were abnormal: 15 showed focal forms of renal dysplasia, and 1 biopsy each showed glomerulocystic kidney disease and dominant polycystic kidney disease. The specimens with dysplasia also contained normal-looking nephrons, whose numbers were particularly striking in patients with a normal LUT. The biopsy specimen from the ectopic kidney was normal. Progressive renal disease developed in 12 of 17 patients with follow-up. All of them had either bilateral uncorrectable LUT abnormalities or bilateral small kidneys. This study demonstrates that renal biopsies in patients with renal insufficiency and gross abnormalities in kidneys or the LUT will often show evidence of parenchymal maldevelopment, principally focal forms of renal dysplasia Although normal nephrons are also present, and might even predominate, progressive disease should be anticipated in the presence of bilateral involvement because of the underlying developmental abnormality coupled with complications related to LUT disease and deficiency in renal mass.",

        "Abstract":"Isolated microscopic haematuria is a common finding in the genitourinary clinic. The conventional approach to investigation includes urological referral for cystourethroscopy if renal imaging is normal. However the diagnostic yield is very low; in particular urothelial malignancy at age < 40 years is rare. Glomerular disease is increasingly recognized as a common cause of microscopic haematuria. In this study 50 patients with persistent microscopic haematuria detected at a genitourinary clinic underwent renal biopsy. Twelve (24%) had an abnormal biopsy--IgA nephropathy 6 (12%), thin membrane nephropathy 3 (6%), other glomerulonephritis 3 (6%). In 7 others no abnormality was found but information was incomplete as electron microscopy was unavailable. It is important to establish these diagnoses since some patients will develop progressive renal disease. In this clinical setting renal biopsy will give diagnostic and prognostic information, protects from repeated urological investigation, and allows reassurance if renal histology is normal. Renal biopsy is recommended for patients age < 40 years with persistent microscopic haematuria. An algorithm for the investigation of microscopic haematuria is presented.",

        "Abstract":"OBJECTIVE: To investigate the prognosis of lupus nephritis (LN) and its influencing factors in patients with lupus nephritis in China.\nMETHODS: A retrospective study was carried out in 86 patients followed up for at least 5 years. Clinical features, serological and immunological tests were investigated. Renal biopsies were performed at the beginning of the study and repeated in some cases during the follow-up period. All the 86 patients had serum creatinine (Scr) level less than 132.6 mumol\/L at the initial presentation and were divided into three groups according to the level of Scr at the end of the study. Group I: the patients with normal renal function (Scr < 132.6 mumol\/L); Group II: the patients with mild-moderate renal insufficiency (132.6 mumol\/L < or = SCR < or = 530.4 mumol\/L); Group III: the patients with end stage renal failure (ESRF) (Scr > or = 530.4 mumol\/L).\nRESULTS: Forty-seven patients reached clinical remission with normal renal function, 11 had with stabilization of renal function, although the systemic lupus erythematosis (SLE) activity relapsed repeatedly, while 28 subjects developed renal insufficiency after 60-170 (mean 88.12 +\/- 28.23) months of observation. ESRF rate was 11.6% in this group of patients. Eight patients died (2 died of infections and 6 died of ESRF) during the follow-up period. At the beginning of the study the rates of hypertension, persistent anemia and hematuria in Group II were 50%, 70%, and 70% respectively, being much higher than those in Group I. The calculation of AI and CI in 60 patients revealed that there were 65% of patients with AI > or = 7 and 70% of patients with CI > or = 3 in Groups II and III, while in Group I there were only 32% of patients with AI > or = 7 and 19% of patients with CI > or = 3. Sixteen cases had pathologic class changed in 48 repeated biopsies. Seven cases changed to Class IV, 5 to Class II, 3 to Class V from other classes and one to class III from Class II.\nCONCLUSIONS: Factors associated with the development of renal insufficiency in these lupus patients included hypertension, anemia and hematuria. Renal biopsy evaluation offered additional prognostic information and showed that patients with severe active and chronic histologic changes were at risk for developing renal insufficiency. During the clinical course, the renal classification of LN changed in certain patients, thus the histologic classification of renal morphology at initial presentation did not fully predict the outcome. Renal involvement is very common in systemic lupus erythematosis (SLE) patients. Lupus nephritis (LN) is the most common form of secondary renal disease in China. It has various and unpredictable clinical features. The risks associated with its treatment have challenged investigators to detect the factors which may influence the survival rate of patients with LN and to develop the rational approaches to therapy. Decades of intensive investigation at many centers around the world had underscored the predictive value of demographic, clinical and laboratory data prior to treatment. Controversies still existed due to the difference in environment, race and the selection criteria of patients as well as the method used to evaluate the outcome. There are still some factors which are thought to have an impact on the prognosis of LN. Most of the articles on the prognosis of patients with LN were reported from Europe and America either about Caucasian or African-American patients. The prognosis of LN and its influence in Chinese patients need more elucidation.",

        "Abstract":"PURPOSE: This report describes data collected by the Italian Registry of Renal Biopsies (IRRB) (E mail http:\/\/www.teseo.it\/nephrology\/irrb), which includes 15461 renal biopsies (RB) performed over a period of 7 years (1987-1993).\nMETHODS: From 1987 to 1988, the Registry recorded only the histological diagnosis of 3686 RB, whereas beginning in 1989, additional records (sex, age, clinical symptoms and renal function) were obtained from 11,775 patients undergoing RB. This is the first report on such a large number of RB containing data from 96% of Italian renal units which routinely perform RB.\nRESULTS: In 13,835 RB performed in native kidneys, two groups of renal diseases, primary (59.9%) and secondary (25.4%) glomerulonephritis (gn), were more frequent than others. Among primary gn, the frequency of cases of IgAN, membranous gn, and focal and segmental glomerulosclerosis were 36.9, 21.7 and 10.4% respectively. Renal disease due to immune-mediated causes (51%) and dysgammaglobulinaemia (26.9%) were the most frequent among secondary gn. In the former group, the frequency of cases with lupus nephritis and vasculitis were 51.6 and 25.9% respectively. Renal amyloidosis (39.3%), essential mixed cryoglobulinaemia (30.9%), and multiple myeloma were the most frequent forms in the latter group. In 1993 the incidence of the following groups of renal disease was: primary gn (22.7 p.m.p.), secondary gn (11.1 p.m.p.) of which immune-mediated gn (5.8 p.m.p.), dysgammaglobulinaemias associated with nephritis (2.4 p.m.p.). IgAN and membranous gn, as primary gn, had an incidence of 8.4 and 4.9 p.m.p, respectively, while lupus nephritis (2.6 p.m.p.) and renal vasculitis (1.6 p.m.p.) were the most frequent forms of secondary gn. Clinical data regarding 10357 RB collected during 5 years (1989-1993), showed that the most common indications to perform RB were urinary abnormalities (30.8%) and nephrotic syndrome (27.1%), followed by recurrent episodes of macrohaematuria (8.7%) and nephritic syndrome (5.4%). Acute renal failure was present in 9.2% of patients and chronic renal insufficiency in 18.8% of cases. Membranous gn (32.9%), focal and segmental glomerulosclerosis (12.3%), and minimal-change disease (12.0%) were the most frequent diagnoses in patients with nephrotic syndrome, while post-streptococcal gn (16.1%) and IgAN (14.0%) were frequent in the nephritic syndrome. IgAN was frequently found in patients with urinary abnormalities (29.8%) and recurrent episodes of macrohematuria (71.4%). Twenty per cent of the acute renal insufficiency cases were secondary to necrotizing vasculitis, while chronic renal failure was present in 16.6% of the IgAN patients.\nFUTURE TRENDS: The IRRB is considering to extend its programme to include (i) paediatric section regarding RB from patients aged less than 18 years; (ii) annual review of clinical data concerning the kidney function of selected groups of patients recorded in IRRB, and (iii) the listing of IRRB records on the INTERNET, to facilitate the distribution of information throughout the scientific community.",

        "Abstract":"Osteoblasts have traditionally been considered to be terminally differentiated cells and therefore unable to divide. Data in recent years, however, indicate that cellular differentiation does not usually preclude preservation of proliferative ability and that most differentiated cells are able to divide under adequate stimuli. The aim of this study was to assess whether cubic osteoblasts undergo proliferation during the formation phase of the remodeling cycle under a stimulus that increased bone turnover. For that purpose, the osteoblastic proliferation index (OPI) was analyzed by DNA image cytometry in transiliac bone biopsies from 33 patients with chronic renal failure (23 men, 10 women; mean age 50.4 +\/- 15.1 years) who have been classified into low (n = 13), normal (n = 15), and high (n = 15) bone turnover according to activation frequency (Ac.f). OPI was significantly higher (p < 0.002) in the high bone turnover group (13.90 +\/- 4.72%) compared with the low (2.38 +\/- 4.13%) and normal turnover groups (2.84 +\/- 4.04%). There was a positive correlation between OPI and the following histomorphometric parameters: bone formation rate, surface referent (r = 0.76, p = 0.00001), activation frequency (r = 0.73, p = 0.00001), mineral apposition rate (r = 0.73, p = 0.00001), bone formation rate, volume referent (r = 0.71, p = 0.00001), and mineralizing surface (r = 0.62, p = 0.0001). This study shows that a rise in bone turnover is associated with a marked increase of bone-forming cell proliferation in patients with end-stage chronic renal failure. From this finding, it may be concluded that cubic osteoblasts do not behave as \"terminally differentiated\" cells in vivo, because a high proportion of them are still able to divide.",

There were 30 cases of interstitial nephritis, of whom 17 were Indian. In 15 of the Indian patients no aetiology could be established. The clinical features, outcomes, and the effect of steroid therapy in the Indian patients with idiopathic interstitial nephritis are described.\nCONCLUSION: Idiopathic interstitial nephritis is associated with Indian racial origin.

        "Published":null,
        "Abstract":"CD44 is a transmembrane proteoglycan that serves as a cell adhesion receptor and is involved in cell-cell and cell-matrix interactions, both key events in the pathogenesis of clinical and experimental glomerulonephritis. In addition, recent evidence suggests that the binding of cytokines to proteoglycans could regulate cytokine function. We have, therefore, studied the expression of CD44 by mesangial cells in culture and in experimental (Thy 1.1 model) and human glomerulonephritis. Mesangial expression of CD44 detected by immunohistochemistry was markedly increased four days after induction of the Thy 1.1 model, coinciding with the peak of mesangial cell proliferation and macrophage infiltration. Analysis of 92 human renal biopsies by immunohistochemistry showed that CD44 expression by infiltrating cells within the glomerulus, in focal interstitial infiltrates and within the interstitium (interstitial fibroblasts, and extracellular matrix), was significantly increased in biopsies with a greater degree of histological damage. There was, however, no increase in mesangial staining in diseased kidneys as compared with control sections. In contrast, cultured human mesangial cells expressed CD44 strongly when assayed by immunohistochemistry, immunoprecipitation and Northern blotting. CD44, therefore, is an example of a protein strongly expressed by mesangial cells in vitro and weakly or not at all in vivo, but which is up-regulated in a disease model. In human disease, however, little expression was detected within the glomerular mesangium, which may be related to the greater proliferation and more profound disruption of mesangial architecture seen in the Thy 1.1 model. CD44 expression by infiltrating cells and by components of the interstitium could, however, play an important role in the pathogenesis of chronic progressive renal disease in humans.",

In approximately 50% of the patients in this group, the indication for renal biposy is a nephrotic syndrome. The lesions usually observed involve extramembranous glomerulonephritis or minimal change glomerulopathy. The biopsy may also reveal amylosis. Chronic renal failure is the predominant reason for nephrology consultation in the elderly. Although all of these patients do not undergo biopsy, in our experience, results show chronic glomerulopathies, mainly IgA, in about half of the case as well as chronic interstitial nephritis and nephroangiosclerosis. The aging process also leads to acute renal failure in many patients. Biopsy would not be indicated in case of shock, drug toxicity or obstruction but in approximately 10% of the cases histology can reveal a specific parenchymal lesion. The technique for renal biopsy is the same in elderly patients as in younger adults. Renal biopsy can be considered as a safe diagnostic tool of considerable importance when ordered by a nephrologist, performed by an experienced operator and read by a well-trained pathologist. In many cases it is essential to in order to provide patients over 75 with the same quality care as younger adults.",

The course of some of these cases can be improved by appropriate therapeutic measures, if they are undertaken early. Early identification of these lesions is therefore mandatory. The clinical diagnosis is often difficult: 1. rare atypical forms of acute tubular necrosis, with renal or extrarenal signs, may lead to renal biopsy; 2. vascular and glomerular disease are most often recognized clinically (sometimes misdiagnosed), but the histological type (and therefore the appropriate treatment) cannot be determined; 3. acute interstitial nephritis is rarely diagnosed clinically and the nature of the infiltrate remains unknown. In certain cases of acute renal failure, the contribution of early renal biopsy to the etiological diagnosis and to prognosis and therapy is obvious. In acute renal failure, renal biopsy should be considered early in a rather limited number of patients (about 20%), everytime the diagnosis of tubular necrosis is doubtful, especially in acute renal failure associated with persistent infection, in order to guide the therapy.",

The mean age of onset was 26.2 years, and the mean follow-up duration was 11.7 years. Biopsies (n = 142) performed on 107 patients showed the following World Health Organization (WHO) class distribution: class I, n = 1; class II, n = 13; class III, n = 19; class IV, n = 69; class V, n = 17; class VI, n = 8; and class not determinable, n = 15. Ninety-five patients were nephrotic. Therapeutic intervention courses given to all patients (n = 356) included parenteral (IV) cyclophosphamide (n = 58), high-dose oral steroids (n = 126), pulse steroids (n = 49), apheresis (n = 39), azathioprine (n = 43), oral cyclophosphamide (n = 5), nitrogen mustard (n = 27), and chlorambucil (n = 6). In addition to examining the course of disease for various subsets, various predictors for fatality and end-stage renal disease (ESRD) were analyzed. Descriptive data for the short-term response to five therapies are provided for the complete patient sample, proliferative disease, and nephrotic syndrome.

Prior development and use of the cystoscopically guided pancreatic allograft biopsy have allowed for more accurate and timely diagnosis of pancreatic allograft dysfunction, possibly contributing to our 1-year pancreas graft, renal allograft and patient survival rates of 87.1%, 88.5% and 96.8%, respectively. We reviewed our experience, examining efficacy and complication rates of pancreas and kidney biopsies in 31 cadaveric pancreas or combined kidney and pancreas transplants performed between June 1990 and February 1992 with at least 1 year of followup. There were 94 pancreas, 54 kidney and 53 duodenal mucosal biopsies in 29 evaluable patients. This biopsy technique uses a 24.5F side-viewing nephroscope to view the cystoduodenostomy, with the duodenum acting as a portal for biopsy needles into the pancreas. Pancreatic tissue is obtained with either an 18 gauge, 500 mm. Menghini aspiration\/core needle or an 18 gauge, 500 mm. Roth core needle. Percutaneous renal allograft biopsies are performed independently or simultaneously with the pancreas biopsies using a 16 gauge spring loaded needle. Pancreas biopsies were prompted by clinical indications of rejection (decreased urinary amylase, increased serum amylase or increased serum creatinine) or by protocol (10, 21 and 40 days postoperatively). Among the biopsies 30% were required by protocol, of which 10 (36%) revealed abnormal pathological findings and 5 (18%) showed evidence of occult cellular rejection. Renal biopsies demonstrated rejection in 69% of the cases. Of simultaneous pancreas\/kidney biopsies 33% revealed concomitant rejection. A total of 88 Menghini needles with 170 passes was used in 73 biopsy attempts, yielding 126 tissue cores with a 16% complication rate. A total of 41 Roth needles was used with 73 passes in 34 biopsy attempts, yielding 55 tissue cores with a complication rate of 21%. Complications included self-limited bleeding from the biopsy site in 13% of the cases, bleeding requiring clot evacuation and fulguration in 1% and asymptomatic hyperamylasemia in 12%. Renal biopsy complications included 1 arteriovenous fistula (2%). We conclude that ultrasound and cystoscopically guided pancreatic allograft biopsy and percutaneous renal allograft biopsies are safe and essential methods of obtaining tissue for histological diagnosis without serious sequelae. The Menghini and Roth needles in cystoscopically guided pancreatic allograft biopsy have similar yield and complication rates in obtaining pancreatic tissue, although they require different performance techniques. In some cases both needles are necessary and are complementary in obtaining adequate tissue.(ABSTRACT TRUNCATED AT 400 WORDS)",

We have utilized this technique to demonstrate the strong, likely causal, relationship between gamma-interferon and acute rejection.

Most postbiopsy AVF are asymptomatic and close spontaneously. Conversely, AVF may enlarge and become symptomatic, requiring embolization to reverse or prevent complications. A case of renal insufficiency in a renal transplant recipient due to a postbiopsy AVF is presented. Spontaneous closure of the AVF resulted in the resolution of renal insufficiency.

        "Abstract":"Animal studies show that the renin-angiotensin system contributes to hypertension, glomerulosclerosis and progressive chronic renal failure in renal disease. Direct data on the activity of the renal renin-angiotensin system (RAS) in human renal disease are scarce, however. The small amount of tissue in renal biopsies and insufficient sensitivity of analytical methods have precluded reliable measurements of the tissue components of the RAS in the past. Due to its highly sensitivity the quantitative polymerase chain reaction (QPCR) assay today allows the quantitation of gene transcription products in small tissue samples, for example, renal biopsies. The clinical applicability of the PCR has raised the interest in this methodology. We adopted quantitative PCR to study expression and regulation of the renin gene in patients with different forms of glomerulonephritis. For PCR a deletion mutant of the renin gene was used as an internal standard exhibiting the same primer binding sites as the human gene. The number of glomeruli per biopsy sample was counted by microscopic transillumination immediately after biopsy and was used as a reference base. Renin mRNA was expressed as fg per glomerulus. Compared to nonaffected tissue of tumor nephrectomy samples, renin gene expression was significantly lower in glomerulonephritic patients without converting enzyme inhibitor (CEI) treatment, that is, 63 +\/- 20 (6) versus 250 +\/- 50 (7) (P < 0.02), although plasma renin concentration was in the normal range. Significantly higher renin mRNA expression was found in patients with glomerulonephritis treated with CEI, that is, 210 +\/- 50 (8) versus 63 +\/- 20 (6) in patients not treated.(ABSTRACT TRUNCATED AT 250 WORDS)",

The two methods combined had 87% sensitivity in all. In the authors' experience, US proved to be a sensitive, accurate and cost-effective technique, as well as the best method to guide biopsy thanks to its multiplanar capabilities. Even though it requires great operator's experience, US is the method of choice in the localization of abnormal parathyroid glands. Its combination with CT increased overall sensitivity mainly in ectopic localizations and postoperative recurrences. Finally, technologic progress and increased MR sensitivity are likely to make MRI the imaging technique of choice, replacing CT, in the diagnostic protocol of hyperparathyroidism.",

A length of 9 cm or less measured ultrasonographically is considered to indicate irreversible disease. However, some patients with normal renal length have thin parenchyma. The aim of this study was to determine the relationship between ultrasonographically measured parenchymal thickness and renal length and to correlate parenchymal thickness with the histology obtained at renal biopsy. Sixty-four patients, aged 16-74 years, who had had a renal biopsy were evaluated retrospectively. Histology was considered in five categories: I, interstitial nephritis (n = 13); II, glomerulonephritis (28); III, diabetes mellitus\/metabolic\/other (8); IV, chronic renal disease (CRD) (11); V, hypertension\/vascular disease (4). There was a good linear correlation between renal length and renal parenchymal thickness (r = 0.64, P < 0.001). Both were reduced most in patients with CRD. Sixty-four per cent of patients with CRD had renal parenchymal thickness 1.5 cm or less, compared to 38% in group I, 25% in groups II and V, and 7% in group II. Although 11\/37 (30%) of patients whose serum creatinine had increased 3 months post-biopsy had parenchymal thickness 1.5 cm or less, so did 6\/27 (23%) whose creatinine decreased. Like renal length, parenchymal thickness gives an indication of the chronicity of renal failure. However, some patients with parenchymal thickness 1.5 cm or less still have potential for improvement. This measurement alone should not be used to obviate renal biopsy.",

Patients with renal insufficiency accompanied by elevated blood pressure, hypertensive target organ damage (retinal disease and left-ventricular hypertrophy) and mild proteinuria are typically labelled as having hypertensive nephrosclerosis in the absence of renal biopsy material. Herein, we report the clinical summaries and renal pathology from 2 patients initially diagnosed with hypertensive nephrosclerosis. Glomeruli exhibiting focal and segmental sclerosis and interstitial scarring were present in both cases. The presence of primary renal disease in patients felt to have hypertensive nephrosclerosis is likely more common than currently appreciated. This may result from the lack of renal histologic material and the late presentation of these patients to nephrologists. Misclassification of hypertensive nephrosclerosis would impact greatly on the epidemiology of end-stage renal disease and the evaluation and treatment of patients with chronic renal insufficiency.",

        "Abstract":"Up to the present the histological diagnosis of rejection through biopsy is still the only possibility for a definite rejection diagnosis. We searched for a reliable non-invasive marker of renal graft rejection. By means of a highly sensitive enzyme-linked immunosorbent assay we investigated the changes in the concentration of serum soluble TNF receptor in kidney graft recipients with different clinical courses according to their graft tolerance. sTNF-R in 19 patients with stable graft function (5.3 +\/- 3.2 ng\/ml) did not differ significantly from those detected in 22 healty volunteers (4.1 +\/- 2.2 ng\/ml). In contrast 17 patients suffering from acute graft rejection showed highly significantly increases (23 +\/- 8.3 ng\/ml, P < 0.0001). These elevated concentrations returned to prerejection rejection values after a 3-day anti-rejection therapy with high-dose methylprednisolone. In 18 patients with an irreversible, chronic kidney graft rejection we could demonstrate significantly increased sTNF-R values (20 +\/- 7.9 ng\/ml); eight of those patients did not reflect on the anti-rejection therapy, so that the elevated concentrations remained even after the administration of high-dose corticosteroids and ATG. Additionally we found soluble TNF receptor concentrations to be increased earlier than other commonly used biochemical parameters such as creatinine. Soluble TNF-R also proved to be useful for the differentiation of cyclosporin nephrotoxicity. Therefore we believe that the soluble TNF-R and its concentration course may be of diagnostic and prognostic value in kidney graft rejection, as it supports the diagnosis of transplant rejection, indicates the rejection event very early, and reflects the response to anti-rejection therapy.",

In order to determine the usefulness of hepatic cytology in the diagnosis of liver disease, the findings of hepatic needle core biopsy (NCB) and fine needle aspirative biopsy (FNAB) were compared in 15 HBsAg-positive uremic patients. The patients, aged 42 +\/- 12 years, 14 males, were on hemodialysis for periods ranging from 13 to 105 months. The NCB was processed by standard histologic and immunohistochemical techniques and FNAB by the conventional technique, using the total corrected increment score (TCI). Plasma samples were collected for evaluation of hepatic function and for viral serologic tests. In 15 patients a diagnosis was made by NCB: normal, 7 cases; chronic persistent hepatitis, 4 cases; and chronic active hepatitis, 4 cases. When the patients were allocated into two groups according to the severity of the liver histologic findings [group I--minor changes (normal+chronic persistent hepatitis), 11 patients; group II--major changes (chronic active hepatitis), 4 patients], statistically higher values were found in the major changes group for alanine aminotransferase (49 +\/- 33 vs. 24 +\/- 11, p = 0.04), gamma-glutamyl transpeptidase [148 +\/- 53 vs. 38 +\/- 28, p < (minor) 0.02] and TCI (3.7 +\/- 1.2 vs. 2.5 +\/- 0.8, p = 0.04). In conclusion, liver FNAB can be useful as a screening procedure for the identification of liver histologic changes (minor or major) in uremic HBsAG-positive patients.",

At the end of the follow-up 8 patients (18.2%) had had no urinary anomalies for at least 1 year (stage A disease), 28 (63.6%) had microscopic hematuria with proteinuria < 1 g\/m2\/day (stage B), 5 (11.4%) had proteinuria > 1 g\/m2\/day (stage C), and 3 (6.8%) had chronic renal insufficiency (stage D). None of the patients in apparent remission presented with elevated serum IgA levels at disease onset. Gross or microscopic hematuria at onset correlated with stage A\/B disease at the end of follow-up (p < .05) whereas the presence of proteinuria or nephritic syndrome at onset correlated with stage C\/D disease after follow-up (p > .05). Presenting features of gross or microscopic hematuria without or with proteinuria (< 0.5 g\/m2\/day) correlated (p < .001) with minimal glomerular abnormalities at biopsy, whereas patients with nephritic syndrome had more severe histologic pictures. The presence of proliferative glomerulonephritis with crescents correlated (p < .0001) with poor outcome. The results demonstrate that the prognosis of IgA nephropathy in childhood must be viewed with caution and that outcome correlates with mode of onset and severity of the renal pathology.",

        "Abstract":"There is great debate as to whether the benefit gained from the knowledge of renal histology outweighs the risk to the patient from the biopsy procedure. We conducted a prospective study of 276 native renal biopsies performed on 266 patients from a single centre in 1991 to assess the effect of the knowledge of renal histology on patient management. Biopsies were performed under ultrasound guidance using the Trucut biopsy needle. The indications for biopsy were: non-nephrotic proteinuria alone (25), haematuria and proteinuria (28), nephrotic range proteinuria (28), acute renal failure (31), haematuria alone (36), and chronic renal failure (128). Two hundred and sixty-three biopsies were successful. The mean number of glomeruli obtained was 23, range 0-115. Eight patients developed macroscopic haematuria of which two required blood transfusion. The result of the biopsy altered management in 24\/28 (86%) of cases of nephrotic range proteinuria, 22\/31 (71%) of cases of acute renal failure, 58\/128 (45%) of cases of chronic renal failure, 9\/28 (32%) of cases with haematuria and proteinuria, 3\/25 (12%) of cases with non-nephrotic proteinuria alone, and 1\/36 (3%) of cases with haematuria alone. management was altered in 42% of cases overall. These data suggest that knowledge of renal histology is essential in the management of patients with renal disease.",

        "Abstract":"Of an inception cohort of 87 patients with lupus nephritis who underwent a renal biopsy, 42 underwent second biopsies a median of 25 months later. From first to second biopsy, focal and diffuse proliferative nephritis (World Health Organization classes III and IV) became less frequent, and mesangial hypercellularity (class II) and a membranous pattern (class V) increased. The National Institutes of Health activity index and mesangial and subendothelial deposits declined while the chronicity index, a tubulointerstitial index, and subepithelial deposits increased. The biopsy improvement in urinary protein excretion was best explained by decreases in the activity index score and the amount of subendothelial deposits. A decrease in the amount of subendothelial deposits tended to predict an improvement in the serum creatinine level from first to second biopsy. With follow-up from second biopsy in excess of 7 years, the best predictors of long-term outcome were the ultrastructural variables mesangial, subendothelial and subepithelial deposits. When the change in biopsy predictors from first to second biopsy was evaluated, a decrease in the amount of mesangial or subendothelial deposits was best at predicting a lower risk of renal impairment, renal insufficiency, and mortality. The results confirm the importance of immune complex deposition as measured by electron microscopy in the pathogenesis of lupus nephritis and suggest that control of this process may alter renal function and prognosis.",

A histopathological examination is essential to achieve a definite diagnosis in systemic amyloidosis. The diagnostic yield of the procedure varies according to the biopsy site and renal biopsy has the highest yield. On the other hand this procedure has its own complications and requires hospitalization of the patient. Alternative biopsy sites have been proposed with varying degrees of sensitivity and morbidity to reduce the morbidity and mortality of solid organ biopsies. We performed bone marrow biopsies in 39 patients with FMF who had different stages of renal disease. Thirty-one (79.5%) of the 39 specimens showed significant perivascular amyloid infiltration when stained with crystal violet and Congo red. An immunoperoxidase stain with a monoclonal antibody proved that these deposits were AA type amyloid. We suggest that bone marrow biopsy can be utilized for a safe and quick diagnosis of systemic amyloidosis in patients with FMF and renal disease.",

Significant complications occurred in only four patients. In 170 patients (83%) the biopsy yielded information of diagnostic and prognostic value and influenced management. The main indications for biopsy were nephrotic syndrome, in 63 patients, and chronic renal failure, in 58 patients. The most frequent findings were minimal change disease, focal segmental glomerulosclerosis, IgA nephropathy, membranous glomerulonephritis and mesangiocapillary glomerulonephritis. The most obvious association between indication and histology was between haematuria and IgA nephropathy. Percutaneous renal biopsy in the district general hospital in patients selected by a nephrologist and performed by experienced or supervised operators is a safe procedure.

The long-standing alterations in mineral metabolism generated by renal failure have a profound effect on the skeleton and induce severe systemic metabolic bone disease. Iliac crest biopsy was performed in 51 patients of chronic renal failure and examined with microscopy. The histological bone changes are characterized by ostitis fibrosa, increased resorption of bone and number of osteoclasts, increased osteoid volume (osteoblastic osteoid and acellular osteoid), active remodelling of bone and aluminum deposition in bone. According to the histological appearance, advanced renal bone disease can be subdivided into three major histological groups: secondly hyperparathyroid bone disease (high turnover uremic osteodystrophy), osteomalacia (low turnover uremic osteodystrophy) and mixed uremic osteodystrophy consisting of mild to moderate hyperparathyroid bone disease and defective mineralization. Aluminum-related bone changes can be seen in varying degrees in all these groups. Even though these groups do not fully represent separate entities and transformation from one form to another can occur, it is essential to distinguish them since therapy can be tailored according to the predominant histologic findings.",

Previous reports have shown that treatment with 24,25-dihydroxy vitamin D3 (24,25(OH)2D3) may result in decreased bone resorption. The present study addresses basic mechanisms for the action of 24,25(OH)2D3 in bone of patients with elevated serum parathyroid hormone (PTH) levels due to chronic renal disease. Twenty-four patients 56 +\/- 17 years old (mean +\/- SE) with chronic kidney disease in the predialytic state (serum creatinine > 150 mumol\/l) and elevated serum midregion PTH > 1.2 micrograms\/l were randomly assigned to oral treatment with either 1,25-dihydroxy vitamin D3 (1,25(OH)2D3) (0.25-0.50 microgram\/day), 24,25(OH)2D3 (daily dose of 15 micrograms), or a combination of the two vitamin D3 analogs. The control group received calcium carbonate (maximal dosage of 1 g x 3). Selected variables in serum and urine as well as hormone sensitive adenylate cyclase (AC) in iliac crest biopsies were assessed before treatment and during follow-up after two and six months. Serum levels of 1,25(OH)2D3 and 24,25(OH)2D3 were significantly (P < 0.05) increased after two and six months in the respective treatment groups. Net bone PTH-enhanced AC (PTH-AC) fell abruptly (P < 0.01) after two months of treatment and was nearly abolished (P < 0.01) after six months with 24,25(OH)2D3 given alone or in combination with 1,25(OH)2D3. An inverse relationship (r = -0.57, P < 0.05, n = 48) between net PTH-AC in bone and serum levels of 24,25(OH)2D3 was demonstrated. In all groups, serum total calcium (s-Ca) was maintained within normal range.(ABSTRACT TRUNCATED AT 250 WORDS)",

This study was performed to determine if this approach preserves renal mass and function when compared with initial surgical resection followed by chemotherapy. Over a 20-year period (1970 to 1990), 15 patients with synchronous bilateral Wilms' tumor were treated at the Childrens Hospital of Los Angeles. Eight patients in the surgical group underwent initial unilateral nephrectomy with contralateral biopsy, wedge resection, or partial nephrectomy and subsequent chemotherapy. The seven patients in the chemotherapy group underwent bilateral tumor biopsy, followed by chemotherapy and subsequent tumor resection. Patients were assigned to each group in a nonrandomized manner according to the preference of the attending oncologist and surgeon. Comparison of the two groups showed no significant differences in sex distribution, initial renal function, tumor histology, dose and field of radiotherapy, presence or absence of positive surgical margins, and local recurrence rates. Patients in the surgery group were slightly older than those in the chemotherapy group: 3.6 +\/- 2.2 versus 2.3 +\/- 2.2 years. The percent of renal mass involved by tumor for the surgery group was 52 +\/- 12 versus 73 +\/- 16 for the chemotherapy group (P = .03). The percent of renal mass preserved following all operations, local recurrence rates, incidence of metastases, and survival was nearly identical between the two groups.

        "Abstract":"BACKGROUND: Acute and chronic renal allograft rejection injuries involve, albeit variably, all compartments of the organ and are associated with significant structural changes. We hoped to gain new insights into these phenomena by determining distribution of certain extracellular matrix proteins known to be involved in architectural remodeling processes.\nEXPERIMENTAL DESIGN: Frozen tissue samples from biopsies of acute (n = 14) and chronic (n = 12) human renal allograft rejections were studied to compare distribution of tenascin, the extradomains A and B (EDA, EDB), and oncofetal (Onc) isoforms of cellular fibronectin (cFn). Normal kidneys (n = 4) served as controls. Cryosections were immunostained by the avidin-biotin-complex method with monoclonal antibodies specific for those molecules.\nRESULTS: In acute rejection, reactivity for tenascin and EDA-cFn was increased slightly to moderately in glomerular mesangia and in most vessels while it was intensely and diffusely increased in the interstitium. Rarely were focal EDB-cFn and Onc-cFn reactions seen in lesions deemed to reflect acute injury. In chronic rejection, tenascin and EDA-cFn were strongly increased in most glomerular mesangia and in vascular walls but unevenly in the interstitium. In rare glomerular synechiae and vessels, enhanced staining for tenascin and EDA-cFn as well as EDB-cFn and Onc-cFn was noted while in obsolete glomeruli only EDB-cFn and Onc-cFn were detected. The enhanced distribution of tenascin and EDA-cFn partly reflected that noted during nephrogenesis, whereas staining patterns for EDB-cFn and Onc-cFn differed from their fetal counterparts.\nCONCLUSIONS: Tenascin and EDA-cFn are strongly and preferentially expressed in the interstitial and vascular compartments of acute and chronic renal rejection injury suggesting that, in these sites, active repair and remodeling occur during both phases of the rejection process irrespective of the changes seen by conventional microscopy. Tenascin, EDA-cFn as well as EDB-cFn and Onc-cFn are all involved, albeit variably, in the glomerular and vascular alterations of chronic rejection. The finding of tenascin and of the three isoforms of cFn in glomerular synechiae with actively proliferating epithelium suggests that certain epithelial cells might partake in the synthesis of these molecules.",

The development of a post-transplant lymphoproliferative disorder is an infrequent complication of such therapy. FK 506 is a new immunosuppressant agent that has recently been used in patients receiving organ transplantation. This report describes a 20 month old Saudi child who developed post-transplant lymphoproliferative disorder while receiving FK 506 following liver transplantation. Such a complication has been recognized with cyclosporine but has not been well addressed as yet with FK 506. The child also developed progressive renal complications. There was also a difficulty in interpreting the results for IgM antibodies to different viruses. The overall features of progressive renal toxicity and those of lymphadenopathy, hepatosplenomegaly, fever, neutropenia and thrombocytopenia reversed following discontinuation of FK 506 therapy. It is concluded that all the above complications, though reversible, may well be linked to the new immunosuppressant agent FK 506.",

        "Abstract":"We retrospectively evaluated the clinical outcome of 45 female and 11 male patients with biopsy-proven lupus nephritis, followed at our hospital between February 1974 and February 1990. In the majority signs of nephritis were present at the time systemic lupus erythematosus was diagnosed (range: -42-156 months) and the median time from onset of nephritis to biopsy was 2 months. The median follow-up from the time of the biopsy was 53.5 months (range: 2-192), the median age at biopsy 25 years and the median serum creatinine level 1.2 mg\/dl. Initial renal biopsies had the following histopathological classes according to the World Health Organization criteria (n): I (2); II (10); III (10); IV (28); V (5); VI (1). Over the study period active episodes were treated with high-dose oral prednisone alone or combined with intravenous nitrogen mustard and oral chlorambucil (1974-75), azathioprine (1978-86), cyclophosphamide (1986-90) and\/or plasma-exchange (1976-84). These strategies were based on literature data or multicenter studies in which we participated. Eight patients developed end-stage renal disease (ESRD) (median: 47 months post-biopsy; range: 20-120). In these, initial biopsies showed class IV in seven, and class V in one. Confounded risk factors for ESRD were class IV biopsy, male gender and serum creatinine level above 1.4 mg\/dl. The calculated proportion without ESRD 5 years post-biopsy was 87% (95% confidence limits: 98-76%), and at 10 years 70% (95% confidence limits: 90-49%). Five patients (11.2%) died; causes of death were cerebrovascular accident (n = 2), cerebral lupus (n = 2) and S. aureus sepsis (n = 1).(ABSTRACT TRUNCATED AT 250 WORDS)",

        "Abstract":"Between November 1985 and November 1989, percutaneous renal biopsy was performed in 32 patients aged 75 or more (mean age 78). The major clinical presentations were nephrotic syndrome in 22 patients, variable amounts of proteinuria in 6 patients and unexplained severe renal insufficiency in 4 patients. In 27 cases the histological study revealed a glomerular disease. Minimal change disease (7 cases), membranous nephropathy (6 cases), amyloidosis (5 cases) and crescentic glomerulonephritis were the most frequent types. The rate of complications after biopsy was low (3 percent) with only one retroperitoneal hematoma. Owing to the atypical renal presentation of some glomerulopathies in the elderly, renal biopsy was useful to differentiate between minimal change disease, membranous nephropathy and amyloidosis. In 4 patients with minimal change disease, remission of nephrotic syndrome was obtained with corticosteroids. Moreover renal biopsy allowed to detect underlying diseases and gave indications to initiate specific therapy particularly in crescentic glomerulonephritis the outcome of which remained unfavourable. It is concluded that, even in elderly, renal biopsy is a valuable and safe diagnostic tool to obtain a rapid diagnosis, particularly in glomerular diseases, leading to a biopsy-guided therapy. It must therefore have the same indications as in younger adults with glomerular syndrome or rapidly progressive renal insufficiency.",

Renal insufficiency is common. Clinical and laboratory findings are nonspecific. Diagnosis is based primarily on histologic examination of the liver. The cause of AFLP is unknown. The illness has been associated with a high maternal and fetal mortality; with increased awareness and more liberal use of liver biopsy, however, milder forms of the disease are now recognized. Some speculate that AFLP is part of the spectrum of preeclampsia. Liver histology shows microvesicular fat and little or no inflammation or hepatocellular necrosis. Treatment consists of expeditious delivery and maximal supportive care, which may include intensive care unit monitoring, blood component therapy, glucose infusion, sodium restriction, diuretic agents, mechanical ventilation, and dialysis. The role of hepatic transplantation in AFLP appears limited. The risk of mortality during AFLP must be compared with the short- and long-term morbidity and mortality associated with liver transplantation.",

Pancreas transplants have not been biopsed percutaneously, though open and percystoscopic biopsies have proved useful. We have compared percutaneous needle core biopsy with fine-needle aspiration cytology for the diagnosis of rejection in 18 patients receiving combined kidney and pancreas transplants and in one who was transplanted with the pancreas alone. Percutaneous needle core biopsy was successful in 37 of 40 attempts (93%), while fine-needle aspiration yielded diagnostic material on 33 of 47 attempts (70%). Transient hyperamylasemia occurred in 29%, returning to baseline in three days. One patient twice developed transient macroscopic hematuria. There was agreement between needle core biopsy and fine-needle aspiration on the diagnosis of rejection on six occasions and for the absence of rejection on 16. There was an 8% false-positive rate for fine-needle aspiration. In 13 instances of histologically proved renal rejection, concurrent pancreas biopsy revealed rejection in 69%. Pancreas rejection was not, however, seen in the absence of renal rejection. In this pilot study, percutaneous biopsy of the bladder-drained pancreas allograft was shown to be a practicable and valuable investigation without major complications.",

Mesangial expansion and capillary wall thickening were accompanied by numerous extracellular osmiophilic membranes within round lucent spaces, by round lamellar deposits, and by amorphous deposits containing thread-like structures with cross-striations. A second biopsy in one of the brothers, when he had developed renal insufficiency 8 yr later, showed increased mesangial and capillary wall thickening. The deposits, which had been in predominantly subepithelial and intramembranous locations, were now in a more prominent subendothelial location. The subepithelial localization of the deposits seen on initial examination may be related to their cationic charge, perhaps with binding to glomerular polyanion, and to uptake by glomerular epithelial cells. The accumulation of lipid is associated with progressive mesangial and glomerular sclerosis.",

The aim of the present study was to evaluate the prevalence of the different forms of ROD.\nMETHODS: Nondecalcified bone biopsies were evaluated in 100 patients with end-stage renal disease (57 in pre-dialysis and 43 on hemodialysis) in whom biochemical (calcium, phosphorus, alkaline phosphatase, parathyroid hormone) and histomorphometric studies were carried out. Bone biopsies were classified in four histological groups: mild, fibrous osteitis (FO), osteomalacia (OM) and mixed type (FO + OM).\nRESULTS: 96% of patients had histological findings of ROD with the following distribution: 41% mild; 30% FO; 14% OM; and 11% mixed. The most advanced types of ROD were seen in interstitial renal diseases. Pre-dialysis OM was associated with metabolic acidosis, a low phosphocalcic product and relative hypophosphoremia. Chronic aluminium poisoning was uncommon (7%) and was basically associated with OM. No instance of aluminium poisoning with osteodystrophy and bone fractures was seen.\nCONCLUSIONS: The most severe histological forms of OM were found in hemodialysis patients with persistent hypophosphoremia and associated with osteosclerosis.",

Two hundred biopsies performed between June 1983 and January 1990 were reviewed retrospectively. Nephrology fellows performed 83.5% of the biopsies. The average age of the patients was 43 +\/- 17 years (range 6-80) and renal insufficiency (serum creatinine greater than or equal to 1.3 mg, %) was present in approximately 60% of patients biopsied. Primary indications for biopsy were to evaluate proteinuria (46.5%) and renal manifestation of systemic lupus erythematosus (24%). Material for light microscopy, immunofluorescence, and electron microscopy was obtained in 99.5, 95.0 and 98.0% of cases, respectively. Adequate tissue for histologic diagnosis was obtained in 97.5% of patients. Primary diagnosis was glomerulonephritis in 77.9% of cases. Complications were assessed and separated by severity. Total complications were observed in 13.7% of patients with 8.1% of these being minor complications (not requiring blood transfusion) and 5.6% being major complications which required blood transfusions. Bleeding complications requiring massive blood transfusion and\/or therapeutic radiologic intervention were seen in 1.5% of patients. We could find no significant difference with respect to age, serum creatinine, or coagulation parameters between patients with or without complications due to percutaneous renal biopsy. We conclude that real-time ultrasound is a safe, accurate method in localizing the kidney for percutaneous renal biopsy. However, patients must still be observed carefully post biopsy for potential complications.",

The GFR decreased significantly, but the decline was essentially dependent on increasing age, except in two patients who had developed renal insufficiency.

        "Abstract":"Diabetic nephropathy is the single most important cause of end-stage renal disease (ESRD) in the United States. Further, the increased risk of mortality from type I diabetes is almost entirely confined to patients developing clinical diabetic nephropathy. Nonetheless, kidney biopsy has had little role in the clinical assessment of diabetic patients or in the design of clinical research in diabetic nephropathy. The development of dipstick-positive proteinuria in patients with type I diabetes of more than 10 years' duration is regularly associated with advanced structural changes of diabetic nephropathology; in these patients, clinical parameters, especially the rate of decline of glomerular filtration rate (GFR), are accurate monitors of disease progression. Microalbuminuria indicates a very high risk of overt proteinuria and thus ESRD. This increased risk is associated with levels of urinary albumin excretion (UAE; greater than 30 micrograms\/min [45 mg\/24 h]), which are frequently accompanied by hypertension and reduced or decreasing GFR. At this stage, lesions of diabetic nephropathy are usually already well established. Thus, microalbuminuria is more a marker of early nephropathy than a predictor of later renal injury. Before these clinical stages of nephropathy, there are no accurate predictors of renal risk. Renal biopsy may serve this role by indicating those patients who are developing significant lesions during the \"silent\" phase of the disease. In large measure, this value of the biopsy derives from evidence that the lesions tend to develop linearly over time and can be measured by techniques that are relatively easily established in standard surgical pathology environments. Renal biopsies can serve to assure the majority of diabetic patients that they are developing serious lesions slowly, if at all.(ABSTRACT TRUNCATED AT 250 WORDS)",

For all biopsies (RB1 and RB2), we developed a quantitative scoring for all elementary lesions with a glomerular, an interstitial, a tubular and a vascular index. The sum of these 4 indexes gave a global optical score (GOS). Pathological improvement on light microscopy (delta GOS less than or equal to -2) was noticed only in 3 patients (4%), stability (-2 less than delta GOS less than +2) in 30 patients (41%), mild deterioration (+2 less than or equal to GOS less than 5) in 23 patients (32%) and major progression (delta GOS greater than or equal to 5) in 17 patients (23%). We observed no pathological remission, even in the 14 patients with complete clinical remission. The pathological progression was characterized by an increase in all elementary lesions, mainly the tubulo-interstitial and vascular ones. By immunofluorescence mesangial IgA deposits remained stable with no disappearance; however, the number and intensity of vascular C3 deposits were significantly greater on RB2. Chronic renal failure (serum creatinine greater than 1.5 mg\/dl) correlated best with major pathological progression and mainly with the progression of extraglomerular lesions. IgA nephritis is a slowly progressive disease with no pathological remission, and its evolution is characterized by progression of extraglomerular lesions, mainly vascular, which might play a major role in the ultimate development of chronic renal failure.",

Tissue diagnoses were glomerulopathy (n = 252, 75.4%), acute tubular lesions (n = 18), interstitial nephritis (n = 23), vascular diseases (n = 36, including 14 with cholesterol emboli), and five miscellaneous diagnoses. Of the 55 patients with ARF, 23 had a glomerular lesion, 15 had acute tubular necrosis, and 8 had acute interstitial nephritis. Of 72 patients with SRF, 49 had a glomerulopathy, 12 had a vascular disorder, and six had acute interstitial nephritis. Hence, patients with ARF or SRF exhibited a high potential for reversible lesions. Only 11.3% of patients with CRF had potentially reversible causes. The most common causes of proteinuria were membranous glomerulopathy (34.3%), minimal change disease (14.6%), focal segmental sclerosis (11.7%), and amyloidosis (8.8%). Of the 25 patients with advanced nephrosclerosis, 24 had renal failure, 20 were hypertensive, and 13 had cholesterol emboli. Of 33 patients with diabetes mellitus, 66.7% were found to have lesions not related to diabetes.

It was found that the frequency of IgM deposition in the renal glomeruli increased significantly during the course of illness from 11\/30 to 21\/30, while the IgA, IgG and complement (C3, C4, C1q) deposition remained rather stationary. Comparing the group of patients who were deficient in IgM deposits with those who procured this particular Ig during the illness, there were striking differences in the frequency of occurrence of nephrosis, glomerulosclerosis, severe tubular-interstitial lesion and renal insufficiency. The frequency was much higher in the IgM deposited patients In conclusion: (1) Deposition of IgM might happen during the course of IgA nephropathy as a secondary phenomenon. (2) Presence of IgM in the glomeruli immune deposits denote a poor prognosis for patients of IgA nephropathy.",

The patients were examined for central hemodynamics, hormonal background (plasma renin activity) (PRA), plasma aldosterone and cortisol concentration. 14 patients underwent closed puncture biopsy of the kidneys. All the patients manifested high PRA associated activation of gluco- and mineralocorticoid adrenal function along with the hyperkinetic syndrome. MAH was characterized by dramatic discrepancy between the stroke and cardiac indices and specific peripheral resistance. Nephrosclerosis whose extent varied, attaining maximum in patients with associated essential hypertension and renal failure and in autopsy material, in addition to severe lesions of the renal vessels appeared to be the common feature of all morphological alterations. Plasmic impregnation and fibrinoid necrosis of the arterioles were not detectable in all the patients, being of focal character. The same alterations were identified in the patients during exacerbation of glomerulonephritis and in the absence of MAH. The data obtained point to the nonuniformity of MAH. Four clinicomorphological variants of MAH are suggested.",

        "Abstract":"Kidney biopsy (KB) is controversial in the elderly because it is generally felt that the risks exceed the potential therapeutic benefits. In this review of our personal experience and the literature reports, we discuss the risks of this diagnostic procedure and its use in the four main circumstances of patient referral. On the one hand, KB does not seem to be more hazardous in the elderly, provided that it is not performed in patients in poor condition or with atrophic kidneys or suspected vascular lesions. On the other hand, KB is clearly useful in a number of elderly patients either to assess the diagnosis of a systemic disease involving the kidney or to select the appropriate treatment. 1. In patients with non nephrotic proteinuria, KB should be performed if the proteinuria is associated with extra-renal signs suggestive of systemic disease or with deterioration of renal function. 2. Nephrotic syndrome without evidence of amyloidosis and diabetes, should lead to KB to identify patients with minimal change disease (MCD) requiring steroid treatment. Indeed, MCD can rarely be suspected on clinical grounds as the resulting nephrotic syndrome is rarely \"pure\" at this age. 3. In acute renal failure, KB seems to be essential and urgent in patients with rapidly progressive glomerulonephritis and in those with renal failure of dubious origin to select the most appropriate treatment according to the etiology and the type of renal lesions (sclerotic or \"active\"). 4. KB is useless and hazardous in chronic renal failure, except in case of unexplained rapid worsening of renal function in patients with previously moderate renal failure.",

A 69-year-old man was referred because of progressive renal failure two months after major angiography for occlusive arterial disease of lower limbs. The physical examination on admission revealed an uncontrollable hypertension. The laboratory findings showed elevated serum creatinine (7.5 mg\/dl) and eosinophilia (1022\/mm3) with normal urinalysis findings. Renal biopsy disclosed a occlusive lesion of the arcuate artery which contained cholesterol clefts and foam cells, and showed ischemic renal parenchymal changes. These findings were compatible with cholesterol atheroembolic renal disease. In spite of the aggressive medical treatment, renal function had deteriorated progressively and the patient has been on regular hemodialysis. Atheroembolic renal failure after arteriography have been reported recently, but the case diagnosed by renal biopsy has been rare. Since there is no therapeutic way to reverse this type of renal failure, strict selection of patients for the angiographic examination and use of flexible catheter might be mandatory. Subacute course of renal failure after angiography and eosinophilia seem to be the important diagnostic clues for this disorder.",

The behaviour of the patient was directly responsible for five (11.6%) of the deaths, by suicide in three cases and dietary non-compliance in two cases. Hypothetical mechanisms linking depression with reduced survival have been reviewed. As the impact of depression on survival was maximal in the first few years of dialysis, monitoring for depression should be incorporated into routine care from the start of dialysis together with evaluative interventions that might enhance survival.",

        "Abstract":"The prognostic markers in 87 consecutive patients with lupus nephritis who underwent renal biopsy are reported for five clinically relevant long-term outcomes--renal insufficiency, renal failure, death due to renal systemic lupus erythematosus, death due to non-renal SLE and death due to SLE, both renal and non-renal. We have demonstrated that a number of previously neglected or rarely studied predictors were important prognostic markers. These included the duration of renal disease before biopsy, overall severity of SLE, as well as the presence of vasculitis, hypertension or a comorbid ailment. Furthermore, the study confirms the predictive importance of serum creatinine, 24-h urinary excretion of protein, C3, and of the activity and chronicity indices on biopsy. However, overall a simple measure of tubulointerstitial disease was the best predictor obtained from biopsy. Prognostic models based on clinical data alone were developed for each of the five outcomes. The models amplify our clinical understanding of lupus nephritis. Markers of renal severity were most important in predicting renal outcomes such as renal insufficiency and renal failure. Prognostic factors less directly related to renal disease (comorbidity and vasculitis) were important predictors of fatality. A marker of immunologic disease activity (C3) was a valuable predictor for many of the outcomes. Thus markers of disease severity reflecting organ damage due to SLE and other comorbid conditions could be combined with markers of immunologic activity to predict a variety of outcomes of relevance to a clinician. When biopsy data obtained by light or electron microscopy were evaluated for their ability to add new predictive information to the clinical models, only a limited value for biopsy was noted. It is likely that this reflected the close correlational relationships between clinical and biopsy variables, the strong clinical models generated, and the inclusion in the clinical models of the previously neglected clinical variables, duration of renal disease before biopsy and the presence of vasculitis or comorbid disease.",

The occurrence of these microradiographic signs of fluorosis does not seem to be linked either to the age of the patients, to the interval elapsed since ovarian function ceased, or to the degree of bone remodelling at the time that treatment was started. Moreover, none of these patients showed signs of even moderate renal insufficiency. Should the development of this fluorosis, which is most frequently clinically asymptomatic, be considered as a condition or as a factor in therapeutic efficacy?

Fifty-seven consecutive children, aged between 10 weeks to 16 years, who underwent a renal biopsy at the Departments of Paediatrics, National University of Singapore and Singapore General Hospital over an 8 year period were studied. The main indications for biopsy were nephrotic syndrome (67%), recurrent gross haematuria (16%), nephritic syndrome (7%), and renal failure (10%). Primary GN occurred in 81%, while secondary GN was seen in 19%, the most common being lupus nephritis. Of the primary GN, minor abnormalities was the most common (22%), followed by focal global sclerosis (20%), focal segmental glomerulosclerosis (17%), diffuse mesangial proliferative GN (11%), focal mesangial proliferative GN (9%), membranous GN (7%), diffuse endocapillary GN (4%), diffuse sclerosing GN (4%), diffuse mesangial sclerosis (4%), and diffuse crescentic GN (2%). Immunofluorescent examination was performed in 50 children. IgA nephropathy was diagnosed in 17% of the patients with primary GN. Of the children with primary nephrotic syndrome due to minimal change disease or focal global sclerosis, about half had IgM mesangial deposits. Of 47 patients who were followed up, 9 developed chronic renal failure, of which 7 reached end-stage disease (4 have died, while 3 are on chronic dialysis). Three other patients died of other complications. The histopathological findings influenced the therapeutic decision in 49% of our patients. In summary, the pattern of GN in our cohort of patients tended to reflect more severe glomerular lesions, mainly due to our criteria of selection for renal biopsy.",

We concluded that kidney biopsy in patients with chronic renal failure is mandatory especially if they are going to be transplanted and it is relatively safe especially when the percutaneous technique is employed.",

We evaluated data on steroid and platelet-inhibitor therapies and a new clinical strategy, empiric sequential therapy. This sequential approach involves use of short-term alternate-day steroid agents, followed by long-term platelet inhibitors for persistent nephrotic syndrome. Our results indicate that, contrary to usual practice, use of renal biopsy is not necessary in caring for adult patients with idiopathic nephrotic syndrome; empiric short-term alternate-day steroid therapy is equally efficacious. If the benefits of platelet-inhibitor therapy for treating membranoproliferative glomerulonephritis are confirmed, empiric sequential therapy also will be equally efficacious. Our study shows how decision analysis can be used to identify superfluous diagnostic procedures.",

However, most changes in tissue water and electrolytes are nonspecific and reflect the degree of sickness; they cannot be used for evaluation of malnutrition, except to indicate whether there is a loss or excess of intracellular ions, such as potassium and magnesium. In patients without disturbances in potassium metabolism, muscle cell potassium and protein are strongly correlated, but this relationship does not hold true in patients with potassium depletion. Accumulation and loss of potassium occur in parallel with changes in muscle glycogen, independent of other muscle constituents, eg, magnesium. Potassium depletion and excess, as well as changes in muscle glycogen, must be considered when evaluating the relation of lean body mass and total body protein content to total body potassium.",

However, if only patients with normal renal function were considered, prevalence of hypertension (12.7%) was not higher than in the control group. Hypertension was more frequent in focal segmental sclerosis (30%) and in membranous glomerulonephritis (26%) than in IgA nephropathy (9%), membranoproliferative glomerulonephritis (11%) and IgM mesangial glomerulonephritis (12%). Five years after renal biopsy, 92% of normotensive and 47% of hypertensive patients remained with normal renal function (p less than 0.001). These findings suggest that the high prevalence of hypertension in chronic glomerulonephritis is related to the declining renal function.

One determinant of AH at the first two of these stages appears to have been damage to the antihypertensive system of the renal medulla, while the increased rate of AH at the azotemic stage was found to be associated with sodium retention in the body.

        "Abstract":"Tissue calcium content from 246 diagnostic human renal biopsies was measured to assess whether elevated tissue calcium concentration could be demonstrated to exist early during the course of human renal disease or was only a manifestation of advanced renal impairment. Renal calcium content correlated significantly with serum creatinine (r = +0.23, P less than 0.001, N = 246); serum phosphate P less than 0.001, N = 169) but not with serum calcium (r = -0.10, P greater than 0.1, N = 193). Fivefold greater calcium content was measured in biopsied patients with normal renal function than in normal postmortem renal tissue (35.7 +\/- 5.2 vs. 7.6 +\/- 0.7 mgCa\/100 g wet renal tissue, P less than 0.001). Those biopsied patients with significant functional impairment (SCr greater than 1.5 mg\/dl) had a higher mean level of serum phosphorus and serum [Ca] X [P] product than patients with normal renal function (5.19 +\/- 0.22 vs. 3.92 +\/- 0.11 mg P\/dl and 44.8 +\/- 1.8 vs. 35.7 +\/- 1.2 mg2\/dl2, respectively), and slightly higher renal calcium content (85.3 +\/- 32.2 vs. 35.7 +\/- 5.2 Ca\/100 g wet renal tissue, P = 0.06), which correlated with histologic calcium deposition (r = +0.52, P less than 0.02, N = 20). These findings are consistent with the hypothesis that renal calcium deposition begins early in the course of a variety of renal diseases and hence may play a secondary pathogenetic role that accelerates progression to chronic renal failure.

The biopsy showed a mild interstitial lymphocytic infiltrate and immunosuppression was not changed. A second renal biopsy was performed 66 days after transplantation because of a persistent elevation of the serum creatinine following a cytomegalovirus (CMV) infection. CMV inclusions were seen by light microscopy (LM) in glomerular and peritubular capillary endothelial cells and tubular epithelial cells but no viral inclusions were present on the grids examined by electron microscopy (EM). However, the inclusions seen by LM were confirmed as CMV by immunohistochemistry, using polyclonal and monoclonal antibodies to CMV, and by in situ hybridization, using a biotinylated CMV DNA probe, emphasizing the usefulness of these techniques when studies by EM are not contributory.",

A history of apparently similar renal symptoms was obtained in another 3 family members. In addition to GBM abnormalities, renal biopsy features included a slight mesangial matrix increase, occasional mesangial cell excess and often appreciable pedicel effacement. There were scanty electron-dense deposits. The mean thickness of the GBM varied from 206 to 301 nm, whereas in IgA nephropathy patients used as controls it was 356-464 nm. It is concluded that some of the lesions in adults are 'benign', and some progressive.

These biopsies were done in patients in whom diagnosis was not clear or clinical rejection was deemed to be severe. Clinical diagnosis at initial biopsy was compared with the morphological diagnosis. To determine if morphological data improved the prognostic usefulness of the clinical data, we performed multiple logistic regression relating clinical variables at initial biopsy and histological changes in the transplant to the outcome of 120 patients one year after biopsy. The clinical and morphological diagnosis differed in 41 of 89 patients (46%). Of 120 patients in the prognostic study, 35 returned to dialysis during the first year following transplantation. Using multiple logistic regression, a categorical variable that took into account both the serum creatinine and its rate of change before biopsy was the best clinical predictor of return to dialysis. Further increase in chi 2 occurred with type of donor, number of transfusions, and age. Using the clinical variables we produced an index, from 0 to 1 to predict outcome. Only 8 had index less than 0.2, of whom 7 returned to dialysis. The best morphological predictor of outcome was interstitial hemorrhage. Further increase in chi 2 was obtained with vascular endothelial proliferation, glomerular endothelial swelling, and glomerular necrosis. With an index derived from the morphological variables only 11 had index less than 0.2, of whom 9 returned to dialysis. Combining both clinical and morphological data, the best predictor of return to dialysis was interstitial hemorrhage, followed by creatinine, glomerular endothelial swelling, and type of donor. Using both clinical and morphological variables we produced another index to predict outcome. A group of 65 patients had index greater than 0.8, of whom 63 (94%) did not return to dialysis, and 18 patients had index less than 0.2, 17 of whom returned to dialysis. The remaining 12 patients in the dialysis group and 15 in the nondialysis group had indices greater than 0.2 less than 0.8. We conclude that a transplant biopsy yields important diagnostic and prognostic information. Unexpected diagnoses were made in 46% of cases. The addition of morphological data to the clinical data available at time of biopsy greatly improved the prediction of return to dialysis.",

One showed evidence of encephalopathy, two presented with fractures and one was asymptomatic. Hypercalcaemia was constant, whereas high serum aluminium levels were present in only 2 patients. In all cases, iliac bone biopsy specimens, non-decalcified and stained with Aluminium , were found to contain aluminium deposits along the mineralization fronts, thus confirming the diagnosis of aluminium overload. In addition, biopsies revealed an excess of osteoid tissue with morphological and dynamic signs of osteomalacia (2 cases) or strongly depressed bone formation (2 cases). Histomorphometric bone biopsy appears to be the best mean of diagnosing aluminium intoxication and analyzing its effects on bone remodeling and mineralization.

        "Abstract":"Evidence for muscle protein wasting and abnormal muscle metabolism is common in uremia. Muscle DNA content is considered a reliable reference standard in normal and undernourished adults. Muscle RNA content rapidly changes during starvation and refeeding. The ratio of noncollagen alkali-soluble proteins (ASP) to DNA is considered to be an estimate of the cytoplasmic volume of a single cell, and the RNA: DNA ratio is an index of the ribosomal capacity for protein synthesis. Muscle DNA, RNA, ASP, water, and fat content were determined in muscle biopsy specimens from chronically uremic patients receiving conservative treatment (CT), maintenance hemodialysis (two centers), or CAPD. Nutrient intake was low and the anthropometric indices were decreased in all groups of patients, except in the hemodialysis patients from one center. Serum proteins and muscle ASP: DNA and RNA: DNA ratios were decreased. The nutritional status was reassessed in some malnourished CAPD patients after about one year of careful nutritional advice and was unchanged. These results suggest that chronically uremic patients on CT are often malnourished, primarily because of an inadequate protein and\/or energy intake. Muscle nucleic acid and protein content are useful tools for nutritional assessment at a cellular level in humans with chronic renal failure and can be used to monitor the response to nutritional therapy.",

The mean interval between clinical manifestation of nephropathy and biopsy was about 2 years. At the time of biopsy, 4 groups were distinguished according to clinical conditions, depending on the presence or absence of nephrotic syndrome and renal failure. Renal lesions were semiquantitatively evaluated, a separate score being considered for glomerular and vascular lesions. Immunofluorescence most frequently showed a pattern of faint linear IgG deposits along glomerular basement membranes. Severity of histological lesions and pattern of urinary abnormalities were not correlated with the duration of diabetes or the patients' age. Both glomerular and vascular lesions were correlated with the presence of renal failure, while no relationship with the pattern of urinary abnormalities was found. Fourteen patients were followed for more than one year after biopsy: 5 had normal renal function, 4 were in chronic renal insufficiency and 5 in end-stage renal failure (3 were in dialysis, 2 died). There was no correlation between the 3 above-mentioned types of evolution and glomerular histological findings. Nevertheless a higher score of vascular impairment at biopsy was observed among patients who subsequently were found to have a more unfavorable prognosis. Therefore renal biopsy, by providing information on the degree of renal vascular damage, may have some value in predicting the clinical course of diabetic nephropathy.",

The combination of juvenile nephronophthisis and tapeto-retinal degeneration, renal-retinal dystrophy, may cause blindness in infancy, and renal failure in the first decade of life. This syndrome has not been previously described as a cause of renal failure in young infants. We report an infant who presented at three months of age with blindness and renal insufficiency. In addition, this infant had a disproportionate degree of hypocalcemia and hyperphosphatemia compatible with relative parathyroid gland insufficiency.

Nine children were serially investigated, and nine adolescents or young adults, who were considered to have clinically recovered, were investigated only once, 10.5-14 years after the onset. Inulin and PAH clearance, as well as sodium excretion, were determined during hydropenia (HP) and 3% volume expansion (VE) with isotonic saline. In most patients in the former group a renal biopsy was performed during the first investigation and again one year later. The early disturbances in renal function resembled those we have found in other types of GN. The GFR was normal during HP or after VE in most cases one year after the onset. The natriuretic response to VE was decreased in most patients initially, and this was found to persist in half of the patients 2-3 years after the onset. Pathological urinalyses then indicated disturbances in the renal handling of sodium. A reduced capacity to excrete sodium, however, did not seem to be of prognostic significance since all patients, except one who developed renal insufficiency and hypertension, had normal urinalyses and blood pressure six years after the onset. This study provides no evidence that subjects with previous HS GN will later develop impaired renal function or be predisposed to hypertension.",

Acute bacterial interstitial nephritis occurring in a previously diseased kidney, although well documented in experimental animals, has not been shown to aggravate chronic renal failure in man. We report on 3 cases of acute suppurative interstitial nephritis, due to E. coli urinary infection complicated by septicemia. All had rapid aggravation of previously mild renal failure secondary to chronic interstitial nephritis. Sepsis originated from the urinary tract which in 2 instances had been temporarily obstructed. Renal biopsy disclosed a diffuse interstitial infiltrate containing numerous polymorphonuclear leukocytes. This was superimposed on chronic tubular and interstitial lesions. In 1 case there were glomerular lesions with crescents and mesangial C3 deposits. A 2nd biopsy performed in 2 cases was of prognostic interest. In one case it showed active lesions and the necessity of continuing the treatment and in the other a satisfactory healing allowing cessation of therapy. Treatment was guided by antibiograms, the clinical and urinary signs of activity, renal biopsy findings and antibiotics known to be concentrated in renal tissue. The duration of treatment seemed important for the regression of acute renal lesions. Hematogenous bacterial interstitial nephritis should be considered as a possible cause of aggravation in chronic renal failure.",

        "Published":null,
        "Abstract":"It has recently been proposed that renal cortical interstitial fibrosis is causally related to progressive decreases in glomerular filtration rate in a variety of renal diseases including glomerulonephritis. One hundred and eighty-eight renal biopsies in 81 patients with mesangial IgA nephropathy were analyzed for the percentage of relative interstitial volume by a point-counting technique. These data were correlated with serum creatinine, endogenous creatinine, endogenous creatinine clearance, and from age-matched donors were used as controls for the interstitial volume measurement. There was a negative nonlinear correlation between percentage of interstitial volume measurement. There was a negative nonlinear correlation between percentage of interstitial volume and creatinine clearance (r = 0.601, p less than 0.001). These correlations were not explained by age. However, serial biopsies in 39 patients clearly demonstrated that the percentage of interstitial volume could be dissociated from creatinine clearance. The prognosis in individual patients for progression to chronic renal failure could not be predicted from the relative interstitial volume at initial biopsy. Patients with mesangial IgA nephropathy demonstrated higher interstitial volumes than age-matched cadaver donors (p less than 0.001). Although interstitial volume and creatinine clearance are inversely related, the ability to dissociate these two variables in serial biopsies draws into question the hypothesis that interstitial fibrosis is causally related to changes in creatinine clearance. Studies to validate this hypothesis should involve patients followed with serial biopsies and renal function studies. In mesangial IgA nephropathy, interstitial changes are most likely secondary to the activity of the glomerular process.",

        "Abstract":"Renal biopsies obtained from 20 adult patients within 30 days after onset of acute renal failure with microangiopathic hemolytic anemia (\"the hemolytic-uremic syndrome\") were studied. Lesions were graded independently by two observers without knowledge of the clinical history. All patients who did not have refractory hypertension were treated with heparin. Ten of the patients died, and four developed end-stage renal failure requiring chronic dialysis. Six patients, however, had a relatively good outcome: two recovered completely and four developed mild-to-moderate chronic renal failure not requiring dialysis. The six patients with a good outcome had significantly less severe arterial intimal thickening on biopsy compared with the remaining patients with a poor outcome. The patients with a good outcome and those with a poor outcome did not differ in the severity of glomerular lesions. The clinical features did not allow a prediction of late outcome. These results suggest that early renal biopsies may be helpful in predicting prognosis in the \"hemolytic-uremic syndrome.\" This clinical syndrome may occur either in apparently healthy people, or may complicate the course of a chronic essential hypertension.",

Of 186 receiving transplants since 1974, seven (4 per cent) have died within one year of operation. The incidence of wound infections has been reduced from approximately 25 per cent in 1972 to 2 per cent since 1976 by the use of a single high dose of broad-spectrum antibiotics administered at the time of induction of anesthesia for any surgical procedure. Risk and limitations of immunosuppression have been better appreciated, ultrasound is used more often in the diagnosis of partial obstruction or perinephric fluid collections, and needle biopsy of the transplanted kidney has reduced the morbidity inherent in open biopsy. The contribution of sepsis as a cause of death has declined. The diminishing hazard of renal transplantation has made it an increasingly attractive treatment for end-stage kidney disease.",

The advisability of renal needle biopsy in uncontrolled hypertension is questioned. Cases of intrarenal arteriovenous fistulas resulting from percutaneous needle biopsy of the kidney are being reported with increasing frequency. The exact incidence of fistula formation after kidney biopsy is unknown, but several series based on arteriographic studies show an incidence as high as 18 per cent. Although many of these fistulas disappear spontaneously, approximately 4 per cent persist. A review of the literature failed to reveal the incidence of aneurysmal formation. Our case was complicated by formation of bilateral renal arteriovenous fistulas secondary to repeat bilateral percutaneous needle biopsy and right open renal biopsy. Subsequent gross hematuria from the right ureteral orifice also resulted which was proved by cystoscopy and required replacement with several units of blood.

The principal glomerular lesion was a focal and segmental proliferative glomerulonephritis in 15, a diffuse proliferative glomerulonephritis in 6 and a animal or minor change lesion with mesangial hypertrophy in 3 cases. The proliferation of the cells was mainly mesangial. Renal biopsies taken earlier in the course of the disease showed a greater number with a focal lesion. Electron dense deposits with cellular proliferation and increased matrix were seen in the mesangium. Less frequent subendothelial and occasional subepithelial deposits were found. Capillary loop changes were seen more frequently in the later stages of the disease. Heavy deposits of IgA were found in the mesangium in all cases, and less intense deposits of IgG in 60%. beta 1 C globulin and fibrinogen were found in 80% and IgD and IgM less frequently. Complement activation was via the alternate pathway as early complement components C1q and C4 were absent. Overt allergies, streptococal infections and the HBsAg could not explain the pathogenesis of the disease. Henoch-Schoenlein syndrome is a chronic disease of the mesangium; only 5 patients showed complete recovery, 15 had persistent microscopic hematuria and 3 died or developed renal insufficiency within 8 years. The prognosis was worst with diffuse proliferative glomerulonephritis, widespread focal glomerulonephritis or epithelial cresents formation.",

In nearly all cases with chronic diseases a remodelling of bones and especially processes of bone resorption were found. A fibroosteoclastic bone resorption was evident in 28 of 40 cases with chronic renal failures, in 5 of 26 cases with chronic lung diseases and\/or chronic insufficiency of the right heart ventricle, in 4 of 12 cases with chronic diseases of the gastro-intestinal tract, and in a case of lung cancer. Processes of bone formation were less prominent. The findings indicate that several chronic diseases caused by different overlapping pathogenetic mechanisms can principally lead to the same spectrum of alterations of bone structure. This and the aetiological ambiguity of typical patho-histological reaction patterns of bones require a critical reserve in the interpretation of adequate findings in bone biopsies. It has been pointed out that the use of morphometric methods and the use of slices of undecalcified bones are necessary to obtain a reliable diagnostic tool in bone biopsies.",

        "Abstract":"Morphometric investigations in 40 patients suffering from perimembranous glomerulonephritis at different stages showed that there is no certain relationship between the severity of glomerular lesions and the serum creatinine level. In 19 cases in stages I-III, with serum creatinine level less than 1.2 mg\/100 ml on biopsy, the renal interstitium was less enlarged than in 21 cases in the same stages, but with serum creatinine level higher than 2 mg\/100 ml. There is a significant positive correlation between the relative interstitial volume and the level of serum creatinine. The best congruence was demonstrated in the lin\/log-plotting indicating that our values correlate best with an exponential function. We therefore conclude that in perimembranous glomerulonephritis, generally considered to be a glomerular disease, functional impairment cannot be explained by the glomerular lesions alone; interstitial changes have also to be taken into account as a cause of renal insufficiency. The following hypothesis is proposed; that the increase in renal interstitium and possible shrinking of collagen fibres may lead to a narrowing of intertubular capillaries. This may result in slowing of glomerular blood flow and may lead to renal insufficiency.",

Renal cortical tissue obtained by percutaneous needle biopsy (23 of 27 tissue specimens) was incubated in vitro using a modified renal cortical slice technic. Following incubation in medium containing 3H-PAH, the biopsy fragment was snap-frozen, and section freeze-dry autoradiographs were prepared. The autoradiographs demonstrated cellular accumulation of 3H-PAH by proximal tubules of human kidney in vitro and suggest that PAH transport is uphill across the luminal as well as the antiluminal membrane. The number of proximal tubules which accumulate 3H-PAH in vitro diminishes as renal failure progresses. Cellular accumulation of PAH, however, was not impaired by heavy proteinuria, and appeared not to be related to the underlying glomerular histologic diagnosis. The frequency of proximal tubules showing 3H-PAH uptake in the cortex varied directly with the glomerular filtration rate and inversely with the degree of interstitial involvement. Proximal tubules which maintain the ability to accumulate 3H-PAH are clustered in fewer regions of the cortex in patients with reduced glomerular filtration rates. This observation is consistent with the view that residual renal function is renal failure arises from a few relatively normal nephrons rather than from a more uniformly damaged population of nephrons.",

In late group bone histomorphometry showed quite evident signs of secondary hyperparathyroidism and hyperosteoidism which remarkably worsened 3-4 years after dialysis. The aminoacids composition of the bone showed an increase in the total amount of aminoacids during dialysis, expecially for proline, hydroxyproline and glycine. In early group both basic values and progression rate of bone lesions were less severe. In transplanted patients with good renal function (serum creatinine less than 1.4 mg%) bone histomorphometric analysis showed a rather rapid disappearance of uremic bone lesions. A significant correlation was found between serum PTH, renal function and bone histology. On some occasions signs of secondary hyperparathyroidism were documented even after 16 months.

As phosphorus (P) and hydroxyproline (Hypro) constitute a constant fraction of bone mineral and collagen, respectively, the P\/Hypro ratio in bone tissue provides an estimate of the degree of mineralization. The P\/Hydro ratio has been studied in bone biopsies from 42 patients with severe chronic renal failure. A few of them had a subnormal P\/Hypro ratio and these patients corresponded to the diagnosis of classical osteomalacia or probably hyperparathyroidism. However, the mean bone P\/Hypro ratio was significantly higher than normal, indicating a general tendency towards a higher degree of bone mineralization in patients with chronic renal failure.",

They were unusual in that the liver first gave risr to symptoms and the renal lesions were completely latent. Both hepatic and renal lesions were well tolerated in spite of hepatomegally. They emphasize the interest of laparoscopy and biopsy of the liver under direct vision, and selective aortography, in the diagnosis. They discuss the basic differences between polycystic liver and kidney in adults, from that in children ornewborn, and caroli's disease. Finally, they emphasize the usually poor prognosis dominated by progressive renal failure which should guide treatment. The latter depends on periodic supervision of the patient for the disease usually evolves slowly. Treatment should therefore be conservative. Tn some cases, however, renal transplantaton should be considered before irreversible renal failure in young subjects, at an age when it is still possible. On the other hand, the liver lesions do not require any radical treatment, unless there is intercurrent infection or pressure on neighbouringorgans.",

        "Abstract":"The purpose of the present paper was to study clinical, morphological and immunological aspects of late rejection of renal allotransplants. We have, therefore, analyzed the occurrence and nature of renal transplant disease and graft failure among 125 recipients surviving for 1 to more than 8 years after transplantation. In this population transplant disease as defined by the appearance of heavy proteinuria and\/or steadily declining graft function occurred in 22 patients. At the closure date of the study on December 31, 1972 complete graft failure had occurred in 12 of these 22 patients and 4 of these have died. In addition two patients died in the presence of normal graft function, due to chronic hepatitis and metastatic cancer respectively. As based on clinical findings, pathophysiological features and renal lesions the patients with late transplant disease were classified into two groups and described accordingly. Group A, termed glomerular transplant disease, included a majority of 16 patients, constituting a rather homogenous idsease entity in relation to course of disease, clinical findings and renal lesions as studied by light-, immunofluorescence- and electron microscopy. All these patients presented with heavy proteinuria, which was non-selective in all but two, resulting eventually in complete loss of graft function in eight cases. All these patients developed hypoalbuminemia and hypercholesterolemia, and one half manifested a classical nephrotic syndrome. Arterial hypertension occurred in all patients except two. Glomerular structure as studied by light microscopy revealed a number of lesions of a rather polymorphous pattern in all patients in group A. Endomesangial proliferation, hyperplasia and segmental proliferation of epithelial cells and thickening of capillary walls were prominent features, although the degree of severity, extension and type of lesion occurred in such varying proportions that classification into any well characterized category of glomerulonephritis was not possible. All cases in group A revealed immune deposits, most frequently containing IgG, IgM, complement and fibrinogen. IgA, IgD and IgE were also demonstrated in a lesser proportion of cases in this group. The immunofluorescent pattern was a mixed granular and linear, and in no case strictly linear or granular alone. The ultrastructural investigation contains a detailed analysis of the",
