        "Abstract":"This study reports quantitative information on the concentration of complement receptor for C3b and C4b (CR1) on erythrocytes from normal individuals and patients with immune complex disease. The measurements were performed by an immunoradiometric assay using monoclonal antibodies against CR1. The antibody specificity was confirmed by immunoprecipitation of CR1 from extracts of surface-labeled cells, by inhibition of rosette formation between B lymphocytes and the erythrocytes intermediate EAC14oxy23b, and by the characteristic distribution of the antigen among cells of human peripheral blood. The number of CR1 molecules in erythrocytes from 52 normal individuals was estimated as 1,410 +\/- 620. No significant differences in CR1 levels were observed when individuals were grouped by sex, age, or blood groups. In patients with SLE and rheumatoid arthritis, the number of CR1 molecules per RBC was significantly lower, i.e., 600 +\/- 307 and 903 +\/- 417, respectively. CR1 levels were normal in asthmatics undergoing long-term treatment with prednisone. In SLE patients, significant correlations were found between CR1 levels, C4 hemolytic titers, and levels of circulating immune complexes. In two out of four patients with SLE, CR1 levels increased significantly during remission, showing that the deficiency is, at least in part, reversible. The deficiency in CR1 could be genetically controlled or could represent an epiphenomenon caused by the interaction of the receptor with a ligand present in the circulation of patients.",

        "Published":"2012 May 14",
        "Abstract":"INTRODUCTION: In early rheumatoid arthritis (RA), low-dose oral prednisone (PDN) co-medication yields better clinical results than monotherapy with disease-modifying anti-rheumatic drugs (DMARDs). In addition, ultrasonography (US) evaluation reveals rapid and significant effects of glucocorticosteroids on subclinical synovitis. No data currently exist that examine the clinical and US results offered by glucocorticoid co-medication over DMARD monotherapy in early RA patients. METHODS: Two hundred and twenty patients with early RA (< 1 year from clinical onset) were treated according to a low disease activity (LDA) targeted step-up protocol including methotrexate (MTX) and, in the active treatment arm, low-dose (6.25 mg\/day) oral PDN over 12 months. Clinical disease activity measures were collected at baseline, 2, 4, 6, 9 and 12 months, and US examination of hands was performed at baseline, 6 and 12 months. Grey-scale and power Doppler (PD) synovitis were scored (0 to 3) for each joint. At 12 months, clinical remission according to the disease activity score among 28 joints was defined as the clinical outcome, and a total joint PD score of 0 (PD negativity) as the imaging outcome. RESULTS: Each group included 110 patients with comparable demographic, clinical, laboratory and US characteristics. At 12 months, the LDA rate was similar in the two groups, whilst the clinical remission rate (risk ratio = 1.61 (95% confidence interval = 1.08, 2.04)) and PD negativity rate (risk ratio = 1.31 (95% confidence interval = 1.04, 1.64)) were significantly higher in the MTX+PDN group. CONCLUSION: In early RA, despite a similar response rate in terms of LDA, low-dose oral PDN co-medication led to a higher proportion of clinical remission and PD negativity compared with MTX monotherapy, thus ensuring a better disease activity control.

        "Published":"2013 Aug",
        "Abstract":"BACKGROUND: Tumor necrosis factor-alpha (TNF-alpha) antibodies are currently used in patients with moderate to severe Crohn's disease (CD) who are unresponsive to conventional therapies. Certolizumab pegol (Cp) is one of the anti-TNF-alpha agents introduced for the management of CD and rheumatoid arthritis. OBJECTIVES: The aim of this meta-analysis is to assess the efficacy of Cp in inducing clinical response and remission in CD and the associated adverse events. The effect of Cp in terms of CD patients' C-reactive protein (CRP) level was also studied. PATIENTS AND METHODS: Literature was searched for studies investigated the efficacy of Cp on inducing clinical response and maintaining remission in the patients with CD between 1966 and July 2012. RESULTS: Among 165 potentially relevant studies, six with a total of 1695 patients met the inclusion criteria and were meta-analyzed. In comparison to control groups, patients who received Cp had a relative risk (RR) of 1.38 with absolute risk reduction (ARR) = 0.12; 95% CI = 0.03 to 0.21), number needed for treatment (NNT) = 9; P < 0.0001 ) for clinical response and RR of 1.54 (ARR = 0.09; 95% CI = -0.0198 to 0.2), (NNT = 12; P < 0.0001) for maintenance of clinical remission and non-significant RR of 1.24 (P = 0.052) for induction of clinical remission. Baseline CRP did not significantly alter the magnitude or response. Adverse events were not significantly different among patients receiving Cp comparing to placebo. CONCLUSIONS: Cp is effective for inducing clinical response and maintenance of clinical remission in patients with moderate to severe CD with similar side-effect profile as the control arms.",

        "Published":"2012 Oct 17",
        "Abstract":"BACKGROUND: Ulcerative colitis (UC) is a chronic inflammatory condition of the colon characterized by episodes of disease activity and symptom-free remission. There is paucity of evidence regarding the efficacy and safety of complementary or alternative medicines for the management of UC. Curcumin, an anti-inflammatory agent, has been used in many chronic inflammatory conditions such as rheumatoid arthritis, esophagitis and post-surgical inflammation. The efficacy of this agent for maintenance of remission in patients with UC has not been systematically evaluated. OBJECTIVES: The primary objective was to systematically review the efficacy and safety of curcumin for maintenance of remission in UC. SEARCH METHODS: A computer-assisted literature search of MEDLINE, EMBASE, the Cochrane Central Register of Controlled Trials, and the Cochrane Inflammatory Bowel Disease Specialized Trial Register was performed on July 11, 2012 to identify relevant publications. Proceedings from major gastroenterology meetings and references from published articles were also searched to identify additional studies. SELECTION CRITERIA: Randomized placebo-controlled trials (RCT) of curcumin for maintenance of remission in UC were included. Studies included patients (of any age) who were in remission at the time of recruitment. Co-interventions were allowed. DATA COLLECTION AND ANALYSIS: Two authors independently extracted data and assessed the methodological quality of the included studies using the Cochrane risk of bias tool. Data were analyzed using Review Manager (RevMan 5.1). We calculated the relative risk (RR) and 95% confidence interval (95% CI) for each dichotomous outcome. For continuous outcomes we calculated the mean difference (MD) and 95% CI. MAIN RESULTS: Only one trial (89 patients) fulfilled the inclusion criteria. This trial randomized 45 patients to curcumin and 44 patients to placebo. All patients received treatment with sulfasalazine or mesalamine. The study was rated as low risk of bias. Curcumin was administered orally in a dose of 2 g\/day for six months. Fewer patients relapsed in the curcumin group than the placebo group at six months. Four per cent of patients in the curcumin group relapsed at six months compared to 18% of patients in the placebo group (RR 0.24, 95% CI 0.05 to 1.09; P = 0.06). There was no statistically significant difference in relapse rates at 12 months. Twenty-two per cent of curcumin patients relapsed at 12 months compared to 32% of placebo patients (RR 0.70, 95% CI 0.35 to 1.40; P = 0.31). A total of nine adverse events were reported in seven patients. These adverse events included sensation of abdominal bulging, nausea, transient hypertension, and transient increase in the number of stools. The authors did not report which treatment group the patients who experienced adverse events belonged to. The clinical activity index (CAI) at six months was significantly lower in the curcumin group compared to the placebo group (1.0 + 2.0 versus 2.2 + 2.3; MD -1.20, 95% CI -2.14 to -0.26). The endoscopic index (EI) at six months was significantly lower in the curcumin group than in the placebo group (0.8 + 0.6 versus 1.6 + 1.6; MD -0.80, 95% CI -1.33 to -0.27). AUTHORS' CONCLUSIONS: Curcumin may be a safe and effective therapy for maintenance of remission in quiescent UC when given as adjunctive therapy along with mesalamine or sulfasalazine. However, further research in the form of a large scale methodologically rigorous randomized controlled trial is needed to confirm any possible benefit of curcumin in quiescent UC.",

        "Published":"2014 Feb",
        "Abstract":"BACKGROUND: Rotator cuff disease (RCD) is a complex process influenced by a multitude of factors, and a number of gene pathways are altered in rotator cuff tears. Polymorphisms in these genes can lead to an extended tendon degeneration process, which explains why subsets of patients are more susceptible to RCD. MATERIALS AND METHODS: Twenty-three single-nucleotide polymorphisms within 6 genes involved in repair and degenerative processes (DEFB1, DENND2C, ESRRB, FGF3, FGF10, and FGFR1) were investigated in 410 patients, 203 with a diagnosis of RCD and 207 presenting with absence of RCD. Exclusion criteria were patients older than 60 years and younger than 45 years with a history of trauma, rheumatoid arthritis, autoimmune syndrome, pregnancy, and use of corticosteroids. Genomic DNA was obtained from saliva samples. Genetic markers were genotyped with TaqMan real-time polymerase chain reaction. The chi(2) test compared genotypes and haplotype differences between groups. Multivariate logistic regression analyzed the significance of many covariates and the incidence of RCD. RESULTS: Statistical analysis revealed female sex (P = .001; odds ratio, 2.07 [1.30-3.30]) and being white (P = .002; odds ratio, 1.88 [1.21-2.90]) to be risk factors for RCD development. A significant association of haplotypes CCTTCCAG in ESRRB (P = .05), CGACG in FGF3 (P = .01), CC in DEFB1 (P = .03), and FGFR1 rs13317 (P = .02) with RCD could be observed. Also, association between FGF10 rs11750845 (P = .03) and rs1011814 (P = .01) was observed after adjustment by ethnic group and sex. CONCLUSIONS: Our work clearly supports the role of DEFB1, ESRRB, FGF3, FGF10, and FGFR1 genes in RCD. Identification of these variants can clarify causal pathways and provide a clue for therapeutic targets. Copyright © 2014 Journal of Shoulder and Elbow Surgery Board of Trustees.

        "Abstract":"IMPORTANCE OF THE FIELD: The treatment of rheumatoid arthritis has changed dramatically over the past 25 years, first with the introduction of methotrexate and then the introduction of biologic therapy. These agents have provided patients with multiple treatment options to try to achieve disease remission. Unfortunately, no one single agent is fully effective in every patient; different patients respond to different therapies, even those with the same mechanism of action, in different ways. Another medication, such as certolizumab pegol, is a welcome addition to our treatment armamentarium of rheumatoid arthritis. AREAS COVERED IN THIS REVIEW: The basis of this review is all the peer-reviewed manuscripts found in PubMed and Medline searches from 1990 to 2009 and abstracts on certolizumab pegol presented at the American College of Rheumatology and European League Against Rheumatism within the past 5 years. WHAT THE READER WILL GAIN: This review should enable the reader to fully understand the benefit:risk ratio of certolizumab pegol in the treatment of rheumatoid arthritis. TAKE HOME MESSAGE: Certolizumab pegol is an effective agent either in combination with methotrexate or as monotherapy in the treatment of rheumatoid arthritis with a safety profile similar to other approved TNF inhibitors.

        "Published":"2015 Jul",
        "Abstract":"OBJECTIVE: To analyze sex difference in the effect of smoking on remission proportions in patients with rheumatoid arthritis (RA). METHODS: Subjects were Japanese patients with RA who participated in the IORRA survey conducted in April 2011 and reported smoking status. Clinical characteristics, treatment status, and the percentages achieving remission were compared between subjects stratified by sex and smoking status. To confirm the differential effects of sex and smoking status on remission, we used multivariate logistic regression models with the dependent variable as 28-joint Disease Activity Score (DAS28) remission. RESULTS: Among 810 men and 4206 women, 162 (20.0%) and 3173 (75.4%), respectively, were never smokers; 208 (25.7%) and 314 (7.5%), respectively, were current smokers. In men, never smokers tended to have higher remission proportions than past and current smokers. In contrast, smoking status seemed not to affect remission in women. Except for lower corticosteroid dose in male never smokers, no significant differences were observed in comparing treatment status. By multivariate analyses, male past and current smokers were negatively associated with DAS28-erythrocyte sedimentation rate remission compared to male never smokers [OR 0.66 and 0.61, 95% CI (0.44-0.98) and (0.39-0.96), respectively]. However, female past and current smokers were not associated with remission compared to female never smokers [OR 1.04 and 1.19, 95% CI (0.86-1.25) and (0.91-1.54), respectively]. CONCLUSION: We demonstrated that the effect of smoking on remission proportions differed between men and women. Our findings suggest that both sex and smoking status are important considerations when planning a treatment strategy for patients with RA.",

        "Abstract":"Rituximab (RTX) is a chimeric anti-CD20 antibody, approved for rheumatoid arthritis (RA) patients who failed anti-Tumor Necrosis Factor therapy. It has been used occasionally for life-threatening autoimmune diseases (AID). We report our center experience in the use of RTX in life-threatening complications or refractory AID. Clinical charts of patients treated with RTX at our center were reviewed, cases treated for life-threatening complications or refractory AID were analyzed. Acute damage to vital organs such as lung, heart, kidney, nervous system with severe functional impairment were defined as life-threatening complications; treatment failure with high-dose corticosteroids, cyclophosphamide, IVIG, plasmapheresis was defined as refractory autoimmune disease. During the years 2003-2009, 117 patients were treated with RTX, most of them for RA. Nine patients (6 females, mean age 51.5 years, mean disease duration 6.3 years) answered the criteria. The indications were as follows: pulmonary hemorrhage (1 patient with cryoglobulinemic vasculitis, 1 with systemic sclerosis, 1 with ANCA-associated vasculitis), catastrophic anti-phospholipid syndrome (2 SLE patients), non-bacterial endocarditis and pulmonary hypertension (1 patient with mixed connective tissue disease), vasculitis and feet necrosis (1 patient with systemic lupus erythematosus), severe lupus demyelinative neuropathy and acute renal failure (1 patient), and severe rheumatoid lung disease with recurrent empyema and pneumothorax (1 patient). B cell depletion was achieved in all patients. The median time since starting of complications to RTX administration was 3 weeks (range 2-15 weeks). Complete remission (suppression of the hazardous situation and return to previous stable state) was seen in 7 out of 9 patients. Partial remission (significant improvement) was achieved in the remained. The median time to response was 3 weeks (range 1-8 weeks), mean follow-up 47.2 months (range 6-60 months). A rapid tapering off of steroids was achieved in all patients. Two patients relapsed and were successfully retreated with RTX: the patient with severe RA lung relapsed after 3 years, one of the patients with ANCA-associated pulmonary alveolar hemorrhage relapsed after 10 months. There were no side effects during RTX infusion. Two episodes of serious infections were registered: fatal Gram-negative sepsis 6 months after RTX treatment, and septic discitis 4 months after receiving RTX. RTX serves as a safe, efficient, and prompt rescue therapy in certain life-threatening conditions and resistant to aggressive immunosuppression AID. RTX when administrated at an earlier stage, prevented irreversible vital organ damage, and allowed rapid steroid tapering off in already severe immunodepressed patients.",

Early diagnosis and treatment with disease-modifying antirheumatic drugs (DMARDs) are necessary to reduce early joint damage, functional loss, and mortality. Several clinical trials have now clearly shown that administering appropriate DMARDs early yields better therapeutic outcomes. However, RA is a heterogeneous disease in which responses to treatment vary considerably for any given patient. Thus, choosing which patients receive combination DMARDs, and which combinations, remains one of our major challenges in treating RA patients. In many well controlled clinical trials methotrexate and other DMARDs, including the tumor necrosis factor-alpha inhibitors, have shown considerable efficacy in controlling the inflammatory process, but many patients continue to have active disease. Optimizing clinical response requires the use of a full spectrum of clinical agents with different therapeutic targets. Newer therapies, such as rituximab, that specifically target B cells have emerged as viable treatment options for patients with RA. [References: 25]",

        "Abstract":"OBJECTIVE: To evaluate toxicity profiles in patients with rheumatoid arthritis (RA) treated either according to an intensive or a conventional treatment strategy approach with methotrexate (MTX) and to study factors associated with MTX-related toxicity. METHODS: Data were used from the Computer-Assisted Management in Early Rheumatoid Arthritis (CAMERA) study, in which clinical efficacy of an intensive treatment strategy with MTX was more beneficial than a conventional treatment strategy approach. In this study, data on adverse events (AEs) were compared between the two strategy groups. Logistic regression analyses were used to identify possible associations between factors assessed at baseline and withdrawal due to MTX-related AEs or liver toxicity at follow-up. RESULTS: Although significantly more patients in the intensive strategy group experienced MTX-related AEs than in the conventional strategy group, all recorded AEs were relatively mild. A higher body mass index (BMI) was significantly associated with withdrawal due to MTX-related AEs in the multiple regression analyses (odds ratio=1.207, 95% confidence interval 1.02 to 1.44, p=0.033). There was a trend towards an association between diminished creatinine clearance and MTX withdrawal. For liver toxicity, increased serum liver enzymes at baseline were associated with liver toxicity during follow-up. CONCLUSION: Although the occurrence of AEs in the intensive strategy group was higher than in the conventional strategy group, the previously observed clinical efficacy of an intensive treatment strategy seems to outweigh the observed toxicity profiles. When starting MTX, attention should be given to patients with a high BMI and those with increased levels of liver enzymes and decreased renal function.",

        "Abstract":"OBJECTIVES: To evaluate the effectiveness and safety of tocilizumab in RA patients in clinical practice. METHODS: We observed 232 consecutive RA patients who began tocilizumab in three rheumatology centres in Japan for 52 weeks. Clinical, radiographic and functional status and safety were evaluated. RESULTS: Mean age of the 232 patients was 59.1 years, mean duration of disease was 12.4 years and average DAS using the 28-joint count (DAS-28) was 5.6. Although 62.8% of the patients had been treated previously with anti-TNF biologics, clinical remission at Week 52 was achieved in 43.7%, radiographic non-progression in 62.8% and functional remission in 26.4%. Retention rate at Week 52 was 71.1%, and the same for those with or without previous anti-TNF treatment. Adverse drug reactions leading to tocilizumab discontinuation were observed in 15.5% of patients, the most frequent adverse drug reaction being pneumonia in eight cases. On multivariate logistic regression analysis, DAS-28, HAQ-disability index (HAQ-DI), concomitant MTX and concomitant glucocorticoids (GCs) were predictive variables for clinical remission at Week 52 of tocilizumab treatment. In particular, HAQ-DI was found to be a predictive variable for remission of all three types-clinical, radiographic and functional-at Week 52 of tocilizumab treatment. CONCLUSIONS: In daily clinical practice, tocilizumab exhibited excellent effectiveness in established RA patients, some of whom had failed to respond to previous anti-TNF treatment. Although further detailed safety findings are required, this study provides valuable real-world findings on the management of RA with tocilizumab.",

Two hundred twenty-two patients with recent onset RA and undifferentiated arthritis in the IMPROVED study filled out the Beck Depression Inventory (BDI-II) to assess depressive symptoms severity and the Life Orientation Test Revised (LOT-R) to measure optimism before and after 4 months of treatment. All patients were treated with methotrexate 25 mg\/week and prednisone 60 mg\/day (tapered to 7.5 mg\/day in 7 weeks). Linear regression analysis was used to assess the association between the disease activity score (DAS) and its components (tender joint count, general well-being measured with a visual analogue scale (VAS), swollen joint count, and erythrocyte sedimentation rate) with the BDI-II an LOT-R scores. In general, depressive symptoms were mild. The DAS was an independent predictor of depressive symptoms scores both at baseline and after 4 months follow-up, in particular tender joint count and VAS global health. Disease activity was not associated with the level of optimism. Nevertheless, patients who achieved clinical remission improved significantly more in both depression score and optimism score than patients who did not. Patients with early arthritis report improvement in depressive symptoms and optimism with improvement in disease activity and achieving clinical remission. Depression scores are associated with pain and unwell being but not with swollen joint counts and inflammatory parameters.",

Cell surface expression and transcripts of Sema4D were analyzed in peripheral blood cells from RA patients, and immunohistochemical staining of Sema4D was performed in RA synovium. Generation of sSema4D was evaluated in an ADAMTS-4-treated monocytic cell line (THP-1 cells). The efficacy of anti-Sema4D antibody was evaluated in mice with collagen-induced arthritis (CIA). RESULTS: Levels of sSema4D were elevated in both serum and synovial fluid from RA patients, and disease activity markers were correlated with serum sSema4D levels. Sema4D-expressing cells also accumulated in RA synovium. Cell surface levels of Sema4D on CD3+ and CD14+ cells from RA patients were reduced, although levels of Sema4D transcripts were unchanged. In addition, ADAMTS-4 cleaved cell surface Sema4D to generate sSema4D in THP-1 cells. Soluble Sema4D induced tumor necrosis factor alpha (TNFalpha) and interleukin-6 (IL-6) production from CD14+ monocytes. IL-6 and TNFalpha induced ADAMTS-4 expression in synovial cells. Treatment with an anti-Sema4D antibody suppressed arthritis and reduced proinflammatory cytokine production in CIA. CONCLUSION: A positive feedback loop involving sSema4D\/IL-6 and TNFalpha\/ADAMTS-4 may contribute to the pathogenesis of RA. The inhibition of arthritis by anti-Sema4D antibody suggests that Sema4D represents a potential therapeutic target for RA. Copyright © 2015 The Authors.

        "Published":"2015 Sep",
        "Abstract":"OBJECTIVE: To evaluate disease activity trends in a large cohort of Australian patients with rheumatoid arthritis (RA) from 2009 to 2014. METHODS: This is a multicenter, cross-sectional, noninterventional study of patients with RA treated in Australia. Patients with RA treated at participating OPAL (Optimising Patient outcome in Australian RheumatoLogy) clinics were included in the study. Data, deidentified by patient, clinic, and clinician, were identified using a purpose-written electronic medical record. Patient demographics, disease onset, medications, and disease measures were analyzed. The Disease Activity Score at 28 joints (DAS28) was used to classify patients into the disease activity states of remission: low disease activity, moderate disease activity (MDA), and high disease activity. Choice of therapy was at the discretion of the treating clinician. RESULTS: At the time of analysis, the database contained 15,679 patients with RA, 8998 of whom fulfilled the inclusion criteria. Mean age was 63.2 years, mean disease duration was 13.8 years, and the majority were women (72.4%). A total of 37,274 individual DAS28-erythrocyte sedimentation rate scores were recorded for the 8998 patients. The frequency of remission increased significantly from 36.7% in 2009 to 53.5% in 2014 (p < 0.001), and that of MDA decreased from 33% (2009) to 22.2% (2014). The use of biologic disease-modifying antirheumatic drugs for the patients in remission increased from 17% in 2009 to 36.9% in 2014. CONCLUSION: Contemporary management of RA in Australia shows improvements in disease activity toward the target of remission over a 5-year period.",

        "Abstract":"Although biologic agents are most well established as part of combination regimens in patients with RA, biologic monotherapy is common in clinical practice. To date, few double-blind, randomized clinical trials have compared biologic monotherapy with MTX monotherapy. Five randomized double-blind trials evaluating the TNF antagonists etanercept (ERA and TEMPO), adalimumab (PREMIER) and golimumab (GO-BEFORE) and the IL-6 receptor antagonist tocilizumab (AMBITION) were identified. We noted considerable variation in patient characteristics (i.e. disease duration and disease severity) in the five trials. Studies involving monotherapy with TNF inhibitors found no clear clinical efficacy advantage over MTX monotherapy. In the two trials that included a TNF inhibitor\/MTX combination arm, combination therapy was superior to monotherapy with either agent alone. In contrast, the AMBITION trial demonstrated that tocilizumab monotherapy was superior to MTX in terms of clinical response, disease activity, remission and functionality. Although results cannot be compared across clinical trials, tocilizumab was the only biologic agent to demonstrate superiority to MTX as monotherapy in patients with RA with limited\/no exposure to MTX.",

        "Published":"2015 Jan",
        "Abstract":"PURPOSE OF REVIEW: Interleukin (IL)-23 and the related cytokine IL-17 play vital roles in immune-mediated inflammatory pathology. In the years since its discovery, IL-23 has been implicated as a central pathogenic factor in multiple rheumatic conditions and has been shown to act via a wide range of immune cells including type 17 T-helper (Th17) cells and innate-like immune cells. We review here the pivotal role of these cytokines and IL-23-responsive cells in both the bona fide autoimmune rheumatic diseases rheumatoid arthritis and systemic lupus erythematosus, as well as the spondyloarthropathies which more closely resemble the auto-inflammatory conditions. RECENT FINDINGS: IL-23 and related cytokines have been found to be up-regulated in rheumatoid arthritis, systemic lupus erythematosus and spondyloarthropathy, and preclinical models suggest that they play important pathological roles in these conditions. SUMMARY: It is anticipated that agents which target the IL-23 pathway will have profound roles in modifying the natural history of these diseases and in preventing the structural damage which occurs secondary to such chronic inflammation. This is especially relevant in the case of spondyloarthropathy in which case prevention of the novel bone formation is a particular challenge. It is also potentially pertinent for patients with rheumatoid arthritis, particularly those who do not respond to other biological therapies.",

        "Abstract":"OBJECTIVES: To assess long-term drug survival and effectiveness in biological drug-naive patients with rheumatoid arthritis (RA), starting infliximab as first treatment, in the period 2000-2009, comparing different calendar years. METHODS: Patients with RA recorded in the GISEA registry beginning infliximab as first ever biological drug were enrolled, subdivided into periods 2000-2002, 2003-2005, and 2006-2009. We evaluated 5-year drug survival by Kaplan-Meier life analysis and 1-year EULAR responses based on the 28 joint count Disease Activity Score (DAS28), and baseline predictors, by multiple logistic regression analysis. RESULTS: Of 565 RA patients included in the analysis, 290 (51.3%) began infliximab in years 2000-2002, 167 (29.5%) in 2003-2005, and 108 (19.1%) in 2006-2009. At entry, DAS28-ESR was significantly lower in 2006-2009 (5.1 +\/- 1.3) than in 2000-2002 (6.0 +\/- 1.2) or 2003-2006 (6.0 +\/- 1.0) (p=0.001). Significantly more RA patients attained a EULAR \"good\" response at 1 year in 2006-2009 (39.8%) than in 2000-2002 (23.1%, p=0.001). Nevertheless, the rate of drug survival at 5 years, roughly 40%, was not significantly different over the calendar periods. Co-administration of DMARDs was significantly correlated with drug survival (Odds Ratio (OR) 1.42, 95% Confidence Intervals (CI) 1.005-2.09, p=0.04), but not the period when starting treatment. Instead, a EULAR \"good\" response was significantly correlated with the period 2006-2009 (OR 2.24, 95% CI 1.37-3.65, p=0.02). CONCLUSIONS: Our study shows that RA patients have similar drug survival on infliximab regardless of the period when they started. However, patients treated in more recent years tend to have less active RA and to more readily attain favourable clinical outcomes.",

        "Abstract":"OBJECTIVE: To determine the comparative efficacy and tolerability of abatacept and tumor necrosis factor inhibitors (TNFi) in patients with rheumatoid arthritis (RA) and inadequate response to conventional disease modifying anti-rheumatic drugs (DMARDs). RESEARCH DESIGN AND METHODS: A systematic review identified RCTs in RA patients who responded inadequately to conventional DMARDs and were treated with one of the following biologic agents: abatacept, adalimumab, etanercept, infliximab, certolizumab pegol, or golimumab. Bayesian hierarchical models were used to compare efficacy and tolerability outcomes of abatacept and combined TNFi at 6 months and 1 year. RESULTS: In this mixed treatment comparison (MTC), the likelihood of achieving ACR response was comparable between abatacept and combined TNFi at 6 months for ACR20, 50, and 70: (odds ratio [OR] = 0.98 [95% confidence interval (CI): 0.73, 1.27], 0.99 [0.73, 1.31], and 0.91 [0.62, 1.27], respectively); and at 12 months for ACR20 (OR = 1.27 [0.92, 1.71]) and ACR50 (1.21 [0.82, 1.68]), with a higher likelihood of achieving an ACR70 response at 12 months (1.41 [1.02, 1.82]). Odds of DAS28 remission at 12 months was greater for abatacept than the combined TNFi (OR = 2.03 [1.04, 3.58]). Abatacept had better tolerability, defined as a lower likelihood of withdrawal due to adverse events, at both 6 and 12 months (OR = 0.38 [0.10, 0.88] and 0.51 [0.27, 0.86], respectively). These analyses include indirect comparisons across clinical trials and are not a replacement for head-to-head data. While all TNFi have been grouped into one class, there may be some differences between the individual TNFi that are not captured in our study. CONCLUSIONS: In this MTC, abatacept demonstrated similar efficacy at 6 months, a higher likelihood of achieving ACR70 response and DAS28 remission at 12 months and better tolerability relative to the combined TNFi in patients with RA who had an inadequate response to conventional DMARDs.",

        "Abstract":"OBJECTIVE: To investigate the results and feasibility of available scales to measure minimal disease activity (MDA) and remission in rheumatoid arthritis (RA) in the clinic. METHODS: We studied 849 consecutive patients with RA seen in a community rheumatology practice for routine RA care by 4 rheumatologists, beginning in March 2007 and ending in August 2007. Patients and physicians completed a simple form at each visit. We calculated the Disease Activity Score 28 (DAS28), Clinical Disease Activity Index (CDAI), physician assessment of global activity, and the Patient Activity Scale (PAS-II). From these we calculated remission and MDA prevalence in this community practice. RESULTS: The DAS28 could not be determined in more than 50% of patients because of referring physician and insurance company restrictions. Remission prevalences differed by assessment method: DAS28 28.5%, CDAI 6.5%-8.1%, physician global 12.5%, PAS 13.7%. MDA was 26.9% using the American College of Rheumatology core set variables, 34.7% using the DAS28, and 26.8% using the PAS-II. The kappa statistic was only fair (0.2 to 0.4) for most comparisons between assessment methods. No significant differences were noted for remission and MDA according to biologic therapy. CONCLUSION: The CDAI and\/or physician global and PAS-II are simple acceptable ways to measure RA activity in the clinic, but results differ strikingly according to method. Further standardization appears to be required for full implementation of the CDAI. Caution is urged before using these methods for regulatory purposes.",

        "Abstract":"OBJECTIVE: To study prospectively the daily practice effectiveness of a step-down early rheumatoid arthritis (RA) treatment strategy. METHODS: Patients with severe RA and no contra-indications were proposed step-down therapy, the others step-up. Step-down patients received a modified combination therapy in early RA (COBRA) regimen: sulphasalazine (SPS), 2 g daily, and methotrexate (MTX), 15 mg weekly, combined with step-down oral prednisolone (start 60 mg daily, fast tapering to 7.5 mg over 6 weeks, discontinuation from week 28). At week 40, patients were randomized to maintenance therapy with either SPS or MTX if disease activity score-28 (DAS28) was acceptably low. The step-up group started disease-modifying anti-rheumatic drug (DMARD) monotherapy. In both groups, treatment was adjusted at follow-up, based on DAS28. DAS28, functionality Health Assessment Questionnaire (HAQ), adverse events, DMARD changes and steroid use were registered 4-monthly for 2 yrs. RESULTS: Nineteen patients received step-down and 52 step-up treatment. More patients completed the first year without unplanned DMARD changes and without dosage adjustment and fewer had DMARD changes due to side effects or inefficacy in the step-down group compared with step-up, whereas the number of adverse events was comparable. MTX proved to be the most effective maintenance therapy after step-down. The DAS response, proportion of patients in remission, HAQ response and proportion of patients without disability at 4 months was higher in the step-down group. CONCLUSIONS: In daily practice, a step-down treatment strategy for early RA is more effective than a step-up approach.",

METHODS: Patients with recent-onset rheumatoid arthritis receiving traditional antirheumatic therapy from either the BeSt study, a randomised controlled trial comparing different treatment strategies (group A), or two Early Arthritis Clinics (group B) were included. In group A, systematic DAS-driven treatment adjustments aimed to achieve low disease activity (DAS < or =2.4). In group B, treatment was left to the discretion of the treating doctor. Functional ability (Health Assessment Questionnaire (HAQ)), Disease Activity Score in 28 joints (DAS28) and Sharp\/van der Heijde radiographic score (SHS) were evaluated. RESULTS: At baseline, patients in group A (n = 234) and group B (n = 201) had comparable demographic characteristics and a mean HAQ of 1.4. Group A had a longer median disease duration than group B (0.5 vs 0.4 years, p = 0.016), a higher mean DAS28 (6.1 vs 5.7, p<0.001), more rheumatoid factor-positive patients (66% vs 42%, p<0.001) and more patients with erosions (71% vs 53%, p<0.001). After 1 year, the HAQ improvement was 0.7 vs 0.5 (p = 0.029), and the percentage in remission (DAS28 <2.6) 31% vs 18% (p<0.005) in groups A and B, respectively. In group A, the median SHS progression was 2.0 (expected progression 7.0), in group B, the SHS progression was 1.0 (expected progression 4.4).

        "Abstract":"A period of 4 weeks (w) has been recommended for rheumatoid arthritis (RA) patients as the interval between intravenous (IV) tocilizumab (TCZ, 8 mg\/kg). In a previous paper, we showed the possibility that the interval between successive IV TCZ can be extended from 4 to 6 weeks in more than 60% of patients with low diseases activity (LDA) at 4-week intervals. Herein, we aimed to investigate the efficacy and safety of extending the interval from 4 to 6 weeks. A retrospective observational study was conducted by enrolling patients in whom the intervals of TCZ infusions could be extended from 4 to 6 weeks with an LDA for more than 2 years. We compared the efficacy and side effects of TCZ infusions at intervals of 4 and 6 weeks in a cohort of patients. We also examined serum lipid, platelet, IL-6, and trough TCZ levels. A total of 125 patients with an LDA at 4 weeks intervals were enrolled in this study, of which 78 patients maintained LDA at 6-week intervals of TCZ infusion. After extending the infusion intervals, the efficacy of the treatment was maintained, and the side effects decreased significantly. In addition, the levels of total cholesterol and triglyceride were returned to normal, and the serum trough levels of TCZ became undetectable at 6-week intervals. We proved that intervals between TCZ infusions can be extended from 4 to 6 weeks in more than 60% of RA patients along with a decrease in the side effects, thus suggesting the need to change the infusion intervals in suitable patients.",

In this study, the immunohistological features in synovial membrane obtained from apparently uninvolved knee joints of 16 patients with active untreated rheumatoid arthritis were examined and compared to tissue from control subjects. Synovial tissue was obtained by needle biopsy. Hyperplasia of the synovial lining layer, present in 69%, was the most frequently observed abnormality in synovium obtained from uninvolved joints. Perivascular mononuclear cell infiltration was present in 31% and consisted predominantly of helper T-cells. Increased vascularity and fibrin deposition were not notable features. Clinically overt synovitis emerged in only two patients during a follow-up period of up to 36 months. In conclusion, a considerable degree of histological change was observed in the apparently uninvolved knee joints of patients with active rheumatoid arthritis. The presence of subclinical synovitis challenges current concepts of disease activity and clinical remission. Further study is required to determine whether the features described may be associated with progressive joint erosion.",

        "Abstract":"OBJECTIVE: To evaluate the progression of erosions and joint space narrowing (JSN) in feet and hands in the U-Act-Early trial. METHODS: In this trial, 317 newly diagnosed DMARD-naive RA patients initiated randomly tocilizumab, or step-up MTX or a combination of the two. Radiographs were scored at baseline and after 52 and 104 weeks using the Sharp-van der Heijde erosion and JSN score. Between the strategy arms, changes from baseline and the proportions of patients without radiographic progression (change from baseline <=0) were compared. RESULTS: Mean changes from baseline in erosion and JSN scores for the whole study population were after 52 weeks 0.59 and 0.18 and after 104 weeks 0.70 and 0.50, respectively. For JSN, at both time points no differences in progression were found between strategies (P  0.09). For erosions, the progression was significantly lower at week 104 in both tocilizumab arms when compared with the MTX arm ((p<=0.023). Less progression of erosions in the feet was found after 104 weeks in both tocilizumab arms (P  0.046); this was not significant for the hands (P  0.11). The proportion of patients without progression in erosions was higher in the tocilizumab arms at week 52 (tocilizumab plus MTX: 87%, P = 0.038; tocilizumab: 81%, P = 0.29) and 104 (tocilizumab plus MTX: 85%, P = 0.001; tocilizumab: 77%, P = 0.028), compared with the MTX arm (74 and 60%, respectively). CONCLUSION: In DMARD-naive early RA patients, initiating a tocilizumab-based treat-to-target strategy inhibits the progression of erosions, especially in the feet, more compared with initiation of a step-up MTX strategy.

        "Published":"2005 Oct",
        "Abstract":"BACKGROUND: Pemphigus, a common immunobullous disease of skin and mucous membranes affecting both sexes of all ages, was almost fatal before the advent of corticosteroids. Better strategies to avoid their side-effects and recent introduction of adjuvant therapy has further improved its prognosis. As the treatment remains need-based and patient-specific, different regimens and strategies have evolved, each with its own merits and demerits. This retrospective hospital-based study was carried out to understand the clinico-therapeutic aspects of pemphigus in our clinic. METHODS: Medical records of all new patients admitted to our hospital with the diagnosis of pemphigus from 1990 to 2002 were analyzed. The diagnosis was mainly clinical and confirmed by positive Tzanck's test and histopathology. All patients were assessed clinically on a severity score of 1+ to 4+. These patients had received treatment with dexamethasone-cyclophosphamide pulse (DCP) therapy, oral mini-pulse (OMP) with betamethasone, or intramuscular triamcinolone acetonide alone or with azathioprine, dapsone or cyclophosphamide. They were followed up for clinical remission and side-effects of therapy. RESULTS: There were a total of 54 new patients comprising 53.7% females and 46.3% males, and 12.9% of these were < 18 years of age. Pemphigus vulgaris was the commonest clinical type seen in 81.48% and mucosal involvement was seen in 63.63% of cases. The severity of mucosal lesions was not proportionate to that of cutaneous lesions. Associated diseases seen were seropositive rheumatoid arthritis, hypertension, diabetes mellitus and hyperthyroidism in one case each. Dexamethasone-cyclophosphamide pulse therapy was given to 75% of the pemphigus vulgaris patients while those having less severe disease were treated with other regimens. In general, clinical remission was seen after 2-16 (mean 6.5) DCP doses. Two patients have been in complete remission for the last 5 and 7 years of completion of DCP therapy, respectively. Addition of other adjuvants to corticosteroids was also helpful. However, azathioprine 50 mg\/day was not as effective as cyclophosphamide 50 mg\/day. Menstrual irregularities, amenorrhoea, azoospermia, rise in blood pressure and glycosuria were the major side-effects seen during DCP pulse therapy. Drop out rate was unacceptably high with all modes of treatment, although with DCP therapy it appears to be partly owing to early disease control. There was no mortality in this series. CONCLUSIONS: Pemphigus vulgaris is the commonest clinical type. Mucosal surfaces other than the oral cavity are uncommonly involved, it may herald the onset of disease and takes longer to heal. Dexamethasone-cyclophosphamide pulse therapy seems to have a definite advantage over treatment with steroids alone, especially in terms of better control of disease activity, near absence of steroid side-effects and significantly reduced hospital stay. However, ways and means to reduce gonadal toxicity of adjuvants need to be explored as DCP therapy is likely to stay as a treatment of choice.",

        "Abstract":"OBJECTIVE: Determine healthcare resource utilization (HCRU) in biologic-naive initiators of TNF inhibitors (TNFis) associated with their disease activity from a national cohort of rheumatoid arthritis (RA) patients. METHODS: RA patients were identified at their first TNFi initiation (index date) in the Corrona registry. Patients with age of RA onset <18, comorbid psoriasis\/psoriatic arthritis, fibromyalgia, or osteoarthritis were excluded. Patients were categorized into disease activity (DA) strata by the lowest level of DA (and sustaining low levels for at least two visits) using the Clinical Disease Activity Index (CDAI) across all visits in Corrona while on a TNFi during 1 year after initiation. Rates of all-cause and RA-related hospitalizations, rheumatologist visits, and joint surgeries while on TNFi therapy were reported and compared across DA levels along with the incidence rate ratio (IRR) adjusted for age, gender, and RA duration using Poisson mixed models. RESULTS: Of 1931 RA patients: 15% achieved sustained remission, 22% remission, 14% sustained low DA, 23% low DA and 27% moderate\/high DA (M\/HDA). Those in M\/HDA had statistically higher rates of hospitalizations (37.3 per 100 patient years (py), 95% CI: 31.6-43.7 and joint surgeries (20.8 per 100 py, 95% CI: 16.6-25.8) compared to the sustained remission cohort, resulting in respective IRRs of 2.3 (p < 0.001) and 1.7 (p = 0.046). CONCLUSION: Many biologic naive RA patients initiating TNFi failed to achieve sustained remission during a 1 year period while remaining on TNFi therapy. Patients in higher DA levels had higher HCRU rates vs. patients in sustained remission, suggesting that achieving treat-to-target goals would reduce health care expenses.",

        "Abstract":"We identified 68 patients with clonal T-large granular lymphocyte (T-LGL) proliferations who were seen at the Mayo Clinic between 1984 and 1992. Nineteen (28%) were asymptomatic at diagnosis, while the rest experienced fatigue (60%), B-symptoms (12%), and recurrent infections (15%). Associated comorbid conditions included rheumatoid arthritis (RA) in 26%. Severe anemia (hemoglobin [Hb] < 8g\/dL) and neutopenia (absolute neutrophil count [ANC] < 500\/microL) were seen in 19% and 40% of patients, respectively. Immunophenotypic studies showed CD3+, CD8+ phenotype in the majority (72%). Twenty-one patients (31%) have required no therapy, and remain relatively stable with a median follow-up period of 50 months. Treatment was required at either diagnosis (36 patients) or at subsequent follow-up (11 patients). Initial response rates were similar in patients treated with cyclophosphamide (CTX) with or without prednisone (69%), or prednisone alone (73%). Overall, 61 patients (90%) are alive with a median follow-up of 44 months. Actuarial median survival of this entire cohort is 161 months. The presence of anemia or symptoms does not appear to correlate with the tumor burden. In patients requiring therapy, a lower ANC and the presence of B-symptoms\/infection were independently associated with a significantly lower probability of achieving a molecular or hematologic complete remission (H-CR). Intermittent immunosuppressive therapy is effective in achieving durable responses in a number of patients. T-LGL proliferations are associated with a favorable prognosis and response to therapy. However, significant heterogeneity exists in clinical presentation and associated comorbid conditions. These disorders should be included in the differential diagnosis of patients with unexplained cytopenias, particularly in the setting of RA and other autoimmune disorders. Analogous to the situation with monoclonal gammopathies, a term such as T-cell clonopathy of undetermined significance (TCUS) may be more appropriate to describe these patients.",

        "Published":"2012 Sep",
        "Abstract":"Patient overall satisfaction with health (PSH) was measured by a subset of questions from the Arthritis Impact Measurement Scales II. Based on longitudinal observations for 267 early rheumatoid arthritis (RA) patients of the United States Western Consortium (WC) cohort receiving first non-biologic DMARD treatment, we estimated the 1-year change in PSH (DELTA PSH). Logistic regression analysis was used to estimate the association of improvement in DELTA PSH with the core set of clinical and patient-reported components of disease activity scores (DAS). Most patients were more satisfied with health after 1 year of treatment (80%); few achieved DAS28-ESR minimal disease activity (27%) or remission (7%). Laboratory and joint count measures were not associated with improved 12-month PSH. Patients with greater HAQ-DI (P = 0.0473) and self-reported stiffness (P = 0.0669) were more likely to have a perceived overall health benefit from treatment. Regardless of objective disease status, patients are generally satisfied with first-line treatment, which could present a challenge to implementing DAS-guided treatment change. Patients with greater self-reported functional limitations might have lower expectations for treatment benefit and be less willing to modify their current therapy; subjective assessments of function and stiffness could be particularly useful in identifying these patients.",

The analysis included 578 patients with pemphigus from 30 studies. Seventy-six percent of patients achieved complete remission (CR) after 1 cycle of RTX. Mean time to remission was 5.8 months, with a remission duration of 14.5 months and a 40% relapse rate. Eighteen patients (3.3%) developed serious adverse effects. The pooled estimate showed no significant differences in CR and relapse rates between patients treated with high-dose (near or >= 2,000 mg\/cycle) vs. low-dose (< 1,500 mg\/cycle) RTX. In the fully adjusted analysis, high-dose RTX was associated with longer duration of CR compared with low-dose RTX. No superiority of lymphoma protocol over rheumatoid arthritis or high-dose RTX over low-dose RTX was shown in other outcomes. RTX treatment is efficacious and well-tolerated in treating pemphigus. High-dose RTX treatment may lead to longer duration of remission. However, the choice of optimal regimen depends on the overall condition of the individual patient.",

        "Abstract":"BACKGROUND: To assess whether, in the real world of three early arthritis clinics, early referral could allow the best outcome, ie, remission, to be reached, and whether reaching the outcome was more dependent on therapy than on disease duration or vice versa. METHODS: 1795 patients with early arthritis (symptom duration<=12 months) were entered into a prospective follow-up study. 711 patients (39.6%) were diagnosed with rheumatoid arthritis (RA). Each RA patient was treated according to the local algorithm, in three tertiary referral centres (representing a small province, a medium sized province and a metropolitan area, respectively). Remission, defined using the disease activity score in 28 joints (DAS28<2.6) and American College of Rheumatology (ACR) criteria, was the major outcome evaluated at the 12-month follow-up. RESULTS: DAS28 remission was achieved in 34.3% (range 19.5-49%) of RA patients and ACR remission in 15.2% (range 8.5-20.6%). At the multivariate logistic regression analysis only two variables emerged as predictors of the major outcome: being in very early rheumatoid arthritis (VERA; less than 12 weeks symptom duration at the time of first treatment) and being on disease-modifying antirheumatic drugs (DMARD) within 3 months from disease onset. Among RA patients in remission, only 10% of VERA subjects received an anti-TNF blocker compared with 32.2% of non-VERA patients (p=0.002, OR 0.23, 95% CI 0.09 to 0.64). CONCLUSIONS: In a real-world setting, the 12 weeks disease duration and an early intervention with DMARD represent the most significant opportunities to reach the major outcome, ie, remission of RA. Moreover, VERA represents a window of opportunity in terms of cost saving.",

        "Published":"2016 Oct",
        "Abstract":"OBJECTIVE: Human leucocyte antigen (HLA)-DRB1*13 alleles are associated with protection from anticitrullinated protein antibody (ACPA)-positive rheumatoid arthritis (RA). It is, however, unknown at which phase of disease development (seroconversion, ACPA maturation, disease onset or outcome) these alleles are most important. We therefore examined the effect of HLA-DRB1*13 on: ACPA presence (systemic autoimmunity associated with RA) in individuals with and without RA, on ACPA characteristics and on clinical outcome measures. METHODS: The effect of HLA-DRB1*13 on ACPA presence in subjects with or without RA (non-RA) was assessed in the Swedish twin registry (n=10 748). ACPA characteristics were studied in patients with ACPA-positive RA from the Swedish Epidemiological Investigation of RA (EIRA, n=1224) and the Dutch Leiden Early Arthritis Clinic (EAC, n=441). Disease activity at inclusion and disease outcome (disease-modifying antirheumatic drugs (DMARD)-free sustained remission and radiographic progression) was assessed in patients with RA from the EAC. RESULTS: HLA-DRB1*13 is associated with protection from ACPA-positive RA (prevalence 16% vs 28% in ACPA-negative non-RA), but not with significant protection from ACPA in individuals without RA (prevalence: 22%, p value 0.09). HLA-DRB1*13 is associated with lower ACPA-levels (EIRA: 447 U\/ml versus 691 U\/ml, p value= 0.0002) and decreased citrullinated epitope recognition (EIRA: p<0.0001). No association between HLA-DRB1*13 and disease activity or outcome was found. CONCLUSIONS: These data indicate that HLA-DRB1*13 mainly affects the onset of ACPA-positive RA in ACPA-positive non-RA individuals. In RA, HLA-DRB1*13 influences ACPA characteristics but not the disease course. This implies that therapeutic strategies aimed at emulating the HLA-DBR1*13 protective effect may be most effective in ACPA-positive healthy individuals at risk for RA.

METHODS: This is a cross-sectional survey within Japan. We randomly selected nurses and doctors engaged in consultation of patients with rheumatoid arthritis (RA) and assessed their agreement and opinions on the feasibility of implementing EULAR recommendations, including potential barriers. RESULTS: 431 nurses and 128 doctors completed the questionnaire. For both nurses and doctors, levels of feasibility showed statistically significant lower results compared with those of agreement for all items. When compared between nurses and doctors, agreement showed no statistically significant differences, while nurses' answers were statistically significant lower for feasibility. Insufficient time, staff and knowledge, lack of established procedures and facilities, and lack of an education system for nurses were cited as barriers to the feasibility of implementing EULAR recommendations. CONCLUSIONS: This is the first survey within Japan evaluating opinions regarding EULAR recommendations for nurses' roles. We found that while agreement was high, feasibility was generally believed to be low. We recommend further research and collaboration between medical professionals in order to implement these recommendations in Japan.",

        "Published":"2012 May",
        "Abstract":"Although TNF inhibitors have dramatically improved the outcome of patients with rheumatoid arthritis, 30-40% of patients do not respond well to them and treatment needs to be changed. In an effort to discriminate good and poor responders, we focused on the change in serum and synovial fluid levels of interleukin (IL-) 33 before and after treatment with TNF inhibitors. They were also measured in synovial fluids from 17 TNF inhibitor-naive patients, and fibroblast-like synoviocytes (FLS) in-culture from 6 patients and correlated with various pro-inflammatory cytokines. Serum levels of IL-33 at 6 months after treatment decreased significantly in responders, while they did not change in non-responders. Synovial fluid levels of IL-33 in 6 patients under treatment with TNF inhibitors stayed high in 3 who were refractory and slightly elevated in 2 moderate responders, while they were undetectable in one patient under remission. Among inflammatory cytokines measured in 17 synovial fluids from TNF inhibitor-naive patients, levels of IL-33 showed a significant positive correlation only to those of IL-1beta. IL-1beta increased IL-33 expression markedly in FLS in vitro, compared to TNF-alpha. IL-1beta might be inducing RA inflammation through producing pro-inflammatory IL-33 in TNF inhibitor-hypo-responders. Sustained elevation of serum and\/or synovial levels of IL-33 may account for a poor response to TNF inhibitors, although how TNF inhibitors affect the level of IL-33 remains to be elucidated.",

        "Abstract":"1H NMR spectroscopy-based metabolic phenotyping was used to identify biomarkers in the plasma of patients with rheumatoid arthritis (RA). Forty-seven patients with RA (23 with active disease at baseline and 24 in remission) and 51 healthy subjects were evaluated during a one-year follow-up with assessments of disease activity (DAS-28) and 1H NMR spectroscopy of plasma samples. Discriminant analysis provided evidence that the metabolic profiles predicted disease severity. Cholesterol, lactate, acetylated glycoprotein, and lipid signatures were found to be candidate biomarkers for disease severity. The results also supported the link between RA and coronary artery disease. Repeated assessment using mixed linear models showed that the predictors obtained from metabolic profiles of plasma at baseline from patients with active RA were significantly different from those of patients in remission (P=0.0007). However, after 31 days of optimized therapy, the two patient groups were not significantly different (P=0.91). The metabolic profiles of both groups of RA patients were different from the healthy subjects. 1H NMR-based metabolic phenotyping of plasma samples in patients with RA is well suited for discovery of biomarkers and may be a potential approach for disease monitoring and personalized medication for RA therapy.",

        "Abstract":"OBJECTIVES: Rheumatoid arthritis (RA) patients with moderate disease activity show progression of joint damage and have impaired quality of life, physical function, work and daily activities. Little is known about management of patients with moderate RA. The aim of the study was to assess the 1-year response to anti-TNF in biologic-naive RA patients with moderate (3.2 <DAS28 <=5.1) disease activity despite DMARD treatment, in the Italian clinical practice. METHODS: The MODERATE study is a multicentre prospective, cohort non-interventional study, conducted in 19 Italian rheumatology sites. Patients with moderate RA, diagnosed according to the 2010 American College of Rheumatology (ACR)\/EULAR criteria, were enrolled if they also were aged >=18 years, had disease onset after 16 years old, moderate disease at baseline (DAS28 score >3.2 and <=5.1), and were naive to anti-TNF treatment. RESULTS: Among 157 RA patients, 93 (59%) underwent etanercept, 43 (22%) adalimumab, 26 (17%) certolizumab, 10 golimumab and 2 infliximab; 80% of patients were still in treatment after 12-month observation. One-year clinical remission was achieved by 27 RA patients (21%), reduction of DAS28 score greater than 1.2 was observed in 75 (58%) patients. Moderate and good response according to EULAR criteria was observed in 59 (46%) and 45 (35%) patients, respectively. CONCLUSIONS: Results confirm the efficacy of anti-TNF alpha also in moderate RA patients, who may achieve a substantial decrease of disease activity, and improve their quality of life. The low rate of patients achieving remission may suggest that therapeutic strategies should be more timely and aggressive.",

        "Abstract":"OBJECTIVE: To determine the socio-demographic profiles and some clinical aspects of patients with rheumatoid arthritis (RA). DESIGN: Prospective, cross-sectional study. SETTING: Ambulatory out- patient clinics of Kenyatta National Hospital (KNH), a public national and referral hospital. SUBJECTS: Out of 180 patients interviewed and examined, 60 met American College of Rheumatology (ACR) diagnostic criteria of RA. RESULTS: Of the 60 patients recruited 52 (87%) were females with male: female ratio of 1: 6.5. The mean age of patients was 41.38(+\/- 16.8) years. There were two peaks of age of occurrence, 20-29 and 40-49 years. In 75% of the study patients, one or more of metacarpophalangeal joints of the hand were involved in the disease. Other frequently involved sites were--wrists, elbows, knees, ankles and glenohumeral joints of shoulders in a symmetrical manner. Serum rheumatoid factor was positive in 78.9% while rheumatoid nodules were present in 13.3% of the study patients. A large majority of patients (88%) had active disease with 18% having mild disease, 38% moderate activity and 32% having severe disease. Only 12% of patients had disease in remission. Forty six point seven per cent (46.7%) of the study patients were on at least one Disease Modifying anti Rheumatic Drugs (DMARD) from a selection of methotrexate, sulphasalazine, hydroxychloroquine and leflunamide. The most frequent drug combination was methotrexate plus prednisolone at 30% of the study population; while 66.7% were on oral prednisolone with 25% of the study patients taking only Non-Steroidal anti Inflammatory Drugs (NSAIDS). CONCLUSION: A large majority of ambulatory patients with RA had active disease. Most of them were sub-optimally treated, especially the use of DMARDS. About two thirds were on oral steroids. Sub-optimal therapy in relatively young patients, peak 20-29 and 40-49 years is likely to impact negatively on their disease control and quality of life.",

        "Published":"2015",
        "Abstract":"UNLABELLED: The inability to match rheumatoid arthritis (RA) patients with the anti-cytokine agent most efficacious for them is a major hindrance to patients' speedy recovery and to the clinical use of anti-cytokine therapy. Identifying predictive biomarkers that can assist in matching RA patients with more suitable anti-cytokine treatment was our aim in this report. The sample consisted of 138 RA patients (naive and non-naive) who were administered tocilizumab or etanercept for a minimum of 16 weeks as a prescribed RA treatment. Pretreatment serum samples were obtained from patients and clinical measures of their disease activity were evaluated at baseline and 16 weeks after treatment commenced. Using patients' pretreatment serum, we measured 31 cytokines\/chemokines\/soluble receptors and used multiple linear regression analysis to identify biomarkers that correlated with patients' symptom levels (DAS28-CRP score) at week 16 and multiple logistic analyses for biomarkers that correlated with patients' final outcome. The results revealed that sgp130, logIL-6, logIL-8, logEotaxin, logIP-10, logVEGF, logsTNFR-I and logsTNFR-II pretreatment serum levels were predictive of the week 16 DAS28-CRP score in naive tocilizumab patients while sgp130, logGM-CSF and logIP-10 were predictive in non-naive patients. Additionally, we found logIL-9, logVEGF and logTNF-alpha to be less reliable at predicting the week 16 DAS28-CRP score in naive etanercept patients. Multiple linear regression and multiple logistic regression analyses identified biomarkers that were predictive of remission\/non-remission in tocilizumab and etanercept therapy. Although less reliable than those for tocilizumab, we identified a few possible biomarkers for etanercept therapy. The biomarkers for these two therapies differ suggesting that their efficacy will vary for individual patients. We discovered biomarkers in RA pretreatment serum that predicted their week 16 DAS28-CRP score and clinical outcome to tocilizumab therapy. Most of these biomarkers, especially sgp130, are involved in RA pathogenesis and IL-6 signal transduction, which further suggests that they are highly reliable.

        "Published":"2007",
        "Abstract":"Current treatment strategies aim to achieve clinical remission in order to prevent the long-term consequences of rheumatoid arthritis (RA). Several composite indices are available to assess remission. All of them include joint counts as the assessment of the major 'organ' involved in RA, but some employ reduced joint counts, such as the 28-joint count, which excludes ankles and feet. The aim of the present study was to determine the relevance of excluding joints of the ankles and feet in the assessment of RA disease activity and remission. Using a longitudinal observational RA dataset, we analyzed 767 patients (80% female, 60% rheumatoid factor-positive), for whom joint counts had been recorded at 2,754 visits. We determined the number of affected joints by the 28-JC and the 32-JC, the latter including ankles and combined metatarso-phalangeal joints (as a block on each side). Several findings were supportive of the validity of the 28-joint count: (a) Absence of joint swelling on the 28-joint scale had a specificity of 98.1% and a positive predictive value (PPV) of 94.1% for the absence of swelling also on the 32-joint scale. For absence of tender joints, the specificity and PPV were 96.1% and 91.7%, respectively. (b) Patients with swollen or tender joints in the 32-JC, despite no joint activity in the 28-JC, were clearly different with regard to other disease activity measures. In particular, the patient global assessment of disease activity was higher in these individuals. Thus, the difference in the joint count was not relevant for composite disease activity assessment. (c) The disease activity score based on 28 joints (DAS28) may reach levels higher than 2.6 in patients with feet swelling since these patients often have other findings that raise DAS28. (d) The frequency of remission did not change when the 28-JC was replaced by 32-JC in the composite indices. (e) The changes in joint activity over time were almost identical in longitudinal analysis. The assessment of the ankles and feet is an important part in the clinical evaluation of patients with RA. However, reduced joint counts are appropriate and valid tools for formal disease activity assessment, such as done in composite indices.",

        "Abstract":"AIMS: Tumour necrosis factor-like weak inducer of apoptosis (TWEAK) is implicated in the pathogenesis of lupus nephritis. This study evaluated the pharmacokinetics, using the population approach, and pharmacodynamics of BIIB023, an anti-TWEAK monoclonal antibody, in healthy Chinese, Japanese and Caucasian volunteers. METHODS: In this single-dose, randomized, double-blind, phase 1 study of BIIB023 in healthy volunteers, BIIB023 was administered by intravenous infusion (3 or 20 mg kg(-1) ) on Day 1; follow-up occurred through Day 71. BIIB023 serum concentration was measured using a validated enzyme-linked immunosorbent assay; BIIB023 concentration-time data were subjected to noncompartmental analysis. Population pharmacokinetic analysis was performed using data from this study and a prior phase 1 study of BIIB023 in subjects with rheumatoid arthritis. Soluble TWEAK and TWEAK: BIIB023 complex were evaluated. RESULTS: There were no differences in BIIB023 pharmacokinetics requiring dose adjustment among the three ethnic groups or between healthy volunteers and arthritis patients. BIIB023 central compartment volume (3050 ml) and clearance (7.42 ml h(-1) ) were comparable to those observed for other monoclonal antibody drugs. BIIB023 serum exposure increased in a dose-dependent manner in all groups, but not in direct proportion to dose level; at concentrations below ~10 mug ml(-1) , nonlinear clearance was observed. Soluble TWEAK levels decreased to below the level of quantitation after BIIB023 treatment, with concomitant changes in TWEAK: BIIB023 complex levels. CONCLUSIONS: No clinically meaningful differences were observed in BIIB023 pharmacokinetic and pharmacodynamic properties in healthy Chinese, Japanese and Caucasian volunteers; pharmacodynamic measures suggested target engagement. TWEAK may be an attractive therapeutic target for lupus nephritis treatment. Copyright © 2016 The British Pharmacological Society.",

METHODS: Patients initiating biologic therapy in Alberta (2004-2012) were characterized for disease severity and treatment response. Provincial hospitalization separations, physician claims, outpatient department data, and emergency department data were used to estimate treatment complication event rates and healthcare costs. RESULTS: Indigenous patients (n = 90) presented with higher disease activity [mean 28-joint count Disease Activity Score (DAS28) 6.11] than non-indigenous patients (n = 1400, mean DAS28 5.19, p < 0.0001). Improvements in DAS28, function, swollen joint count, CRP, and patient and physician global evaluation scores were comparable to non-indigenous patients, but indigenous patients did not have a significant improvement in erythrocyte sedimentation rate (-0.31 per month, 95% CI -0.79 to 0.16, p = 0.199). At the end of study followup, 13% (12\/90) of indigenous and 33% (455\/1400) of non-indigenous patients were in DAS28 remission (p < 0.001). Indigenous patients had a 40% increased risk of all-cause hospitalization [adjusted incidence rate ratio (IRR) 1.4, 95% CI 1.1-1.8, p = 0.01] and a 4-fold increase in serious infection rate (adjusted IRR 4.0, 95% CI 2.3-7.0, p < 0.001).

        "Abstract":"OBJECTIVES: Etanercept, an injectable tumor necrosis factor (TNF) receptor fusion protein, binds and inactivates human TNF and is used in active rheumatoid arthritis. Blocking TNF with monoclonal antibodies has also been beneficial in Crohn's disease. We attempted to determine the efficacy and safety of etanercept for induction of clinical, endoscopic, and histological improvement in patients with moderate to severe Crohn's disease despite standard treatment. METHODS: Ten patients with active Crohn's disease were treated with etanercept (25 mg s.c.) twice per week for 12 wk. Background therapy was kept stable during the trial. Crohn's disease activity index (CDAI), Inflammatory Bowel Disease Questionnaire, and C-reactive protein levels were measured at weeks 0, 2, 4, 8, and 12. Colonoscopies were performed before and after therapy in responders; endoscopic biopsies were scored for inflammation. RESULTS: At week 2 after the start, a clinical response (deltaCDAI > or = 70) was observed in 6\/10 patients (median = 305 [294-418] to 166 [107-392]), with reduction in serum C-reactive protein levels (median = 17.2 [6.8-67.2] to 9.1 [0.9-17.2] mg\/dl). Colonoscopies showed a reduction in inflammatory lesions in the four patients who attained remission (CDAI < 150), whereas the inflammatory score of the biopsies did not decrease significantly. No moderate or severe adverse events were observed. CONCLUSIONS: Etanercept may be effective in Crohn's disease refractory to standard therapy.",

        "Abstract":"OBJECTIVES: It is well recognized that medication adherence of rheumatoid arthritis (RA) patients is often poor. As less attention has been paid to physicians' adherence to targeted treatment, we aimed to investigate how it affects outcomes in aggressively treated early RA patients. METHOD: In the new Finnish RA Combination Therapy (NEO-RACo) trial, 99 patients with early active RA were treated, targeting remission, with a combination of methotrexate, sulfasalazine, hydroxychloroquine, and low-dose prednisolone for 2 years, and randomized to receive infliximab or placebo for the initial 6 months. After 2 years, therapy was unrestricted while remission was still targeted. Patients were divided into tertiles by physicians' adherence to treat-to-target, which was evaluated with a scoring system during the initial 2 years. After 5 years of follow-up, the between-tertile differences in remission rates, 28-joint Disease Activity Score (DAS28) levels, radiological changes, cumulative days off work, and the use of anti-rheumatic medication were assessed. RESULTS: Follow-up data were available for 93 patients. Physicians' good adherence was associated with improved remission rates at 2-4 years and lower DAS28 levels throughout the follow-up. In a multivariable model, physicians' adherence was the most important predictor of remission at 3 months and 2 years (p < 0.001 for both). Between 2 and 5 years, biologics were used more often in the tertile of low adherence compared with the other two groups (p = 0.024). No significant differences were observed in radiological progression and cumulative days off work. CONCLUSIONS: Physicians' good adherence is associated with improved remission rates and lesser use of biologics in early RA.",

METHODS: Patients were recruited if they had early arthritis of < 6 months' duration, had a high probability of developing RA, and had never been prescribed disease-modifying antirheumatic drugs (DMARD) or steroids. Logistic regression analysis was used to determine factors that predict outcome. RESULTS: We included 813 patients from December 2002 to April 2005. Age was 48.1 +\/- 12.6 years, delay before referral 103.1 +\/- 52.4 days, 28-joint Disease Activity Score (DAS28) 5.1 +\/- 1.3, Health Assessment Questionnaire (HAQ) 1.0 +\/- 0.7; 45.8% and 38.7% had rheumatoid factor or antibodies to cyclic citrullinated peptide (anti-CCP), respectively; 22% had hand or foot erosions; 78.5% fulfilled the American College of Rheumatology\/European League Against Rheumatism criteria for RA at baseline and 93.8% during followup. At 5 years, 573 patients were evaluated. The outcome was mild for most patients: disease activity (median DAS28 = 2.5) and HAQ disability (median 0.3) were well controlled over time; 50.6% achieved DAS28 remission and 64.7% low disease activity. Radiographic progression was low (2.9 Sharp unit\/year) and only a few patients required joint surgery. Nevertheless, some patients developed new comorbidities. During the 5 years, 82.7% of patients had received at least 1 DMARD (methotrexate, 65.9%), 18.3% a biological DMARD, and about 60% prednisone at least once. Anti-CCP was the best predictor of remaining in the cohort for 5 years, of prescription of synthetic or biologic DMARD, and of radiographic progression. CONCLUSION: The 5-year outcome of an early RA cohort in the 2000s was described. Anti-CCP was a robust predictor of outcome. The generally good 5-year outcome could be related to early referral and early effective treatment, key processes in the management of early RA in daily practice.",

        "Abstract":"OBJECTIVE: To identify factors predicting response to first TNF blocking treatment course in patients with established RA with a special focus on gender differences. METHODS: Patients with active RA initiating their first treatment course of TNF-blocking therapy were enrolled. The study period was March 1999 through September 2006. The prospective protocol included information on demographics, clinical characteristics of patients and response measures. Fulfilment of ACR 50-70% improvement and European League Against Rheumatism (EULAR) good response or remission [28-joint disease activity score (DAS28) <2.6] at 3 months were chosen as primary outcome measures. Potential predictors of responses were identified using multivariate binary logistic regression models. RESULTS: In total, 1565 patients were included in the study. Gender did not influence treatment response. Consistently, concomitant methotrexate (MTX) was significantly associated with EULAR remission, EULAR good response, ACR50 response and ACR70 response with odds ratios (ORs) 1.97, 2.13, 2.10 and 1.75, respectively. Concurrent treatment with other DMARDs was also significantly associated with EULAR remission, EULAR good response and ACR50 response (OR: 1.96, 2.24 and 1.94, respectively). Likewise, low HAQ at baseline consistently predicted good clinical outcome. Disease activity at baseline was directly associated with favourable response when measured by ACR50 and ACR70 (OR: 1.59 and 1.60, respectively), whereas DAS28 score at baseline was inversely associated with EULAR remission (OR: 0.78). CONCLUSIONS: In this observational study of patients with established RA, gender did not predict response to anti-TNF therapy, whereas treatment with concomitant DMARDs, especially MTX and low disability were associated with good response.

METHODS: Interleukin-1 receptor antagonist (IL-1ra), soluble tumor necrosis factor receptors p55 and p75 (sTNFr; p55 and p75), interleukin-1 beta (IL-1 beta), tumor necrosis factor alpha (TNF-alpha), interleukin-8 (IL-8), and monocyte chemoattractant protein 1 (MCP-1) were assessed by immunoassays in sera and MNC culture supernatants of 27 patients with RA with active disease before and 14 patients with inactive disease during MTX treatment, and 10 healthy controls. RESULTS: Levels of circulating IL-1ra, sTNFr p55 and p75 were higher in patients with active RA compared to those with inactive disease or controls. At the cellular level, resting MNC of patients with active RA released more IL-1 beta and IL-8, but less IL-1ra, and showed a lower ratio of IL-1ra:IL-1 beta than MNC of patients without inflammatory symptoms or healthy controls. In addition, unstimulated and in vitro lipopolysaccharide stimulated MNC cultures of patients with inactive RA released higher amounts of sTNFr p75 than MNC of patients with active RA. CONCLUSION: Circulating levels of IL-1ra and sTNFr as well as IL-1 beta, IL-8, and sTNFr p75 release from MNC and the ratio of IL-1ra:IL-1 beta production by these cells serve as markers to assess complete disease remission in patients with RA during MTX treatment.",

        "Abstract":"BACKGROUND: Present treatment strategies for rheumatoid arthritis include use of disease-modifying antirheumatic drugs, but a minority of patients achieve a good response. We aimed to test the hypothesis that an improved outcome can be achieved by employing a strategy of intensive outpatient management of patients with rheumatoid arthritis--for sustained, tight control of disease activity--compared with routine outpatient care. METHODS: We designed a single-blind, randomised controlled trial in two teaching hospitals. We screened 183 patients for inclusion. 111 were randomly allocated either intensive management or routine care. Primary outcome measures were mean fall in disease activity score and proportion of patients with a good response (defined as a disease activity score <2.4 and a fall in this score from baseline by >1.2). Analysis was by intention-to-treat. FINDINGS: One patient withdrew after randomisation and seven dropped out during the study. Mean fall in disease activity score was greater in the intensive group than in the routine group (-3.5 vs -1.9, difference 1.6 [95% CI 1.1-2.1], p<0.0001). Compared with routine care, patients treated intensively were more likely to have a good response (definition, 45\/55 [82%] vs 24\/55 [44%], odds ratio 5.8 [95% CI 2.4-13.9], p<0.0001) or be in remission (disease activity score <1.6; 36\/55 [65%] vs 9\/55 [16%], 9.7 [3.9-23.9], p<0.0001). Three patients assigned routine care and one allocated intensive management died during the study; none was judged attributable to treatment. INTERPRETATION: A strategy of intensive outpatient management of rheumatoid arthritis substantially improves disease activity, radiographic disease progression, physical function, and quality of life at no additional cost.",

        "Abstract":"OBJECTIVES: To study the outcome in clinical practice of first DMARD and\/or corticosteroid (CS) treatment in patients with recent onset rheumatoid arthritis (RA). PATIENTS: 245 patients with active RA, not previously treated with DMARDs or CS, were randomised to one of two treatment groups, T1 = 7.5-15 mg of prednisolone (PRE) daily for one to three months followed, if needed, by methotrexate (MTX) in a weekly dose of 5-15 mg in addition to the lowest possible dose of PRE or T2 = sulfasalazine (SAL), supplemented with lowest possible CS dose if needed. METHODS: The EULAR individual response criteria were applied and remission was defined as a final DAS28 < 2.6. Function was assessed by the HAQ and radiographic progression by Larsen scores. A patient who managed to remain on the allocated treatment for two years was described as a \"completer\". RESULTS: After 2 years of treatment, 70% of the patients in T1 and 63% in T2 were responders (30% and 33% \"good responders\", respectively). In T1 29% and in T2 19% were in remission. There was a significant functional improvement in both groups but radiographic progression occurred. The mean decrease in HAQ and increase in the Larsen score were similar in the two groups. One-third of the patients were non-completers, 19% from T1 and 47% from T2. Non-completers had, compared with completers, a significantly lower rate of individual response and remission. Completers and non-completers had similar functional improvement and similar radiological progression. CONCLUSIONS: Individual response and remission was reduced in patients who did not complete their first DMARD\/CS treatment option. Treatment failures were significantly more frequent in the sulfasalazine plus optional CS than in the CS plus optional methotrexate treatment group.",

        "Published":"2011 Nov 17",
        "Abstract":"BACKGROUND: This multicenter, open-label, prospective, single cohort study evaluated the effectiveness and safety of adalimumab in a clinical setting reflecting the Canadian standard of care for the treatment of patients with rheumatoid arthritis (RA). METHODS: Patients >= 18 years of age with a history of active RA >= 3 months and fulfilling Canadian requirements for biological therapy received adalimumab 40 mg subcutaneously every other week for 12 weeks. Pre-study DMARD treatment regimens, corticosteroids, or NSAIDs were allowed throughout the study. The primary effectiveness outcome measure was the mean change in 28-joint disease activity score (DAS28) from baseline to Week 12. Secondary measures included the proportion of patients achieving joint remission (DAS28 < 2.6) and low-disease activity (DAS28 < 3.2) at Week 12, and European League Against Rheumatism (EULAR: moderate and good) and American College of Rheumatology (ACR: ACR20, 50, and 70) responses, as well as responses in ACR core components at Weeks 4, 8, and 12. Subgroup analysis included a comparison of patients naive to biological DMARD (BDMARD) therapy versus BDMARD-experienced patients. Safety was assessed in terms of adverse and serious adverse events. RESULTS: A total of 879 patients (mean disease duration > 12 years) were enrolled; 772 (87.9%) completed the 12-week period. Adalimumab treatment was associated with rapid and sustained improvements in the signs and symptoms of RA. Significant improvements in mean DAS28 score were observed as early as Week 4. After 12 weeks of adalimumab treatment, 15.3% and 28.9% of patients achieved clinical remission and low-disease activity, respectively. Similarly, significant improvements in ACR core components were observed as early as Week 4, with continued improvements occurring through 12 weeks. Patients naive to BDMARD therapy demonstrated numerically greater clinical responses when compared with patients who had experienced prior BDMARD therapy, although both subgroups were associated with significant improvements from baseline. The rates and types of adverse events, as well as the results of laboratory measures, demonstrated that adalimumab was generally safe and well-tolerated. CONCLUSIONS: This study demonstrated that, under conditions reflective of the normal clinical practice in Canada, adalimumab is an effective and safe treatment for patients with RA.

        "Abstract":"OBJECTIVE: To compare the efficacy and toxicity of cyclosporin A (CsA) monotherapy with CsA plus methotrexate (MTX) combination therapy in patients with early rheumatoid arthritis (RA). PATIENTS AND METHODS: 120 patients with active RA, rheumatoid factor positive and\/or erosive, were randomly allocated to receive CsA with MTX (n=60) or CsA with placebo (n=60). Treatment with CsA was started in all patients at 2.5 mg\/kg\/day and increased to a maximum of 5 mg\/kg\/day in 16 weeks. MTX was started at 7.5 mg\/week and increased to a maximal dose of 15 mg\/week at week 16. Primary outcomes were clinical remission (Pinals criteria) and radiological damage (Larsen score), at week 48. RESULTS: Treatment was discontinued prematurely in 27 patients in the monotherapy group (21 because of inefficacy, and six because of toxicity) and in 26 patients in the combination therapy group (14 and 12, respectively). At week 48, clinical remission was achieved in four patients in the monotherapy group and in six patients in the combination therapy group (p=0.5). The median Larsen score increased to 10 (25th, 75th centiles: 3.5; 13.3) points in the monotherapy group and to 4 (1.0; 10.5) points in the combination therapy group (p=0.004). 28\/60 (47%) of patients in the monotherapy group v 34\/60 (57%) of patients in the combination therapy group had reached an American college of Rheumatology 20% (ACR20) response (p=0.36) at week 48; 15\/60 (25%) v 29\/60 (48%) of patients had reached an ACR50 response (p=0.013); and 7 (12%) v 12 (20%) of patients had reached an ACR70 response (p=0.11). Their was a tendency towards more toxicity in the combination therapy group. CONCLUSIONS: In patients with early RA, neither CsA plus MTX combination therapy nor CsA monotherapy is very effective in inducing clinical remission. Combination therapy is probably better at improving clinical disease activity, and definitely better at slowing radiological progression. Combination therapy should still be compared with methotrexate monotherapy.",

In recent years there have been important advances in the pathogenesis of RA, together with new diagnostic and therapeutic insights. Early diagnosis is essential in order to prevent joint damage and improve the prognosis and quality of life of patients with RA. New classification diagnostic criteria have been proposed to achieve this objective. New therapeutic strategies have proved to be effective, including early and better use of synthetic disease-modifying anti-rheumatic drugs (DMARDS), mainly methotrexate, and a treat-to-target strategy focusing on achieving remission and with tight control of the disease. In the last decade, the introduction of various biological agents in the therapeutic armamentarium of RA has changed the disease prognosis, although no definite cure is currently possible. In this chapter, we present an overview of recent advances in the epidemiology, diagnosis, prognosis and treatment of this severe but treatable disease.",

        "Abstract":"Although anti-TNF drugs have changed the clinical course of rheumatoid arthritis (RA), survival rates and resistance-to-therapy data confirm that about 30% of RA patients fail to respond. The aim of this study was to evaluate the correlations between the development of antidrug antibodies, specific IgG4 antibodies against TNF inhibitors, and resistance to therapy in RA patients. This retrospective study involved 129 patients with established RA naive to biological agents (98 females and 32 males, mean age 56.7+\/-12.3 years, disease duration 6.3+\/-1.2 years, baseline Disease Activity Score [DAS]-28 3.2-5.6) who received treatment with anti-TNF agents after the failure of conventional disease-modifying antirheumatic drugs (32 received infliximab [IFX], 58 etanercept [ETN], and 39 adalimumab [ADA]). After 6 months of treatment, the patients were classified as being in remission (DAS28 <2.6), having low disease activity (LDA; DAS28 2.6-3.2), or not responding (NR: DAS28 >3.2). The patients were also tested for serum antidrug antibodies and IgG4 antibodies against TNF inhibitors. After 24 weeks of treatment, 38% of the ETN-treated patients and 28% of those treated with ADA had injection-site reactions; the rate of systemic reactions in the IFX group was 25%. The differences among the three groups were not statistically significant (P=0.382; ETN versus ADA P=0.319). The percentages of patients with adverse events stratified by drug response were: LDA 8% and NR 18% in the ADA group; in remission 3%, LDA 22%, and NR 10% in the ETN group; and LDA 6% and NR 16% in the IFX group (P=0.051). The percentages of patients with antidrug antibodies were: ADA 33.3%, ETN 11.5%, and IFX 10.3% (P=0.025; ADA versus ETN P=0.015). The percentages of patients with IgG4 antibodies were: ADA 6%, ETN 13%, and IFX 26% (P=0.017; ADA versus ETN P=0.437). Associations between antidrug antibodies, specific IgG4 antibodies, and adverse reactions were not significant for any of the three drugs. IgG4 levels were higher in the ADA group than in the other two groups, and higher in the patients with worse DAS28 (NR) and in those experiencing adverse events. These data suggest a possible association between IgG4 levels and worse DAS28 (r (2)=5.8%, P=0.011). The presence of specific IgG4 antibodies against TNF blockers in patients with RA might affect the drugs' activity. Patients with injection-site reactions and IgG4 against ETN may show a decreased response.",

        "Abstract":"OBJECTIVE: To determine if variations in trial eligibility criteria and patient baseline characteristics could be considered effect modifiers of the treatment response when testing targeted therapies (biological agents and targeted synthetic disease modifying antirheumatic drugs (DMARDs)) for rheumatoid arthritis (RA). METHODS: We conducted a meta-epidemiological study of all trials evaluating a targeted therapy approved by regulatory authorities for treating RA. The database search was completed on December 11th 2013. Eligible trials reported ACR20 data at months 3-6 and used an add-on design. Odds ratios (ORs) were calculated from the response rates and compared among the trial eligibility criteria\/patient baseline characteristics of interest. Comparisons are presented as the Ratio of Odds Ratios (ROR). RESULTS: Sixty-two trials (19,923 RA patients) were included in the primary analyses using ACR20 response. Overall, targeted therapies constituted an effective treatment (OR 3.96 95% confidence interval (CI) 3.41 to 4.60). The majority of the trial eligibility criteria and patient baseline characteristics did not modify treatment effect. The added benefit of targeted therapies was lower in trials including \"DMARD-naive\" patients compared with trials including \"DMARD inadequate responders\" (ROR = 0.45, 95%CI 0.31 to 0.66) and trials including \"targeted therapy inadequate responders\" (0.50, 95%CI 0.29 to 0.87), test for interaction: p = 0.0002. Longer mean disease duration was associated with a higher likelihood of responding to treatment (beta = 1.05, 95%CI 1.00 to 1.11 OR's per year; p = 0.03). Analyses conducted using DAS28-remission as the outcome supported the above-mentioned findings. CONCLUSION: Our results suggest that a highly selective inclusion is not associated with greater treatment effect, as might otherwise be expected. The added benefit of a targeted therapy was lower in trials including patients who were DMARD-naive and trials including patients with shorter disease durations.",

        "Abstract":"Polyarticular juvenile idiopathic arthritis (JIA) is a category of JIA where multiple joints are affected by chronic inflammation, and where serious and lasting damage to joints is the expected natural history in untreated disease. There is evidence of response to disease-modifying antirheumatic and biologic drugs, but little evidence of permanent remission from any of the existing therapeutic trials. The TREAT trial by Wallace et al., recently published in Arthritis and Rheumatism, used a collaborative multicenter approach to studying early aggressive treatment of polyarticular JIA in an attempt to achieve full clinical inactive disease after 6 months of treatment. The study's main finding that the earlier in the disease course that treatment is started, the better the chance of disease control, has provided evidence that there is a 'window of opportunity' for treating JIA as there is in adult rheumatoid arthritis (RA). The study provides both a platform and an impetus for concentrating future treatment trials on early rather than established disease and investigating a standard of starting treatment within 10 to 12 weeks.",

        "Abstract":"BACKGROUND: Previous studies have revealed that hepatitis B virus (HBV) infection may be associated with rheumatoid arthritis (RA), while there are no further clinical studies regarding the role of HBV infection in RA progression during disease-modifying anti-rheumatic drug (DMARD) therapy. Here, we aimed to explore the influence of HBV infection on radiographic and clinical outcomes among patients with RA in a clinical practice setting. METHODS: Thirty-two consecutive patients with RA (Disease Activity Score 28-joint assessment based on C-reactive protein (DAS28-CRP) >=2.6) with chronic HBV infection (CHB) were retrospectively recruited as the CHB group and 128 age-matched, sex-matched, and disease activity-matched contemporary patients with RA without CHB were included in the non-CHB group. Clinical data were collected at baseline and visits at month 1, 3, 6, and 12. The therapeutic target was defined as DAS28-CRP <2.6 in all patients or <3.2 in patients with long disease duration (>24 months). The primary outcome was the percentage of patients with one-year radiographic progression (a change in modified total Sharp score >=0.5). RESULTS: Compared with the non-CHB group, a significantly higher percentage of patients with one-year radiographic progression was observed in the CHB group (53% vs. 17%, p < 0.001), with smaller proportions of patients achieving therapeutic target at month 6 and month 12 (53% vs. 82% and 53% vs. 75%, both p < 0.05), remission at month 6 (DAS28-CRP <2.6, 50% vs. 72%, p = 0.039), and American College of Rheumatology (ACR)20\/50 responses and good or moderate European League Against Rheumatism (EULAR) responses mainly at month 6 and 12 (all p < 0.05). Multivariate logistic regression analysis revealed that CHB status was significantly associated with one-year radiographic progression and failure to achieve therapeutic target within 6 months. HBV reactivation occurred in 34% of patients with CHB during one-year follow up, with two patients suffering hepatitis flare. CONCLUSIONS: HBV infection may play a deleterious role in radiographic and clinical outcomes in patients with RA, and HBV reactivation should be paid close attention during immunosuppressive therapy.",

        "Published":"2002",
        "Abstract":"Juvenile rheumatoid arthritis (JRA) is the most common childhood chronic systemic autoimmune inflammatory disease. The therapeutic approach to JRA has, to date, been casual and based on extensions of clinical experiences gained in the management of adult rheumatoid arthritis (RA). The physiology of inflammation has been systemically studied and this has led to the identification of specific therapeutic targets and the development of novel approaches to the management of JRA. The classical treatments of the disease such as methotrexate, sodium aurothiomalate and sulfasalazine, are not always effective in controlling RA and JRA. This has necessitated the development of novel agents for treating RA, most of which are biological in nature and are targeted at specific sites of the inflammatory cascades. These biological therapeutic strategies in RA have proved successful and are being applied in the management of JRA. These developments have been facilitated by the advances in molecular biology which have heralded the advent of biodrugs (recombinant proteins) and gene therapy, in which specific genes can be introduced locally to enhance in vivo gene expression or suppress gene(s) of interest with a view to down-regulating inflammation. Some of these biodrugs, such as anti-tumor necrosis factor alpha (anti-TNFalpha), monoclonal antibodies (infliximab, adalimumab), TNF soluble receptor constructs (etanercept) and interleukin-1 receptor antagonist (IL-1Ra) have been tested and shown to be effective in RA. Etanercept has now been licensed for JRA. Clinical trials of infliximab in JRA are planned. Studies show that the clinical effects are transient, necessitating repeated treatments and the risk of vaccination effects. Anti-inflammatory cytokines such as IL-4, IL-10, transforming growth factor-beta and interferon-beta (IFN-beta) are undergoing clinical trials. Many of these agents have to be administered parenterally and production costs are very high; thus, there is a need, especially for pediatric use, to develop agents that can be taken orally. Long-term studies will be required to assess the tolerability and toxicity of these approaches in JRA, since cytokines and other mediators play important roles in host defenses, and the chronic inhibition, exogenous administration or constitutive over-expression of some cytokines\/mediators may have undesirable effects.

        "Abstract":"INTRODUCTION: To investigate the course of functional status assessed by health assessment questionnaire (HAQ) in rheumatoid arthritis (RA) patients with sustained clinical remission (REM). METHODS: In recent RA clinical trials, we identified patients with subsequent visits of >=24 weeks in clinical REM according to the disease activity score using 28-joint counts including C-reactive protein (DAS28) (<=2.6), or simplified disease activity index (SDAI) (<=3.3). Area under the curve (AUC) and mean HAQ scores throughout the time in sustained REM were compared using t test, analyses of variance (ANOVA) and adjusted general linear modeling (GLM) with repeated measures. In Cox regression analyses, the time to regain full physical function was modeled. Sensitivity analyses were performed in patients of sustained SDAI low disease activity (LDA; SDAI <=11). RESULTS: A total of 610 out of 4364 patients achieved sustained DAS28 REM (14%) and 252 SDAI REM (5.8%). ANOVA testing for linear trend showed significant decrease of mean HAQ from week 0 (start of REM) to week 24, regardless of REM criteria used. AUC of HAQ throughout 24 weeks of REM was higher in DAS28 compared to SDAI REM (p <=0.01). GLM adjusting for covariates showed significant decrease of monthly HAQ scores from week 0 to 24 (DAS28: 0.276, 0.243, 0.229, 0.222, 0.219, 0.209 to 0.199; p = 0.0001; SDAI: 0.147, 0.142, 0.149, 0.129, 0.123, 0.117 to 0.114; p = 0.029). Similarly, a decrease of HAQ over time was found in patients of sustained SDAI LDA. In DAS28 REM, the chance of regaining full physical function was higher for female (hazard ratio HR [95% confidence interval]: 1.41 [1.13-1.76]) and early RA patients (disease duration <=2 years: HR 1.29 [1.01-1.65]); in SDAI REM no significant differences were found. CONCLUSIONS: Physical function continues to improve if the target of REM or LDA is sustained. The stringency of the remission criteria determines achievement of the best possible functional improvement.",

Guidance is, therefore, needed to identify those patients who might benefit most from this intensive treatment approach--and to identify those individuals who can be spared the potential adverse effects of such treatment without risking disease progression. As reviewed here, a variety of serological, clinical, immunological, radiological, and genetic markers have been proposed to predict clinical outcome in RA. These markers can all be determined without difficulty; however, with the notable exception of the genetic markers and erosions, these parameters are for the most part indicative of inflammatory disease activity and, therefore, subject to variation. As tight control of disease activity dissociates the prognostic markers from the clinical course, these predictive parameters should be assessed at baseline for every patient and used to guide individualized treatment strategies.

The study group consisted of 32 patients with RA followed up clinically and by ultrasound using the resistive index (RI) measurements in the patients' wrists as indicator of inflammation. Lower RI values were recorded at baseline compared with data derived at 1-y follow-up examination from patients in remission and normal controls (p < 0.001). Discrimination by spectral Doppler between patients in remission and those who had a relapse within six months after the examination was possible with an accuracy of 95.6%. Patients in remission who had a flare-up within six months after the examination had significantly lower (p < 0.01) RI values vs. patients who remained in stable remission. In conclusion, RI measurements may serve as an objective marker of disease activity and potentially as a predictor of the disease course in RA.",

        "Published":"2017 08",
        "Abstract":"BACKGROUND: The increase in Rheumatoid arthritis (RA) associated mortality is predominantly due to accelerated coronary artery and cerebrovascular atherosclerosis with increased risk of ischemic heart disease about 50% in RA patients compared to controls. OBJECTIVE: To study the pathogenesis of ischemic heart disease in RA, role of inflammatory cytokine interplay, disease activity and rheumatoid factor positivity. METHODS: Eighty RA patients and 44 healthy controls were included. All subjects were younger than 45years for females and 55years for males with exclusion of all traditional risk factors for atherosclerosis. Interleukin (IL) 1, 6 and 18 were assessed in all subjects. RA patients fulfilled ACR\/EULAR 2010 criteria and were subjected to Dobutaminestress-echocardiography, diseases activity assessed by DAS-28, X-ray hands for Larsen score and function assessment by HAQ. RESULTS: RA patients had significantly higher serum IL 1, 6 and 18 than controls (p=0.00 in all). Thirty four (42.5%) patients had hypertensive reaction on Dobutamine-stress-echocardiography, four of them had ischemic change, and 46 (57.5%) had normal reaction. All patients with hypertensive reaction had positive RF (p=0.00), 10 had DAS-28>5.1, 20 had DAS-28 from 3.2 to5.1 and 4 were in remission (p=0.001). CRP was higher in patients with hypertensive reaction (p=0.003) while serum levels of IL1, 6 and 18 showed no significant difference. In all patients, serum levels of IL1, 6 and 18 showed significant positive correlation with VAS, HAQ and DAS-28 (p<0.001 in all). Only IL18 showed significant positive correlation with X-ray score in all patients. CONCLUSION: Disease activity and RF positivity play an important risk factor for ischemic heart disease in RA. Serum levels of IL1, 6 and 18 did not help much in detecting patients at risk of ischemic heart disease. Better control of RA disease activity with early remission helps in preventing cardiac complications. More studies on larger number of patients are needed for better understanding of mechanism of ischemic heart disease in RA. Copyright © 2017 Elsevier Ltd. All rights reserved.",

        "Published":"2010 Mar",
        "Abstract":"BACKGROUND: Glucocorticoids (GCs) are often used as early arthritis treatment and it has been suggested that they induce remission or at least delay the development of rheumatoid arthritis (RA) and the need to start disease-modifying antirheumatic drugs (DMARDs). OBJECTIVE: To test the effect of GCs on patients with very early arthritis (symptom duration of <16 weeks) in a randomised controlled trial. METHODS: Patients received a single intramuscular injection of 120 mg methylprednisolone or placebo (PL) and were followed up for 52 weeks. Primary end point was drug-free clinical remission, both at weeks 12 and 52. Among secondary outcomes were fulfillment of remission criteria at weeks 2, 12 or 52, time course of 'core set variables' and proportion of patients starting DMARDs. RESULTS: 17.0% of all analysed subjects (65\/383) achieved persistent remission: 17.8% (33\/185) of the PL group, 16.2% (32\/198) of the patients receiving methylprednisolone (OR=1.13, 95% CI 0.66 to 1.92, p=0.6847). Analyses of secondary end points showed significant clinical benefits of the GC only at week 2. These differences subsequently disappeared. DMARDs were started in 162 patients: 50.3% methylprednisolone and 56.7% PL patients had to start DMARD treatment (OR=0.78, 95% CI 0.49 to 1.22, p=0.30). Significantly more patients with polyarthritis than with oligoarthritis received DMARDs (OR=2.84, 95% CI 1.75 to 4.60, p<0.0001). CONCLUSIONS: Neither remission nor development of RA is delayed by GC treatment. Remission is rare in the first year of very early arthritis, occurring in <20% of the patients. Also, the need to start DMARDs was not influenced by GC treatment.",

        "Published":"2011 Apr",
        "Abstract":"Asthma treatment goals focus on disease control rather than remission as a therapeutic aim. This is in contrast to diseases where remission is frequently discussed and has well-defined criteria. In this review, we consider the similarities and differences between remission in asthma and another chronic inflammatory disease, rheumatoid arthritis, where new therapies have made remission a realistic treatment goal. Clinical remission of asthma is often defined as prolonged absence of asthma symptoms without requirement for medication while others insist on the demonstration of normal lung function and airway responsiveness. Even in those who develop a symptomatic remission of asthma, persistent physiological abnormalities and airway inflammation are common. There is a clear need to develop a precise, internationally accepted, definition of asthma remission that can be used as a therapeutic endpoint in studies of new asthma treatments. Spontaneous remission of asthma symptoms is relatively common, especially during adolescence. It is more likely in males, those with mild symptoms and normal lung function and in those who quit smoking, and may be linked to normalisation of immune function. Remission is less likely in severe asthma, atopy, eosinophilia, airflow obstruction, continued smoking and weight gain. Studies of spontaneous remissions may provide insight into how remission might be induced with therapy. Remission is not identical to cure, there remains a risk of subsequent symptomatic relapse of asthma and there is little evidence that current asthma treatments can induce remission. Long-term remission should be regarded as the next therapeutic frontier in asthma management. Crown Copyright © 2011. Published by Elsevier Inc. All rights reserved.",

        "Abstract":"Several molecules have been identified as critical mediators of chronic inflammation in immune system-mediated disorders such as rheumatoid arthritis (RA), and biological therapies targeting these molecules have been developed during the past two decades. Compared with conventional therapies, anti-TNF biotherapies have greatly improved the treatment of patients with RA, and several biological agents with distinct mechanisms of action are under development. Despite significant advances in this field, unmet medical needs remain. RA is the prototype disease for the evaluation of targeted therapies, and various novel genes have been described as being critically involved in disease pathogenesis. Thus, a novel area of research has recently emerged in the field of RA therapy, involving the genetic screening and validation of novel candidates in vivo using RNAi. Among the vehicles for the efficient targeting of macrophages, which play a critical role in disease chronicity, cationic liposomes represent the most promising option for the safe and specific use of RNAi in vivo. This review discusses the role of cationic liposomes as a mechanism for the systemic administration of siRNAs in the validation of RA therapeutic targets. [References: 42]",

        "Published":"2018 May 21",
        "Abstract":"BACKGROUND Acquired hemophilia A (AH) is a rare hemorrhagic diathesis, characterized by the presence of autoantibodies directed against the pro-coagulant activity of factor VIII. It is associated with rheumatoid arthritis (RA) in 4% to 8% of cases and its prognosis remains severe. CASE REPORT A 66-year-old patient has been followed up for 20 years for deforming and severe RA, which was in low-disease activity. However, the patient presented a polyarticular flare involving the metacarpophalangeal and the proximal interphalangeal joints, the left elbow, and the right knee, which was warm and swollen. Articular puncture of this knee yielded a hematic fluid that did not coagulate. Its cytological analysis showed significant presence of red blood cells, which were also abundantly present in the other cell lines. Activated partial thromboplastin time was lengthened and not corrected by the addition of control plasma. Prothrombin time (Quick's test), fibrinogen level, and vitamin K-dependent factors were without abnormalities. In contrast, factor VIII was collapsed at 7% and the anti-factor VIII antibody was positive. The diagnosis of AH with anti-factor VIII inhibitor was thus retained. With regard to RA, the Disease Activity Score was 6.32 and exhibited a very active RA. Rituximab with methotrexate was begun and the evolution was favorable. After 6 months, the reappearance of the anti-factor VIII inhibitor was found, thus justifying a second cycle of rituximab. CONCLUSIONS AH is not exceptional in RA. Rituximab remains a relevant alternative for managing simultaneous AH with inhibitor and RA.",

        "Abstract":"BACKGROUND: In the present study, we explored the effects of immediate induction therapy with the anti-tumour necrosis factor (TNF)alpha antibody infliximab (IFX) plus methotrexate (MTX) compared with MTX alone and with placebo (PL) in patients with very early inflammatory arthritis. METHODS: In an investigator-initiated, double-blind, randomised, placebo-controlled, multi-centre trial (ISRCTN21272423, http:\/\/www.isrctn.com\/ISRCTN21272423 ), patients with synovitis of 12 weeks duration in at least two joints underwent 1 year of treatment with IFX in combination with MTX, MTX monotherapy, or PL randomised in a 2:2:1 ratio. The primary endpoint was clinical remission after 1 year (sustained for at least two consecutive visits 8 weeks apart) with remission defined as no swollen joints, 0-2 tender joints, and an acute-phase reactant within the normal range. RESULTS: Ninety patients participated in the present study. At week 54 (primary endpoint), 32% of the patients in the IFX + MTX group achieved sustained remission compared with 14% on MTX alone and 0% on PL. This difference (p < 0.05 over all three groups) was statistically significant for IFX + MTX vs PL (p < 0.05), but not for IFX + MTX vs MTX (p = 0.10), nor for MTX vs PL (p = 0.31). Remission was maintained during the second year on no therapy in 75% of the IFX + MTX patients compared with 20% of the MTX-only patients. CONCLUSIONS: These results indicate that patients with early arthritis can benefit from induction therapy with anti-TNF plus MTX compared with MTX alone, suggesting that intensive treatment can alter the disease evolution. TRIAL REGISTRATION: The trial was registered at http:\/\/www.isrctn.com\/ISRCTN21272423 on 4 October 2007 (date applied)\/12 December 2007 (date assigned).

        "Abstract":"OBJECTIVES: The phase III RADIATE study examined the efficacy and safety of tocilizumab, an anti-IL-6 receptor monoclonal antibody in patients with rheumatoid arthritis (RA) refractory to tumour necrosis factor (TNF) antagonist therapy. METHODS: 499 patients with inadequate response to one or more TNF antagonists were randomly assigned to receive 8 mg\/kg or 4 mg\/kg tocilizumab or placebo (control) intravenously every 4 weeks with stable methotrexate for 24 weeks. ACR20 responses, secondary efficacy and safety endpoints were assessed. RESULTS: ACR20 was achieved at 24 weeks by 50.0%, 30.4% and 10.1% of patients in the 8 mg\/kg, 4 mg\/kg and control groups, respectively (less than p<0.001 both tocilizumab groups versus control). At week 4 more patients achieved ACR20 in 8 mg\/kg tocilizumab versus controls (less than p = 0.001). Patients responded regardless of most recently failed anti-TNF or the number of failed treatments. DAS28 remission (DAS28 <2.6) rates at week 24 were clearly dose related, being achieved by 30.1%, 7.6% and 1.6% of 8 mg\/kg, 4 mg\/kg and control groups (less than p = 0.001 for 8 mg\/kg and p = 0.053 for 4 mg\/kg versus control). Most adverse events were mild or moderate with overall incidences of 84.0%, 87.1% and 80.6%, respectively. The most common adverse events with higher incidence in tocilizumab groups were infections, gastrointestinal symptoms, rash and headache. The incidence of serious adverse events was higher in controls (11.3%) than in the 8 mg\/kg (6.3%) and 4 mg\/kg (7.4%) groups. CONCLUSION: Tocilizumab plus methotrexate is effective in achieving rapid and sustained improvements in signs and symptoms of RA in patients with inadequate response to TNF antagonists and has a manageable safety profile.

Tumour necrosis factor-alpha (TNF-alpha) inhibitors were the first biologic drug class licensed for the treatment of rheumatoid arthritis. Etanercept is a fusion protein composed of two TNF receptors bound to the constant portion (Fc) of human immunoglobulin G (IgG). AREAS COVERED: This article will consider the pharmacological properties of etanercept and the clinical efficacy data presented in clinical trials. Its safety in clinical practice will be reviewed. EXPERT OPINION: There is overwhelming evidence to support the use of etanercept in rheumatoid arthritis. Trial data demonstrate etanercept's efficacy in reducing structural damage, improving clinical outcomes and inducing remission. Optimal response to therapy is seen when used in combination with methotrexate and when initiated early. Etanercept is an attractive therapeutic option given the excellent safety profile, reduced immunogenicity and ease of administration.",

        "Abstract":"As tocilizumab (TCZ) greatly inhibits inflammatory markers, methods of evaluating rheumatoid arthritis (RA) disease activity that include inflammatory markers may overestimate the effect of TCZ treatment. We have evaluated the impact of inflammatory markers on the efficacy of TCZ by comparing the efficacy indicated by the 28-joint disease activity score using erythrocyte sedimentation rate (DAS28-ESR) with that indicated by the clinical and simplified disease activity indexes (CDAI and SDAI, respectively) and the American College of Rheumatology (ACR) core set criteria in a double-blind study of TCZ-the SATORI study. The Spearman correlation coefficient between DAS28-ESR and CDAI was comparable between that at week 24 and that at baseline [correlation coefficient at baseline and week 24 was 0.823 (p < 0.0001) and 0.818 (p < 0.0001), respectively]. A large difference between the DAS28 remission rate and CDAI remission rate was observed at week 24. However, these results are comparable to those of a previous study conducted with non-TCZ-treated patients. Moreover, the same results were obtained in the comparison between the DAS28-ESR and SDAI, even though the SDAI includes an inflammatory parameter as a component. These results confirm that the DAS28-ESR has a validity comparable to that of other methods in terms of evaluating the RA treatment efficacy of TCZ, despite its strong inflammatory marker-inhibiting effects.",

METHODS: Early, biologic and MTX-naive RA patients (N=395) were evenly randomised to open-label adalimumab (40 mg every other week) plus weekly blinded 2.5, 5, 10 or 20 mg MTX for 26 weeks. Clinical, radiographic and functional outcomes were analysed using two-sided linear trend tests or one-way analysis of covariance. RESULTS: Statistically significant increasing trends were observed in the proportion of patients achieving the primary endpoint, 28-joint count disease activity score with C reactive protein (DAS28(CRP)) <3.2 (42.9%, 44.0%, 56.6% and 60.2% for 2.5, 5, 10 or 20 mg\/week MTX, respectively), DAS28(CRP) <2.6 and American College of Rheumatology 50\/70\/90 responses with increasing doses of MTX in combination with adalimumab. No statistical differences in minimal clinically important differences in physical function were detected. Statistically significant trends for achieving low disease activity and remission were demonstrated with increasing MTX dose by validated clinical indices; differences comparing 10 and 20 mg MTX were minimal. Adalimumab serum concentrations increased with ascending dose up to 10 mg MTX. More patients experienced infectious adverse events with increasing MTX dose. CONCLUSIONS: Increasing doses of MTX in combination with adalimumab demonstrated a statistically significant trend in improved clinical outcomes that mimicked the adalimumab pharmacokinetic profile. In early RA patients initiating adalimumab combination therapy, efficacy of 10 and 20 mg\/week MTX appeared equivalent. Copyright Published by the BMJ Publishing Group Limited.

The aim of this retrospective analysis was to evaluate the effectiveness and safety of golimumab following usual clinical practice in Japanese patients with rheumatoid arthritis (RA) according to the recommendations given in the Japanese package insert. PATIENTS AND METHODS: Japanese RA patients with moderate-to-high disease activity, according to the 28-joint disease activity score based on C-reactive protein (DAS28-CRP) criteria, despite treatment with MTX or another biological agent, were enrolled. Patients were assigned to 50 mg golimumab plus MTX or 100 mg golimumab monotherapy every 4 weeks for 24 weeks. All patients were given MTX if it was not contraindicated. The primary endpoint was the proportion of patients achieving clinical remission (defined as a DAS28-CRP <2.3 or a simplified disease activity index [SDAI] score <3.3) at 24 weeks. RESULTS: Most patients received combined 50 mg golimumab plus MTX (41\/43). In these patients, the primary endpoint, clinical remission, was attained in 83 % of patients according to DAS28-CRP criteria (p < 0.001) and 69 % according to SDAI criteria (p < 0.001) by week 24.

Treatment adjustments involving dose increases, drug changes or expansion to combination therapy occurred based on three-monthly calculations of the Disease Activity Score (DAS), with a target of <=2.4. If this was achieved for 2 consecutive evaluations, treatment was tapered (combinations to monotherapy, monotherapy to maintenance dose). Prednisone and infliximab (either as part of initial treatment or as delayed treatment after failure on earlier therapies in arms 1, 2 and -for infliximab- 3) were always tapered and discontinued before other drugs. The outcomes of discontinuation of infliximab are presented. RESULTS: 77\/120 (64%) of patients who started initial infliximab were able to discontinue infliximab, whereas 27\/109 (25%) of patients who started delayed infliximab in arms 1-3 could discontinue infliximab. Discontinuation was independent of previous dose increases in order to achieve low DAS. After discontinuation of infliximab, 16 of 27 patients (59%) in arms 1-3 and 34 of 77 patients (44%) in arm 4 suffered a DAS flare >2.4 and had to restart treatment. Median time without infliximab treatment was 17 (IQR 3-47) months, and 29 of the 61 patients (58%) who needed to restart had been at least 1 year without infliximab. Restarting infliximab resulted in DAS <=2.4 in all patients, and there was no progression of radiological damage. Presence of shared epitope, smoking, and a long treatment with infliximab were independent predictors of infliximab restart. CONCLUSIONS: Data on infliximab discontinuation in the BeSt study suggest that this possible in 1 in 4 patients, or more if infliximab was the initial treatment, who have had at least 6 consecutive months of low disease activity. While MTX is continued, about 50% of patients can permanently stop infliximab without radiological damage progression, the others regain low disease activity after restarting infliximab. Treat to target strategies using biologic agents should include strategies for discontinuation.",

        "Published":"2009",
        "Abstract":"INTRODUCTION: The aim of this study was to determine a low disease activity threshold--a 28-joint disease activity score (DAS28) value--for the decision to maintain unchanged disease-modifying antirheumatic drug (DMARD) treatment in rheumatoid arthritis patients, based on expert opinion. METHODS: Nine hundred and sixty-seven case scenarios with various levels for each component of the DAS28 (resulting in a disease activity score between 2 and 3.2) were presented to 44 panelists. For each scenario, panelists had to decide whether or not DMARD treatment (excluding steroids) could be maintained unchanged. In each scenario, for decision, the participants were given the DAS28 parameters, without knowledge of the resultant DAS28. The relationship between panelists' decision, DAS28 value, and components of the score were analysed by multiple logistic regression analysis. Each panelist analysed 160 randomised scenarios. Intra-rater and inter-rater reproducibility were assessed. RESULTS: Forty-four panelists participated in the study. Inter-panelist agreement was good (kappa = 0.63; 95% confidence interval = 0.61 to 0.65). Intra-panelist agreement was excellent (kappa = 0.87; 95% confidence interval = 0.82 to 0.92). Quasi-perfect agreement was observed for DAS28 < or = 2.4, less pronounced between 2.5 and 2.9, and almost no agreement for DAS28 > 3.0. For values below 2.5, panelists agreed to maintain unchanged DMARDs; for values above 2.5, discrepancies occurred more frequently as the DAS28 value increased. Multivariate analysis confirmed the relationship between panelist's decision, DAS28 value and components of the DAS28. Between DAS28 of 2.4 and 3.2, a major determinant for panelists' decision was swollen joint count. Female and public practice physicians decided more often to maintain treatment unchanged. CONCLUSIONS: As a conclusion, panelists suggested that in clinical practice there is no need to change DMARD treatment in rheumatoid arthritis patients with DAS28 < or = 2.4.",

        "Abstract":"OBJECTIVE: Tumor necrosis factor-alpha inhibitors have been available in recent years for treating early and established rheumatoid arthritis (RA). Twice-weekly administration of 25 mg etanercept (ETN) has demonstrated efficacy and safety. The objective of this study was to evaluate the efficacy of once-weekly administration of 50 mg ETN (ETN50), and to compare it with that of twice-weekly administration of 25 mg ETN (ETN25). METHODS: The ETN50 group comprised 29 patients and the ETN25 group 26. The analysis compared changes from baseline in Disease Activity Score in 28 joints (DAS28)-C reactive protein (CRP) and DAS28-erythrocyte sedimentation rate (ESR) between the ETN50 and ETN25 groups. RESULTS: Overall, 42.3 % of ETN50 patients achieved DAS28-ESR remission (<2.6), and 76.9 % experienced low disease activity at 24 weeks. Patients in the ETN50 group also experienced more significant improvement in DAS28-ESR at 4 weeks, higher DAS28-ESR remission rates, and lower disease activity rates than ETN25 group patients. No serious adverse events were experienced in the safety analysis set (ETN50 group). CONCLUSION: These results suggest that ETN50 can lead to earlier remission and higher remission rates compared with ETN25 in patients with RA.",

        "Abstract":"OBJECTIVES: To evaluate the impact of clinical response on work stoppage or work absence among employed people with early RA. METHODS: First-year data from the combination of MTX and etanercept trial was used. The analyses were restricted to the 205 patients working full or part time at baseline who answered questions on whether they stopped working or missed days from work in one or more of the four follow-up visits. Work stoppage referred to the first occurrence of subjects reporting stopping work. Work absence was defined as whether patients reported missed days from work. Clinical response and activity state considered included the ACR and European League against Rheumatism response criteria, 28-joint DAS (DAS-28) remission and the minimum clinically important difference of the HAQ score. RESULTS: After adjustment for baseline characteristics, ACR70 responders were 72% less likely to stop working and 55% less likely to miss work than ACR20 non-responders (P < 0.05). Patients achieving DAS-28 remission were 54% less likely to stop work than those with DAS-28 > 3.2 (P < 0.05). Moderate improvements did not appear to effect work stoppage or missed days after adjustments.

        "Abstract":"Methotrexate is the dominant initial drug in the management of rheumatoid arthritis (RA). Despite its widespread use, methotrexate is associated with a number of adverse effects. Tapering its dose to the minimal amount required to maintain RA remission is, therefore, an important clinical goal. While the complete withdrawal of disease-modifying anti-rheumatic drugs is associated with a definite risk of a disease flare, it is unclear as to what the risk is specific to methotrexate withdrawal and whether this can be minimized by gradual dose reduction (termed 'tapering'). This review examines studies of methotrexate tapering and withdrawal on RA outcomes. It covers three scenarios: tapering\/withdrawing methotrexate monotherapy; tapering\/withdrawing methotrexate as part of a 'step-down' combination disease-modifying anti-rheumatic drug regimen; and tapering\/withdrawing methotrexate when it is being co-prescribed with biologic agents.",

We aimed to assess the efficacy and safety of bDMARDs among Malaysian RA patients treated in routine clinical practice. A retrospective medical chart review of RA patients from 11 government hospitals were conducted from January 2003 to January 2014. A standardized questionnaire was used to abstract patient's demographic, clinical and treatment data. Level of disease activity was measured by DAS28 collected at baseline, 3, 6 and 12 months. Three hundred and one patients were available for analysis, mean age 41 (SD, 10.8) years, mean RA duration 12.3 (SD, 6.9) years and 98% had history of two or more conventional-synthetic DMARDs. There were 467 bDMARD courses prescribed with mean bDMARDs duration use of 12.9 months (SD 14.7). Tumour necrosis factor alpha inhibitors were the most common prescribed bDMARDs (77.1%), followed by Tocilizumab (14.6%) and Rituximab (8.4%). We observed significant improvement in mean DAS28 values from baseline to 3, 6 and 12 months (p < 0.001). Overall, 16.9% achieved DAS28 remission at 6 months. A third (35.6%) of patients reported adverse events, three commonest being infections (46.5%), allergy (22.9%) and laboratory abnormalities (12.9%). 3.7% of our patients had tuberculosis.

The objectives of this study were to identify SR from an inception cohort of RA patients and to examine the impact of SR in an ample spectrum of PROs. METHODS: The study was developed in a well characterized and ongoing cohort of RA patients with recent onset disease recruited from 2004 onwards. In November 2016, the cohort included 187 patients, of whom 145 had at least 30 months of follow-up, with complete rheumatic assessments at regular intervals in addition to a pain visual analogue scale (PVAS), overall disease-VAS (OVAS), health assessment questionnaire (HAQ), Short-Form 36v2 Survey (SF-36) and fatigue assessment. First SR was defined according to the DAS28 cut-offs (DAS28-SR) and ACR\/EULAR 2011 Boolean definition (B-SR), if maintained for at least 12 consecutive months. The dependent t test and Mc Nemar's tests were used for comparisons between related groups. Local IRB approval was obtained. RESULTS: More patients achieved DAS28-SR than B-SR: 78 vs. 63, respectively. Fifty patients met both SR definitions. Follow-up to DAS28-SR was shorter than to B-SR and the duration of DAS28-SR was longer, p <= 0.023 for all comparisons. At SR, patients had PRO proxy to normal values; the percentage of patients with normal PRO varied from 97% (95% CI: 91-99) for HAQ to 50% (95% CI: 39-61) for absence of fatigue. In DAS28-SR patients, acute reactant phases within the normal range were detected very early (after 1.5-2.9 months). HAQ, PVAS, OVAS and SF-36 were scored within the normal range after 6-7 months. The absence of fatigue was detected at 8.7 months of follow-up, which was similar to DAS28-SR. In the 63 patients with B-SR, a similar pattern was observed. The follow-up to outcomes of the 50 patients who met both SR definitions was similar, but the absence of fatigue and physical component SF-36 normalization were achieved earlier in B-SR patients (p <= 0.02).

Chemokines affecting monocytes\/macrophages are considered potential therapeutic targets, but no studies of the effects of blocking the chemokine repertoire in humans with a chronic inflammatory disease have been reported. OBJECTIVE: To carry out a double blind, placebo controlled, phase Ib clinical trial with a specific, oral CCR1 antagonist. METHODS: 16 patients with active rheumatoid arthritis (RA) were randomised 3:1 to active:placebo treatment for 14 days. Synovial biopsy specimens were obtained on days 1 and 15. Immunohistochemistry was used to detect the presence of various cell types before and after treatment and the results measured by digital image analysis. Results before and after treatment were compared by paired t test, and a two sample t test was used to compare the changes from baseline in the two groups. RESULTS: All patients completed the study. A significant reduction in the number of macrophages (p=0.016), intimal macrophages (p=0.026), and CCR1+cells (p=0.049) in patients treated with the chemokine antagonist compared with the placebo group occurred in the synovium. Significant decreases in overall cellularity, intimal lining layer cellularity, CD4+ T cells, and CD8+ T cells also occurred in treated patients. Cells lacking CCR1 were not affected. Trends towards clinical improvement were seen in the treated patients but not in the placebo group. Severe side effects were not reported.

        "Abstract":"BACKGROUND: To investigate whether intensive treatment with methotrexate (MTX) according to a strict protocol and a computerised decision program is more beneficial compared to conventional treatment with MTX in early rheumatoid arthritis. METHODS: In a two-year multicentre open label strategy trial, 299 patients with early rheumatoid arthritis were randomly assigned to the intensive strategy group or the conventional strategy group. Patients in both groups received MTX, the aim of treatment being remission. Patients in the intensive treatment group came to the outpatient clinic once every month; adjustment of the MTX dosage was tailored to the individual patient on the basis of predefined response criteria, using a computerised decision program. Patients of the conventional strategy group came to the outpatient clinic once every three months; they were treated according to common practice. Cyclosporine was added if patients had an inadequate response to maximal tolerated MTX doses. RESULTS: Seventy six (50%) patients in the intensive strategy group achieved at least one period of remission during the two year trial, versus 55 patients (37%) in the conventional strategy group (p = 0.03). Areas under the curve for nearly all clinical variables were significantly lower-that is, there was a better clinical effect for the intensive treatment group compared with the conventional treatment group. CONCLUSION: The results of this study show that it is possible to substantially enhance the clinical efficacy early in the course of the disease by intensifying treatment with MTX, aiming for remission, tailored to the individual patient.

METHODS: Seventy-five consecutive newly diagnosed patients with RA were prospectively enrolled. We used 3 models in which discordance between PGA and EGA at 12 months was set at 5 mm, 10 mm, or 20 mm. We adopted 10 mm as representative and examined time course changes in clinical variables over 12 months. RESULTS: No significant difference was found between the concordance and the higher PGA groups regarding baseline characteristics and treatment. At 12 months, EGA, swollen joint count, and inflammatory marker values were not different, but pain visual analog scale and tender joint count were significantly higher in the higher PGA group, and the Health Assessment Questionnaire improved less. In the 10 mm and 20 mm models, the structural remission rate was significantly lower in the higher PGA group and the rapid radiological progression rate significantly higher. The discrepancy was already significant at 3 months. CONCLUSION: In newly diagnosed RA, PGA at 12 months may be more sensitive for indicating progressive joint destruction and functional impairment when compared with EGA, and there is a discrepancy directed toward a worse assessment by patients.",

        "Abstract":"OBJECTIVE: To test the efficacy of standardised monitoring using the disease activity index DAS28 versus usual care on disease modifying antirheumatic drug (DMARD) prescription and disease activity in rheumatoid arthritis. METHODS: A 24 week cluster randomised trial. Rheumatology outpatient centres were randomised to systematic monitoring of disease activity using the DAS28 (12 centres, 205 patients) or usual care (12 centres, 179 patients). The aim for the DAS group was to reach a DAS28 score of < or =3.2 by changes in DMARD treatment, at the discretion of the rheumatologist and the patient. RESULTS: At baseline, disease activity was the same in both groups, with an overall mean (SD) DAS28 of 4.5 (1.2); 13% of the patients had a DAS28 of < or =3.2. At 24 weeks, 31% of patients in the DAS group had a DAS28 < or =3.2, while in the usual care centres this was 16% (p = 0.028). DMARDs were changed on average in 18% of visits in the DAS centres; in the 12 usual care centres they were changed on 8% of the visits (p = 0.013). The doses of methotrexate, sulfasalazine, and corticosteroids appeared to be higher in the DAS centres than in the usual care centres, but the differences were not significant.

METHODS AND RESULTS: Soluble interleukin 2 receptor titres (median 1500 U\/ml) in 40 patients with MTX-BLPD were lower than those of 24 RA patients with non-MTX- associated (non-MTX) BLPD (5731 U\/ml) and 15 with control diffuse large B cell lymphoma (DLBCL, 5918 U\/ml) (P < 0.01). Using in-situ hybridization, Epstein-Barr virus (EBV) was detected in tumour cells of 25 of 40 RA patients with MTX-BLPD (63%). Immunohistologically, BCL2 expression was detected in 35% of patients with MTX-BLPD, which was lower than 93% of control DLBCL patients (P < 0.01). Eleven patients with EBV(+) MTX-BLPD (44%) showed remission after MTX withdrawal. In RA patients with clinical stage III\/IV BLPD, 15 with rituximab (R)+ cytotoxic therapies pursued better prognosis than 10 with R- cytotoxic therapies (P < 0.05). Among the 15 patients, seven with MTX-BLPD showed better overall survival than nine control DLBCL patients (P < 0.01). CONCLUSIONS: In RA patients with MTX-BLPD, immunosuppression by MTX, EBV infection and low BCL2 expression in tumour cells may play roles in tumorigenesis and tumour regression. R+ cytotoxic therapies as well as MTX withdrawal were highly effective in these patients. Copyright © 2014 John Wiley & Sons Ltd.",

        "Abstract":"Psoriasis is a chronic inflammatory skin disease that can lead to significant physical and psychologic distress for patients. Psoriatic arthritis (PsA), originally thought to be quite a mild disorder, is now recognized as a progressive and destructive arthritis. To date, therapies for both these conditions have been non-specific and unable to maintain long-lasting remission. In addition, many of the current therapies have significant adverse effects, limiting their usefulness. However, elucidation of the pathogenesis of psoriasis and PsA at a molecular level and the development of selective biologic agents have led to an enormous expansion of the armamentarium available to psoriasis patients. Two agents (infliximab and etanercept) selectively block the role of the cytokine tumor necrosis factor (TNF)-alpha and have proved effective in clinical trials in the treatment of both the skin and the joint manifestations of psoriasis. A third anti-TNF alpha agent (adalimumab Humira) is licensed for the treatment of rheumatoid arthritis; however, no studies have been published to date on its use in PsA or psoriasis. It is known that TNF alpha is elevated in both the skin and synovium of psoriatic patients and the effectiveness of its blockade by these two agents in psoriasis and PsA confirms its role in their pathogenesis. Randomized, double-blind, placebo-controlled trials have been performed with both agents in the treatment of psoriasis and PsA; in the case of etanercept these have been to support US FDA approval for use in psoriatic arthropathy. These studies are supported by smaller cohorts in open-label studies and anecdotal reports in the literature. Anti-TNF alpha therapy has proved to have disease-reducing activity in PsA and psoriasis and appears to be well tolerated. These studies have generally featured small numbers of patients and, until a larger cohort of treated patients is available, vigilance must be exercised. A considerable body of post-marketing safety data exists on the use of infliximab in rheumatoid arthritis and Crohn disease and for etanercept in rheumatoid arthritis and PsA. Certain issues, particularly the risk of infection, have emerged as features of the use of these agents. It remains to be seen whether effects seen in other disease entities may be extrapolated to psoriatic patients. More long-term data and experience are needed to define the role of anti-TNF alpha agents in the management of psoriasis and PsA. In particular, more studies are required to elucidate the finer points of co-medication; in some studies both agents have been used with other medications but there have been no formal trials of various possible combinations.

        "Published":"2002 Oct",
        "Abstract":"OBJECTIVE: To assess the possible clinical and biological rescue of rheumatoid arthritis (RA) in 16 patients who were still active despite intensive combination therapy after receiving infliximab following the Anti-Tumour necrosis factor Trial in Rheumatoid Arthritis with Concomitant Therapy (ATTRACT) schedule. METHODS: Sixteen patients who were still active despite combination therapy with optimal doses of methotrexate (MTX 15-17.5 mg\/week) and cyclosporin A (CsA 2.5-3.5 mg\/day) received infliximab. Ten received their combination plus infliximab (Combi), and six received infliximab plus MTX alone (Mono). The follow-up was carried out for 30 weeks in all patients and for 46 weeks in eight. Efficacy and safety were examined. RESULTS: At entry, the mean disease activity score (DAS) was 5.6 (all patients had a DAS >3.7). After therapy, eight of 10 patients in Combi and four out of six in Mono showed an improvement of >50% in the initial swollen joint count, yet only one patient reached 50% improvement in the initial DAS after 30 weeks, and one patient had a DAS <2.4 (low disease activity). Of the eight patients who reached 46 weeks of follow-up, three showed an improvement in DAS of 50% and two had a DAS <2.4. When considering the change over time, the difference between DAS at entry and at week 30 was statistically significant only in patients receiving MTX plus CsA, while it was not significant in those receiving MTX only. Two patients developed recurrent febrile upper respiratory infections in the Combi therapy group, while two had a single febrile infection in the MTX alone group. Two patients became strongly anti-cardiolipin positive (IgM >40 MPL) and one developed a coronary syndrome. CONCLUSION: Infliximab can be added incrementally to MTX plus CsA, with favourable results in terms of efficacy and safety over time in severe rapidly aggressive and progressive RA. Finally, minor evidence emerged for a stronger efficacy of the Combi treatment compared with Mono.",

        "Published":"2002 Jul",
        "Abstract":"Rheumatoid arthritis (RA) is a common cause of disability in the western population, with an annual incidence of 0.05% and a prevalence of 1%. Although a small percentage of patients go into natural remission, the untreated disease progresses to cause disability, morbidity and early mortality. Unravelling of the cytokine network in the pathogenesis of RA has led to the development of drugs that target these cytokines and prevent joint damage. Three biological anticytokine agents, etanercept, infliximab and anakinra, are now available for use in RA. More experience will quantify their safety and benefits. The potency of the older disease-modifying antirheumatic drugs (DMARDs), such as methotrexate and sulfasalazine, is also being realised, especially when used early in the disease process and in combination. Leflunomide is a new DMARD with efficacy similar to methotrexate and sulfasalazine. Symptomatic treatment of RA with nonsteroidal anti-inflammatory drugs has also undergone a revolution with the availability of a new class of COX-2-specific inhibitors. These drugs control inflammation and provide pain relief with less GI toxicity. Management of comorbid conditions associated with RA and its treatment (i.e., osteoporosis, cardiovascular and lung disease) has also become a priority for the rheumatologist. It is hoped that more aggressive use of conventional DMARDs and biological agents will result in less disability and a higher proportion of patients achieving remission. [References: 67]",

        "Published":"2016 Dec",
        "Abstract":"OBJECTIVE: The Disease Activity Score based on 28 joints (DAS28) has been widely used in clinical practice and research studies of rheumatoid arthritis (RA). The objective of this study was to evaluate the discordance in the DAS28 based on the erythrocyte sedimentation rate (ESR) versus C-reactive protein (CRP) levels in Korean patients with RA. METHODS: From August to December 2011, 540 patients with RA who visited two rheumatology clinics affiliated with Hallym University (Korea) and had at least one DAS28 evaluation were examined. RESULTS: The mean age of the included patients was 53 years, and 82% were female. The mean duration of disease was 32.9 +\/- 41.2 months. The mean DAS28-ESR was higher than the DAS28-CRP (3.65 vs. 3.44; P < 0.001). In the DAS28-ESR group, 126 patients (23.3%) satisfied the criteria for remission versus 134 (24.8%) in the DAS28-CRP group. High disease activity was determined in 80 (14.8%) patients in the DAS28-ESR group and in 43 (8.0%) in the DAS28-CRP group. A comparison of the two groups with respect to four DAS28 disease activity categories showed agreement in 344 patients (63.7%; kappa = 0.45). In classifying patients as European League Against Rheumatism (EULAR) responders, agreement between the two methods was shown in 56 patients (71.8%; kappa = 0.76). When disagreements between the two scores occurred, more patients had a better EULAR response based on the DAS28-ESR than on the DAS28-CRP (19.2% vs. 8.9%, respectively). CONCLUSION: The discordance between the ESR-based and CRP-based DAS28 could affect clinical treatment decisions for patients with RA.

        "Published":"2004",
        "Abstract":"Several lines of research indicate that serotonin (5-hydroxytryptamine, 5-HT) and 5-HT receptors may play a part in the pathogenesis of chronic inflammatory rheumatic conditions like rheumatoid arthritis (RA) and scleroderma\/progressive systemic sclerosis (PSS). In this paper, case reports on two patients with RA who were successfully treated with 5-HT3 receptor antagonist tropisetron were presented. Short-term oral tropisetron (5-10 mg\/d) induced either remission of RA or improvement in RA-related symptoms, which lasted for several weeks or months after the treatment was discontinued. Interestingly, tropisetron was effective in a patient with refractory rheumatoid vasculitis, which is a severe complication that requires high-dose glucocorticoids in most cases. The beneficial effect of 5-HT3 receptor antagonists in RA and PSS suggests that this class of drugs may have potential in the treatment of chronic inflammatory rheumatic conditions. Double blind, placebo-controlled studies are urgently needed to confirm the efficacy and tolerance of 5-HT3 receptor antagonists in larger cohorts of patients.",

        "Abstract":"OBJECTIVE: To examine whether magnetic resonance imaging (MRI) findings at baseline predict radiographic progression in early-stage rheumatoid arthritis (RA) patients who have achieved sustained good clinical response. METHODS: This is a sub-analysis from the one-year observational study of Nagasaki University Early Arthritis Cohort. Definition of 'good clinical response' was a decrement of disease activity score (DAS) 28  1.2 at three months with achievement of DAS28 remission through 6-12 months. Gd-enhanced MRI of both wrists and finger joints were examined at baseline and scored using rheumatoid arthritis magnetic resonance imaging score (RAMRIS). Annual increment of Genant-modified Sharp score (GSS) > 0 was defined as 'radiographic progression'. Predictors of radiographic progression were determined by logistic regression analysis. RESULTS: Twenty-four subjects were selected in the present study. Each median RAMRIS synovitis, bone edema, bone erosion, and GSS at baseline were 6.5, 0.5, 0, and 0, respectively. Five patients developed radiographic progression at one year. Multivariate logistic regression analysis has shown that RAMRIS bone erosion at baseline is the only independent predictor of radiographic progression at one year (p = .032). CONCLUSIONS: Our data suggest that MRI bone erosion predicts poor radiographic outcome of early-stage RA even if it has been successfully treated.",

        "Abstract":"OBJECTIVES: To investigate the duration of remission and low disease activity (LDA) after cessation of tocilizumab (TCZ) treatment in rheumatoid arthritis patients who showed remission or LDA as assessed by DAS28 in response to preceding TCZ monotherapy, and to explore the factors contributing to prolonged efficacy duration. METHODS: Disease activity was monitored for 56 weeks. The rate of continued efficacy was estimated by Kaplan-Meier curves. RESULTS: A total of 187 patients were eligible. At baseline of this study, median disease duration was 7.8 years, preceding TCZ treatment period was 4.0 years and DAS28 was 1.5. The rate of continued LDA at 52 weeks was 13.4 % according to the Kaplan-Meier estimate. 19 patients (10 %) were completely drug-free and 17 patients (9.1 %) fulfilled DAS28 remission at 52 weeks. Multivariate Cox regression analysis identified low serum IL-6 and normalisation of MMP-3 levels at cessation of TCZ as independent predictive markers for longer duration of LDA. In patients with low serum IL-6 (<12.9 pg\/mL) and normal MMP-3 levels, the rate of continued LDA reached 38.0 % at 52 weeks. CONCLUSIONS: TCZ monotherapy may induce biologics-free remission or LDA without concomitant use of synthetic DMARDs. Serum levels of IL-6 and MMP-3 are useful markers for identifying patients who could discontinue TCZ without acute disease flare.",

        "Published":"2017 Sep 29",
        "Abstract":"BACKGROUND: Comorbidities may contribute to disease activity and treatment response in rheumatoid arthritis (RA) patients. We defined a somatization comorbidity phenotype (SCP) and examined its influence on response to certolizumab pegol (CZP) using data from the PREDICT trial. METHODS: Patients in PREDICT were randomized to the patient-reported Routine Assessment of Patient Index Data 3 (RAPID3) or physician-based Clinical Disease Activity Index (CDAI) for treatment response assessment. Post-hoc analyses identified patients with the SCP, which included diagnosis of depression, fibromyalgia\/myalgias, and\/or use of medications indicated for treatment of depression, anxiety, or neuropathic pain. The effect of the SCP on RAPID3 or CDAI response at week 12 and low disease activity (LDA; Disease Activity Score in 28 joints based on erythrocyte sedimentation rate <= 3.2) at week 52, in week-12 responders, was analyzed using non-parametric analysis of covariance (ANCOVA). RESULTS: At baseline, 43% (313\/733) of patients met the SCP classification. Patients with the SCP were 9% more likely to withdraw from the trial. American College of Rheumatology 20% (ACR20), ACR50, and ACR70 responses were 5-14% lower among those with the SCP, and 11% more patients reported adverse events (AEs). Patients without SCP in the CDAI arm were twice as likely to achieve LDA at week 52 compared with those with SCP (32% versus 16%). No differentiation by SCP was observed in the RAPID3 arm (pooled result 21.5%). CONCLUSIONS: We operationalized a potentially important somatization comorbidity phenotype in a trial setting that was associated with a substantially lower likelihood of treatment response and a higher frequency of AEs. Including large numbers of patients with this phenotype in RA trials may reduce the measured clinical effectiveness of a new molecule. TRIAL REGISTRATION: ClinicalTrials.gov, NCT01255761 .

        "Abstract":"BACKGROUND: The chance of a good response in RA is attenuated in previous anti-TNF users who start new anti-TNF therapy compared to biologic naive patients. In active RA, those with previous anti-TNF exposure compared to anti-TNF naive may have different baseline disease activity and patient perceptions when starting a new anti-TNF treatment that could explain the observed response differences. MATERIAL\/METHODS: The aim of this study was a post hoc analysis of baseline characteristics of patients enrolled in the Optimization of Adalimumab study that was a treat to target vs. routine care study in patients initiating adalimumab. As per the protocol, a maximum of 20% anti-TNF experienced patients were enrolled in the 300 patient trial. Twelve (4.0%) were excluded who previously used other biologics. Baseline characteristics including age, gender, tender and swollen joint counts, disease activity (DAS28), function (HAQ-DI), patient global assessment, patient satisfaction with current treatment, and inflammatory markers (CRP, ESR), were compared between previously anti-TNF experienced [etanercept or infliximab (EXP)], and anti-TNF naive patients (NAIVE). RESULTS: The mean (SD) age was 54.8 (13.3) years; 81.0% were female, and 237 (79.0%) were anti-TNF naive while 51 (17.0%) patients were anti-TNF experienced (29 with etanercept, 16 with infliximab, and 6 for both). The mean (SD) baseline in EXP versus NAIVE groups respectively was: CRP=21.7(32.9) vs. 17.5(20.7); ESR=28.7(22.5) vs. 29.8(20.4); SJC=10.5(6.0) vs. 10.7(5.6); TJC=12.8(7.1) vs. 12.3(7.3); and DAS28=6.0(1.2) vs. 5.8(1.1). None of the between-group differences were statistically significant, however, the HAQ-DI in EXP was 1.7(0.6) compared to 1.5(0.7) for the NAIVE (P=0.021). Additionally, EXP patients had a higher patient global score [71.3(26.1) vs. 61.9(26.2), P=0.021]. CONCLUSIONS: Although anti-TNF naive and experienced patients who initiated adalimumab were similar, with respect to several baseline characteristics, significant differences in subjective measures were observed, which may indicate more severe patient measures (function and global disease activity) in anti-TNF experienced patients.",

        "Abstract":"Methotrexate (MTX) exhibits large inter-individual and inter-ethnic differences in the dose required for its anti-rheumatic effect. To maintain low disease activity, patients may require increased MTX doses or co-administration of biologic disease-modifying anti-rheumatic drugs (bDMARDs). The availability of a marker predicting the effect of MTX will make it possible to increase the MTX dose and prescribe bDMARDs to patients at an early stage. To establish individualized medication for rheumatoid arthritis (RA), we investigated genetic polymorphisms of the folate pathway in Japanese RA patients. Eighty-nine patients were treated with MTX alone (MTX group). MTX and bDMARDs were co-administered to 81 patients because of insufficient MTX efficacy (MTX + bDMARDs group); an equally stable therapeutic effect was achieved in both groups. Polymorphism analyses using bDMARD co-treatment as the objective variable revealed a significant association between age and the G80A polymorphism of the reduced folate carrier 1 gene (RFC1) as an explanatory variable. Compared to patients with the A allele, patients with the G allele may have less intracellular MTX uptake and, therefore, poor efficacy; a greater number of them were found to be bDMARD concomitant cases. The results of this study suggest that the RFC1 G80A polymorphism may be a useful marker for predicting MTX efficacy in Japanese patients with RA.",
