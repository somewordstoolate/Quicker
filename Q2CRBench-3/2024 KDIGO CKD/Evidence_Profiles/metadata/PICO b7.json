    "Explanations": {
        "a": "Only some of the 7 studies reported on outcome.",
        "b": "There were only 91 events across the 5945 participants enrolled in the 3 trials. The total number of events is lower than the number needed to reach the optimal information size (i.e., 300).",
        "c": "There were some concerns with the risk of bias, particularly with the reporting of selected results and the potential for missing data.",
        "d": "There was some statistical heterogeneity in the meta-analysis results (I2 = 50%).",
        "e": "Only one study addressed this outcome for this comparison.",
        "f": "The total number of events among the participants enrolled in the trial is estimated to be less than the number needed to reach the optimal information size (i.e., 300). The number of events and the number of participants were not reported."
