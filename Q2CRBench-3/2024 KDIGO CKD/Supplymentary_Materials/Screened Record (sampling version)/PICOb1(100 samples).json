        "Abstract":"AIMS: Hyperkalaemia frequently leads to interruption and discontinuation of neurohormonal antagonists, which may worsen heart failure prognosis. Some studies suggested that sodium-glucose cotransporter 2 inhibitors reduce hyperkalaemia, an effect that may have important clinical implications. This analysis evaluates the effect of empagliflozin on the occurrence of hyper- and hypokalaemia in HF.\nMETHODS AND RESULTS: EMPEROR-Pooled (i.e. EMPEROR-Reduced and EMPEROR-Preserved combined) included 9583 patients with available serum potassium levels at baseline (98.6% of the total EMPEROR-Pooled population, n = 9718). Hyperkalaemia was identified by investigators' reports of adverse events, and by a laboratory serum potassium value above 5.5 mmol\/L and 6.0 mmol\/L. The main outcome was a composite of investigator-reported hyperkalaemia or initiation of potassium binders. Patients with high potassium at baseline were more frequently diagnosed with diabetes and ischaemic HF aetiology and had lower left ventricular ejection fraction and estimated glomerular filtration rate but were more frequently treated with sacubitril\/valsartan or mineralocorticoid receptor antagonists. Empagliflozin (compared with placebo) reduced the composite of investigator-reported hyperkalaemia or initiation of potassium binders [6.5% vs. 7.7%, hazard ratio (HR) 0.82, 95% confidence interval (CI) 0.71-0.95, P = 0.01]. Empagliflozin reduced hyperkalaemia rates regardless of the definition used (serum potassium >5.5 mmol\/l: 8.6% vs. 9.9%, HR 0.85, 95% CI 0.74-0.97, P = 0.017; serum potassium >6.0 mmol\/l: 1.9% vs. 2.9%, HR 0.62, 95% CI 0.48-0.81, P < 0.001). The incidence of hypokalaemia (investigator-reported or serum potassium <3.0 mmol\/l) was not significantly increased with empagliflozin.\nCONCLUSIONS: Empagliflozin reduced the incidence of hyperkalaemia without significant increase in hypokalaemia.",

        "Abstract":"AIM: To compare the effects of sodium-glucose co-transporter-2 (SGLT2) inhibitors and dipeptidyl peptidase-4 inhibitors on ectopic fat accumulation and tissue-specific insulin sensitivity.\nMATERIALS AND METHODS: This randomized controlled trial enrolled 44 patients with type 2 diabetes (T2D) and non-alcoholic fatty liver disease (NAFLD). They were randomly assigned to receive either empagliflozin 10 mg\/day or sitagliptin 100 mg\/day for 12 weeks. The primary endpoint was the change in intrahepatic lipid content (IHL) measured using proton magnetic resonance spectroscopy ( H-MRS). The secondary endpoints included intramuscular and extramuscular lipid content seen in  H-MRS, body composition seen through dual-energy X-ray absorptiometry and tissue-specific insulin sensitivity shown through hyperinsulinaemic-euglycaemic clamp using stable isotopic glucose. Liver biopsy samples were pathologically evaluated at baseline.\nRESULTS: At baseline, the mean duration of diabetes, HbA1c level and IHL were 3.7 years, 7.2% and 20.9%, respectively. The median NAFLD activity score was 3.0. IHL was significantly more decreased in the empagliflozin group than that in the sitagliptin group (between-group difference was -5.2% ± 1.1% and -1.9% ± 1.2%, respectively, (95% confidence interval); -3.3 (-6.5, -0.1), P = .044). However, there were no significant between-group differences in the change of insulin sensitivity in the liver, muscle or adipose tissues. Interestingly, hepatic insulin sensitivity was significantly increased only in the empagliflozin group and was significantly negatively associated with the change in IHL.\nCONCLUSIONS: Empagliflozin significantly improves hepatic steatosis compared with sitagliptin, and this may protect against subsequent hepatic insulin resistance. Early administration of SGLT2 inhibitors is preferable for T2D patients with NAFLD.",

        "Abstract":"BACKGROUND: Effective diuretic regimens using loop diuretics in patients with acute decompensated heart failure are often limited by the development of worsening kidney function. Sodium-glucose cotransporter-2 inhibitors induce glucosuria and sodium excretion with nephroprotective effects in patients with stable heart failure but their role in acute decompensated heart failure is unclear.\nMETHODS: In this single-center, prospective, double-blind, placebo-controlled, randomized study, we randomly assigned patients with acute decompensated heart failure to empagliflozin 25 mg daily or placebo in addition to standard decongestive treatments that included loop diuretics. The primary end point was cumulative urine output over 5 days. Secondary end points included diuretic efficiency, dynamics in markers of kidney function and injury, and NT-proBNP (N-terminal pro-B-type natriuretic peptide).\nRESULTS: Sixty patients were randomized within 12 hours of hospitalization for acute decompensated heart failure. Addition of empagliflozin daily to standard medical treatment of acute decompensated heart failure resulted in a 25% increase in cumulative urine output over 5 days (median 10.8 versus 8.7 L mL in placebo, group difference estimation 2.2 L [95% CI, 8.4 to 3.6]; =0.003). Empagliflozin increased diuretic efficiency compared with placebo (14.1 mL urine per milligram furosemide equivalent [95% CI, 0.6-27.7]; =0.041) without affecting markers of renal function (estimated glomerular filtration rate, 51±19 versus 54±17 mL\/min per 1.73 m²; =0.599) or injury (total urinary protein, 492±845 versus 503±847 mg\/g creatinine; =0.975; and urinary α1-microglobulin, 55.4±38.6 versus 31.3±33.6 mg\/g creatinine; =0.066) with more pronounced decrease in NT-proBNP in the empagliflozin group compared with placebo (-1861 versus -727.2 pg\/mL after 5 days; quotient in slope, 0.89 [95% CI, 0.83-0.95]; <0.001).

        "Abstract":"The treatment of patients with type 2 diabetes is typically accompanied by hypoglycemia, if insulin or derivatives of sulfonylurea are used within the treatment. Apart from the fact that hypoglycemias are the major obstacle to achieving the desirable compensation of diabetes, hypoglycemia also has a number of serious clinical consequences. A long term serious hypoglycemia may lead to a sudden death, heart attack or irreversible brain damage. Clinically significant are also the light or asymptomatic hypoglycemias which in a considerably negative way affect the patient's quality of life. The use of modern technologies in continuous monitoring of glycemias has shown that the occurrence of asymptomatic hypoglycemias is much higher than we anticipated and that they largely involve nocturnal hypoglycemia. Hypoglycemia is associated with an increased level of depression, anxiety, dissatisfaction with the treatment and with a greater number of physician office visits. Nocturnal hypoglycemia has a negative impact on the quality of sleep, it may impair cognitive functions and performance efficiency next day. The prevention of hypoglycemia is therefore one of the basic goals of diabetes treatment and the low risk of hypoglycemia is among the main requirements that we place on the newly developed antidiabetic drugs. The negligible risk of hypoglycemia, which is comparable to placebo both in monotherapy and in most combinations with the antidiabetic drugs available today, is evidenced by the data from the studies undertaken with empagliflozin. It shows that the low risk of hypoglycemia is one of the benefits of gliflozins, the new group of medications with a unique mechanism of effect which has quite recently appeared on our market.",

This population-based retrospective cohort study aimed to determine whether new use of sodium-glucose cotransporter 2 (SGLT2) inhibitors compared with dipeptidyl peptidase 4 (DPP-4) inhibitors was associated with lower dementia risk.\nRESEARCH DESIGN AND METHODS: Ontario residents aged ≥66 years who were new users of an SGLT2 inhibitor or a DPP-4 inhibitor from 1 July 2016 to 31 March 2021 entered the cohort. Incident dementia was identified using a validated algorithm for Alzheimer's disease and related dementias. Propensity score-weighted Cox proportional hazards models were used to obtain adjusted hazard ratios (aHR) and CIs for time to incident dementia. To address reverse causality and disease latency, the observation window started at 1-year lag time from cohort entry. The primary analysis followed intention-to-treat exposure definition, and a secondary as-treated analysis was performed.\nRESULTS: Among 106,903 individuals, SGLT2 inhibitors compared with DPP-4 inhibitors were associated with lower risk of dementia (14.2\/1,000 person-years; aHR 0.80 [95% CI 0.71-0.89]) over a mean follow-up of 2.80 years from cohort entry. When stratified by different SGLT2 inhibitors, dapagliflozin exhibited the lowest risk (aHR 0.67 [95% CI 0.53-0.84]), followed by empagliflozin (aHR 0.78 [95% CI 0.69-0.89]), whereas canagliflozin showed no association (aHR 0.96 [95% CI 0.80-1.16]). The as-treated analysis observed a larger association (aHR 0.66 [95% CI 0.57-0.76]) than the intention-to-treat analysis.\nCONCLUSIONS: SGLT2 inhibitors showed an association with lower dementia risk in older people with T2D.

The present post hoc analyses compared the durability of these effects over short- and long-term follow-up in patients with T2DM who were inadequately controlled with metformin (≥1500 mg\/day) and who were receiving either dapagliflozin (10 mg\/day) or saxagliptin (5 mg\/day). Failure of glycaemiccontrol was assessed using the slope of the change in HbA1c from baseline-over-time regression line (coefficient of failure [CoF]). CoF was compared directly (dapagliflozin vs saxagliptin) over the short term (NCT01606007, 24 weeks) and indirectly (placebo-adjusted) over the long term (NCT00528879 and NCT00121667, 102 weeks).

Potassium changes were further evaluated based on baseline therapy with anti-hypertensive agents that interfere with potassium excretion (renin-angiotensin aldosterone system-acting agents and\/or potassium-sparing diuretics).\nRESULTS: Mean percent changes from baseline in potassium with canagliflozin 100 and 300 mg and placebo were 0.6%, 1.0%, and 0.5%, respectively (Week 26; Population 1); and 1.7%, 2.8%, and 0.7%, respectively (Week 18\/26; Population 2). The proportion of patients who had potassium elevations meeting pre-defined outlier criteria (>5.4 mmol\/L [5.4 mEq\/L] and >15% increase from baseline) with canagliflozin 100 and 300 mg and placebo was 4.5%, 6.8%, and 4.7% (Population 1); and 5.2%, 9.1%, and 5.5% (Population 2). In both populations, potassium elevations were usually <6.5 mmol\/L for patients treated with canagliflozin or placebo; elevations ≥6.5 mmol\/L were rare but more frequent in patients taking anti-hypertensive agents that affect potassium excretion in both the canagliflozin and placebo groups. Small mean percent changes in sodium, bicarbonate, and calcium were seen across groups in both populations; small mean percent increases in magnesium and phosphate were seen with canagliflozin vs placebo, but without an increase in patients meeting outlier criteria. Adverse events related to changes in electrolytes were low across groups.\nCONCLUSIONS: In patients with T2DM, canagliflozin was generally associated with small mean percent changes in serum electrolytes. Infrequent episodes of potassium elevation occurred with canagliflozin 300 mg, but occurred more often in patients with reduced eGFR.",

The SIMPLE trial (The Effects of Empagliflozin on Myocardial Flow Reserve in Patients With Type 2 Diabetes Mellitus) investigated the effects of empagliflozin on myocardial flow reserve (MFR) reflecting microvascular perfusion, in patients with type 2 diabetes mellitus at high cardiovascular disease risk. Methods and Results We randomized 90 patients to either empagliflozin 25 mg once daily or placebo for 13 weeks, as add-on to standard therapy. The primary outcome was change in MFR at week 13, quantified by Rubidium-82 positron emission tomography\/computed tomography. The secondary key outcomes were changes in resting rate-pressure product adjusted MFR, changes to myocardial flow during rest and stress, and reversible cardiac ischemia. Mean baseline MFR was 2.21 (95% CI, 2.08-2.35). There was no change from baseline in MFR at week 13 in either the empagliflozin: 0.01 (95% CI, -0.18 to 0.21) or placebo groups: 0.06 (95% CI, -0.15 to 0.27), with no treatment effect -0.05 (95% CI, -0.33 to 0.23). No effects on the secondary outcome parameters by Rubidium-82 positron emission tomography\/computed tomography was observed. Treatment with empagliflozin reduced hemoglobin A by 0.76% (95% CI, 1.0-0.5; <0.001) and increased hematocrit by 1.69% (95% CI, 0.7-2.6; <0.001). Conclusions Empagliflozin did not improve MFR among patients with type 2 diabetes mellitus and high cardiovascular disease risk. The present study does not support that short-term improvement in MFR explains the reduction in cardiovascular events observed in the outcome trials.

        "Abstract":"BACKGROUND: Traditionally, clinical trials evaluating effects of a new therapy with creatinine-based renal end points use doubling of serum creatinine (equivalent to a 57% eGFR reduction), requiring large sample sizes.\nMETHODS: To assess whether eGFR declines <57% could detect canagliflozin's effects on renal outcomes, we conducted a  study comparing effects of canagliflozin versus placebo on composite renal outcomes using sustained 57%, 50%, 40%, or 30% eGFR reductions in conjunction with ESKD and renal death. Because canagliflozin causes an acute reversible hemodynamic decline in eGFR, we made estimates using all eGFR values as well as estimates that excluded early measures of eGFR influenced by the acute hemodynamic effect.\nRESULTS: Among the 10,142 participants, 93 (0.9%), 161 (1.6%), 352 (3.5%), and 800 (7.9%) participants recorded renal outcomes on the basis of 57%, 50%, 40%, or 30% eGFR reduction, respectively, during a mean follow-up of 188 weeks. Compared with a 57% eGFR reduction (risk ratio [RR], 0.51; 95% confidence interval [95% CI], 0.34 to 0.77), the effect sizes were progressively attenuated when using 50% (RR, 0.61; 95% CI, 0.45 to 0.83), 40% (RR, 0.70; 95% CI, 0.57 to 0.86), or 30% (RR, 0.81; 95% CI, 0.71 to 0.93) eGFR reductions. In analyses that controlled for the acute hemodynamic fall in eGFR, effect sizes were comparable, regardless of whether a 57%, 50%, 40%, or 30% eGFR reduction was used. Estimated sample sizes for studies on the basis of lesser eGFR reductions were much reduced by controlling for this early hemodynamic effect.\nCONCLUSIONS: Declines in eGFR <57% may provide robust estimates of canagliflozin's effects on renal outcomes if the analysis controls for the drug's acute hemodynamic effect.\nCLINICAL TRIAL REGISTRY NAME AND REGISTRATION NUMBER: CANagliflozin cardioVascular Assessment Study (CANVAS), NCT01032629 and CANVAS-R, NCT01989754.",

        "Abstract":"BACKGROUND: Large trials have shown that sodium glucose co-transporter-2 (SGLT2) inhibitors reduce the risk of adverse kidney and cardiovascular outcomes in patients with heart failure or chronic kidney disease, or with type 2 diabetes and high risk of atherosclerotic cardiovascular disease. None of the trials recruiting patients with and without diabetes were designed to assess outcomes separately in patients without diabetes.\nMETHODS: We did a systematic review and meta-analysis of SGLT2 inhibitor trials. We searched the MEDLINE and Embase databases for trials published from database inception to Sept 5, 2022. SGLT2 inhibitor trials that were double-blind, placebo-controlled, performed in adults (age ≥18 years), large (≥500 participants per group), and at least 6 months in duration were included. Summary-level data used for analysis were extracted from published reports or provided by trial investigators, and inverse-variance-weighted meta-analyses were conducted to estimate treatment effects. The main efficacy outcomes were kidney disease progression (standardised to a definition of a sustained ≥50% decrease in estimated glomerular filtration rate [eGFR] from randomisation, a sustained low eGFR, end-stage kidney disease, or death from kidney failure), acute kidney injury, and a composite of cardiovascular death or hospitalisation for heart failure. Other outcomes were death from cardiovascular and non-cardiovascular disease considered separately, and the main safety outcomes were ketoacidosis and lower limb amputation. This study is registered with PROSPERO, CRD42022351618.\nFINDINGS: We identified 13 trials involving 90 413 participants. After exclusion of four participants with uncertain diabetes status, we analysed 90 409 participants (74 804 [82·7%] participants with diabetes [>99% with type 2 diabetes] and 15 605 [17·3%] without diabetes; trial-level mean baseline eGFR range 37-85 mL\/min per 1·73 m). Compared with placebo, allocation to an SGLT2 inhibitor reduced the risk of kidney disease progression by 37% (relative risk [RR] 0·63, 95% CI 0·58-0·69) with similar RRs in patients with and without diabetes. In the four chronic kidney disease trials, RRs were similar irrespective of primary kidney diagnosis. SGLT2 inhibitors reduced the risk of acute kidney injury by 23% (0·77, 0·70-0·84) and the risk of cardiovascular death or hospitalisation for heart failure by 23% (0·77, 0·74-0·81), again with similar effects in those with and without diabetes. SGLT2 inhibitors also reduced the risk of cardiovascular death (0·86, 0·81-0·92) but did not significantly reduce the risk of non-cardiovascular death (0·94, 0·88-1·02). For these mortality outcomes, RRs were similar in patients with and without diabetes. For all outcomes, results were broadly similar irrespective of trial mean baseline eGFR. Based on estimates of absolute effects, the absolute benefits of SGLT2 inhibition outweighed any serious hazards of ketoacidosis or amputation.\nINTERPRETATION: In addition to the established cardiovascular benefits of SGLT2 inhibitors, the randomised data support their use for modifying risk of kidney disease progression and acute kidney injury, not only in patients with type 2 diabetes at high cardiovascular risk, but also in patients with chronic kidney disease or heart failure irrespective of diabetes status, primary kidney disease, or kidney function.\nFUNDING: UK Medical Research Council and Kidney Research UK.",

Primary endpoint was change in absolute left ventricular mass (LVM), assessed by cardiac magnetic resonance imaging. In the intention-to-treat analysis, dapagliflozin significantly reduced LVM compared with placebo with an absolute mean change of -2.82g [95% confidence interval (CI): -5.13 to -0.51, P = 0.018]. Additional sensitivity analysis adjusting for baseline LVM, baseline BP, weight, and systolic BP change showed the LVM change to remain statistically significant (mean change -2.92g; 95% CI: -5.45 to -0.38, P = 0.025). Dapagliflozin significantly reduced pre-specified secondary endpoints including ambulatory 24-h systolic BP (P = 0.012), nocturnal systolic BP (P = 0.017), body weight (P < 0.001), visceral adipose tissue (VAT) (P < 0.001), subcutaneous adipose tissue (SCAT) (P = 0.001), insulin resistance, Homeostatic Model Assessment of Insulin Resistance (P = 0.017), and high-sensitivity C-reactive protein (hsCRP) (P = 0.049).\nCONCLUSION: Dapagliflozin treatment significantly reduced LVM in people with T2D and LVH. This reduction in LVM was accompanied by reductions in systolic BP, body weight, visceral and SCAT, insulin resistance, and hsCRP. The regression of LVM suggests dapagliflozin can initiate reverse remodelling and changes in left ventricular structure that may partly contribute to the cardio-protective effects of dapagliflozin.\nCLINICALTRIALS.GOV IDENTIFIER: NCT02956811.",

        "Abstract":"BACKGROUND: Sodium-glucose cotransporter 2 inhibitors (SGLT2i) reduce heart failure (HF) in a broad range of populations, but they have not been studied specifically in patients with atrial fibrillation (AF). We aimed to examine the association between SGLT2i eligibility and cardiovascular events in patients with AF to evaluate the potential utility of SGLT2is for AF management.\nMETHODS: We pooled data from 2 randomized controlled trials (RCTs) of patients with AF (RE-LY and ACTIVE-W). Among patients assigned to anticoagulation arms, those meeting the enrollment criteria from at least 1 of the phase 3 SGLT2i RCTs were classified as \"SGLT2i eligible\" and the remainder as \"SGLT2i ineligible.\" The primary outcome was the composite of HF hospitalization or cardiovascular death.\nRESULTS: A total of 21,484 patients with AF (mean age: 71.2 ± 8.8, 36.1% women, median CHADS-VASc Score = 3) were included. The proportion of patients with AF eligible for SGLT2i was 41.2%. SGLT2i-eligible patients had higher rates of cardiovascular death or hospitalization for HF (5.8 vs 3.2 per 100 person-years, P < 0.001), cardiovascular death (3.9 vs 1.5 per 100 person-years, P < 0.001), and hospitalization for HF (2.5 vs 1.9 per 100 person-years, P < 0.001). The age- and sex-adjusted model showed that SGLT2i-eligible patients were at a higher risk of cardiovascular death and hospitalization for HF (hazard ratio [HR], 1.97; 95% confidence interval [CI], 1.79-2.17; P < 0.001), cardiovascular death (HR, 2.75; 95% CI, 2.41-3.13; P < 0.001), and hospitalization for HF (HR, 1.41; 95% CI, 1.23-1.62; P < 0.001) than ineligible patients.\nCONCLUSIONS: Most patients with AF do not currently have indications for SGLT2is but still have substantial risk of cardiovascular events. Future randomized trials should evaluate the efficacy of SGLT2is in patients with AF.",

        "Abstract":"Doubling of serum creatinine (equivalent to a 57% decline in the estimated glomerular filtration rate (eGFR)) is an accepted component of a composite kidney endpoint in clinical trials. Smaller declines in eGFR (40%, 50%) have been applied in several recently conducted clinical trials. Here, we assessed the effects of newer kidney protective agents on endpoints including smaller proportional declines in eGFR to compare relative event rates and the magnitude of observed treatment effects. We performed a post hoc analysis of 4401 patients in the CREDENCE, 4304 in the DAPA-CKD, 5734 in the FIDELIO-DKD, and 3668 in the SONAR trials, which assessed the effects of canagliflozin, dapagliflozin, finerenone and atrasentan in patients with chronic kidney disease. Effects of active therapies versus placebo on alternative composite kidney endpoints incorporating different eGFR decline thresholds (40%, 50%, or 57% eGFR reductions from baseline) with kidney failure or death due to kidney failure were compared. Cox-proportional hazards regression models were used to assess and compare treatment effects. During follow-up, event rates were higher for endpoints incorporating smaller versus larger eGFR decline thresholds. Compared to the treatment effects on kidney failure or death due to kidney failure, the magnitude of relative treatment effects was generally similar when considering composite endpoints incorporating smaller declines in eGFR. Hazard ratios for the four interventions ranged from 0.63 to 0.82 for the endpoint incorporating 40% eGFR decline and 0.59 to 0.76 for the endpoint incorporating 57% eGFR decline. Clinical trials incorporating a 40% eGFR decline in a composite endpoint would require approximately half the number of participants compared to a 57% eGFR decline with equivalent statistical power. Thus, in populations at high risk of CKD progression, the relative effects of newer kidney protective therapies appear generally similar across endpoints based on varying eGFR decline thresholds.",

Studies were included if they investigated drug pharmacology, efficacy, and safety information.\nDATA SYNTHESIS: In addition to standard of care with a renin-angiotensin system inhibitor (RASi), finerenone lowered the risk of kidney disease progression (17.8% vs 21.1%) in patients with type 2 diabetes mellitus and chronic kidney disease compared to placebo. Similarly, finerenone reduced cardiovascular risk in patients with type 2 diabetes mellitus and chronic kidney disease compared to placebo (12.4% vs 14.2%).\nRELEVANCE TO PATIENT CARE AND CLINICAL PRACTICE: It is anticipated that finerenone will be added to therapy after a RASi and a sodium-glucose cotransporter-2 inhibitor, as tolerated, based on adverse events and potassium levels.\nCONCLUSIONS: Finerenone offers a unique approach to further delay the progression of chronic kidney disease in patients with type 2 diabetes mellitus.

        "Published":null,
        "Abstract":"BACKGROUND: SGLT2 inhibition decreases albuminuria and reduces the risk of kidney disease progression in patients with type 2 diabetes. These benefits are unlikely to be mediated by improvements in glycaemic control alone. Therefore, we aimed to examine the kidney effects of the SGLT2 inhibitor dapagliflozin in patients with proteinuric kidney disease without diabetes.\nMETHODS: DIAMOND was a randomised, double-blind, placebo-controlled crossover trial done at six hospitals in Canada, Malaysia, and the Netherlands. Eligible participants were adult patients (aged 18-75 years) with chronic kidney disease, without a diagnosis of diabetes, with a 24-h urinary protein excretion greater than 500 mg and less than or equal to 3500 mg and an estimated glomerular filtration rate (eGFR) of at least 25 mL\/min per 1·73 m, and who were on stable renin-angiotensin system blockade. Participants were randomly assigned (1:1) to receive placebo and then dapagliflozin 10 mg per day or vice versa. Each treatment period lasted 6 weeks with a 6-week washout period in between. Participants, investigators, and study personnel were masked to assignment throughout the trial and analysis. The primary outcome was percentage change from baseline in 24-h proteinuria during dapagliflozin treatment relative to placebo. Secondary outcomes were changes in measured GFR (mGFR; via iohexol clearance), bodyweight, blood pressure, and concentrations of neurohormonal biomarkers. Analyses were done in accordance with the intention-to-treat principle. This study is registered with ClinicalTrials.gov, NCT03190694.\nFINDINGS: Between Nov 22, 2017, and April 5, 2019, 58 patients were screened, of whom 53 (mean age 51 years [SD 13]; 32% women) were randomly assigned (27 received dapagliflozin then placebo and 26 received placebo then dapagliflozin). One patient discontinued during the first treatment period. All patients were included in the analysis. Mean baseline mGFR was 58·3 mL\/min per 1·73 m (SD 23), median proteinuria was 1110 mg per 24 h (IQR 730-1560), and mean HbA was 5·6% (SD 0·4). The difference in mean proteinuria change from baseline between dapagliflozin and placebo was 0·9% (95% CI -16·6 to 22·1; p=0·93). Compared with placebo, mGFR was changed with dapagliflozin treatment by -6·6 mL\/min per 1·73 m (-9·0 to -4·2; p<0·0001) at week 6. This reduction was fully reversible within 6 weeks after dapagliflozin discontinuation. Compared with placebo, bodyweight was reduced by 1·5 kg (0·03-3·0; p=0·046) with dapagliflozin; changes in systolic and diastolic blood pressure and concentrations of neurohormonal biomarkers did not differ significantly between dapagliflozin and placebo treatment. The numbers of patients who had one or more adverse events during dapagliflozin treatment (17 [32%] of 53) and during placebo treatment (13 [25%] of 52) were similar. No hypoglycaemic events were reported and no deaths occurred.\nINTERPRETATION: 6-week treatment with dapagliflozin did not affect proteinuria in patients with chronic kidney disease without diabetes, but did induce an acute and reversible decline in mGFR and a reduction in bodyweight. Long-term clinical trials are underway to determine whether SGLT2 inhibitors can safely reduce the rate of major clinical kidney outcomes in patients with chronic kidney disease with and without diabetes.\nFUNDING: AstraZeneca.",

In the VERTIS SU study, ertugliflozin was evaluated vs glimepiride over 104 weeks. In the VERTIS MET study, ertugliflozin was evaluated vs placebo over 26 weeks; eligible participants were switched from placebo to blinded glimepiride from week 26 to week 104. The glycaemic efficacy of ertugliflozin vs non-ertugliflozin was also assessed in the pooled population.\nMETHODS: Post hoc, exploratory analysis was used to investigate mean changes from baseline in eGFR and UACR over 104 weeks.\nRESULTS: Overall, mean (SD) baseline eGFR was 88.2 (18.8) ml min (1.73 m) and geometric mean (95% CI) of baseline UACR was 1.31 mg\/mmol (1.23, 1.38). At week 6, the changes in eGFR from baseline were -2.3, -2.7 and -0.7 ml min (1.73 m) for the ertugliflozin 5 mg, ertugliflozin 15 mg and non-ertugliflozin groups, respectively. Mean eGFR in the ertugliflozin groups increased over time thereafter, while it decreased in the non-ertugliflozin group. Week 104 changes in eGFR from baseline were -0.2, 0.1 and -2.0 ml min (1.73 m) for the ertugliflozin 5 mg, ertugliflozin 15 mg and non-ertugliflozin groups, respectively. Among 415 patients (21.4% of the cohort) with albuminuria at baseline, the ertugliflozin groups had greater reductions in UACR at all measured time points up to week 104. At week 104, the non-ertugliflozin-corrected difference in UACR (95% CI) was -29.5% (-44.8, -9.8; p < 0.01) for ertugliflozin 5 mg and -37.6% (-51.8, -19.2; p < 0.001) for ertugliflozin 15 mg.

Least squares mean changes from baseline in HbA1 (% [95% CI]) at week 104 were: -0.63 (-0.70, -0.55), -0.71 (-0.78, -0.64) and -0.63 (-0.70, -0.55) in the ertugliflozin 5 mg, ertugliflozin 15 mg and non-ertugliflozin groups, respectively.\nCONCLUSIONS\/INTERPRETATION: Ertugliflozin reduced eGFR at week 6, consistent with the known pharmacodynamic effects of SGLT2 inhibitors on renal function. Over 104 weeks, eGFR values returned to baseline and were higher with ertugliflozin compared with non-ertugliflozin treatment, even though changes in HbA did not differ between the groups.

Sixteen subjects were randomized and completed the study. Ertugliflozin absorption was rapid, with maximum plasma concentrations observed 1 hour after dosing under fasted conditions and 2 to 4 hours after dosing under fed conditions. Following single- and multiple-dose administration, ertugliflozin exhibited dose-proportional exposures with an apparent mean terminal half-life of approximately 9.5 to 11.9 hours. Steady state was reached after 4 once-daily doses. The accumulation ratio based on the area under the plasma concentration-time curve after multiple-dose administration was approximately 1.3 and 1.2 for ertugliflozin 5 mg and 15 mg, respectively. Ertugliflozin was generally well tolerated following administration of single and multiple oral doses of 5 mg and 15 mg in healthy Chinese subjects.

Patients with advanced CKD (CKD stage 3b and 4) are at high or very high cardiovascular risk, and their risk of progressing towards end-stage kidney disease (CKD stage 5) and the need of renal replacement therapy are elevated. Hypertension is a major cause of poor cardiovascular and renal outcomes in severe CKD. Therefore, an adequate control of blood pressure (BP) is mandatory. However, normalizing BP is often challenging in these patients because the clinical management of hypertension in advanced CKD is not well defined and rarely supported by large randomized controlled trials.

In the EMPA-REG OUTCOME trial, empagliflozin, a sodium-glucose cotransporter 2 inhibitor, reduced the risk of major adverse cardiovascular events in patients with type 2 diabetes at high risk for cardiovascular events. We wanted to determine the long-term renal effects of empagliflozin, an analysis that was a prespecified component of the secondary microvascular outcome of that trial.\nMETHODS: We randomly assigned patients with type 2 diabetes and an estimated glomerular filtration rate of at least 30 ml per minute per 1.73 m(2) of body-surface area to receive either empagliflozin (at a dose of 10 mg or 25 mg) or placebo once daily. Prespecified renal outcomes included incident or worsening nephropathy (progression to macroalbuminuria, doubling of the serum creatinine level, initiation of renal-replacement therapy, or death from renal disease) and incident albuminuria.\nRESULTS: Incident or worsening nephropathy occurred in 525 of 4124 patients (12.7%) in the empagliflozin group and in 388 of 2061 (18.8%) in the placebo group (hazard ratio in the empagliflozin group, 0.61; 95% confidence interval, 0.53 to 0.70; P<0.001). Doubling of the serum creatinine level occurred in 70 of 4645 patients (1.5%) in the empagliflozin group and in 60 of 2323 (2.6%) in the placebo group, a significant relative risk reduction of 44%. Renal-replacement therapy was initiated in 13 of 4687 patients (0.3%) in the empagliflozin group and in 14 of 2333 patients (0.6%) in the placebo group, representing a 55% lower relative risk in the empagliflozin group. There was no significant between-group difference in the rate of incident albuminuria. The adverse-event profile of empagliflozin in patients with impaired kidney function at baseline was similar to that reported in the overall trial population.\nCONCLUSIONS: In patients with type 2 diabetes at high cardiovascular risk, empagliflozin was associated with slower progression of kidney disease and lower rates of clinically relevant renal events than was placebo when added to standard care.

        "Abstract":"This review evaluates the potential benefits of sodium-glucose transporter-2 (SGLT-2) inhibitors on symptom burden\/health-related quality of life (HRQoL), functional improvement, hospitalization for heart failure (HHF), cardiovascular mortality (CVM), and all-cause mortality (ACM) in patients with heart failure (HF) with reduced or preserved ejection fraction (EF). We analyzed 12 randomized clinical trials (RCTs) accessed through 11 records and three secondary analyses from PubMed and Scopus following Preferred Reporting Items for Systematic Reviews and Meta-analyses (PRISMA) 2020 guidelines. These studies evaluated 23,389 patients treated with either an SGLT-2 inhibitor or placebo in addition to the standard of care. Four studies recruited diabetic patients, some of whom had HF at the baseline and were evaluated as a subgroup. One study had diabetes and HF present in all patients at the baseline. Ten studies recruited patients with HF at their baseline irrespective of diabetic status. Eight studies evaluated the SGLT-2 inhibitors for a composite of hospitalization for heart failure or cardiovascular mortality (HHF\/CVM) and ACM. Five of these studies showed a decreased risk for HHF\/CVM, and two showed a reduced risk for ACM. One trial showed benefits in patients with heart failure with reduced ejection fraction (HFrEF) only and not in heart failure with preserved ejection fraction (HFpEF). Other studies revealed benefits but did not reach statistical significance. Ten studies assessed the SGLT-2 inhibitors for improvement in symptoms and HRQoL; four demonstrated a significant improvement, three showed a slight improvement, and three did not find any benefit. Five trials evaluated participants' functional progress by assessing for a six-minute walk test (6MWT). Two studies showed a significant increase in the distance walked by the patient, while three others did not. The SGLT-2 inhibitors reduce the risk of HHF\/CVM irrespective of ejection fraction and result in a symptomatic improvement.",

The intervention group received SGLT-2i as add-on treatment to insulin therapy, and the control group received placebos in addition to insulin. We assessed pooled data, including weighted mean differences and 95% confidence intervals (CIs) using a random-effects model.\nRESULTS: A total of 10 randomized controlled trials (n = 5,159) were eligible. The weighted mean differences for systolic blood pressure and diastolic blood pressure were -3.17 mmHg (95% CI -4.53, -1.80, I = 0%) and -1.60 mmHg (95% CI -2.52, -0.69, I = 0%) in the intervention groups. Glycosylated hemoglobin, fasting plasma glucose, postprandial glucose and daily insulin were also lower in the intervention groups, with relative weighted mean differences of -0.49% (95% CI -0.71, -0.28%, I = 92%), -1.10 mmol\/L (95% CI -1.69, -0.51 mmol\/L, I = 84%), -3.63 mmol\/L (95% CI -4.36, -2.89, I = 0%) and -5.42 IU\/day (95% CI -8.12, -2.72, I = 93%). The transformations of uric acid and bodyweight were -26.16 μmol\/L (95% CI -42.14, -10.17, I = 80%) and -2.13 kg (95% CI -2.66, -1.60, I = 83%). The relative risk of hypoglycemia was 1.09 (95% CI 1.02, 1.17, P < 0.01). The relative risks of urinary tract and genital infection were 1.29 (95% CI 1.03, 1.62, P = 0.03) and 5.25 (95% CI 3.55, 7.74, P < 0.01).\nCONCLUSIONS: The results showed that in the intervention group, greater reductions were achieved for blood pressure, glucose control, uric acid and bodyweight.

        "Abstract":"INTRODUCTION: Although sodium-glucose cotransporter-2 (SGLT2) inhibitors have risen in popularity for managing heart failure (HF) and chronic kidney disease (CKD), little guidance is available for the management of patients with an overlap of HF and CKD.\nAREAS COVERED: Following a brief review of the cardiorenal effects of SGLT2 inhibitors, this narrative review focused on the published clinical evidence pertaining to the cardiovascular and renal efficacy of SGLT2 inhibitors in patients with HF and CKD, including both randomized controlled trials and real-world observational studies. Real-world considerations of using SGLT2 inhibitors in these patients were also reviewed.\nEXPERT OPINION: Although no randomized controlled trial has specifically studied the use of SGLT2 inhibitors in patients with HF and CKD, evidence from existing trials is largely sufficient to demonstrate that SGLT2 inhibitors are efficacious in these patients, in whom these agents should be initiated early to maximally slow declines in renal function. Further studies should focus on better guiding the timing of initiating SGLT2 inhibitors, improving these agents' cost-effectiveness, and bettering equity of access to these agents. Further areas of study may include the prognostic implications of SGLT2 inhibitors-induced changes in biomarker levels (e.g. natriuretic peptides), and the potentials of SGLT1 inhibition.",

However, the magnitude and potential heterogeneity of effect across patients with varying types of cardiometabolic and kidney disease is unclear. To examine the effect of SGLT2i on cardiovascular and kidney outcomes among patients with type 2 diabetes mellitus (T2DM), and independent of T2DM status, among patients with heart failure (HF), and chronic kidney disease.\nMETHOD: Medline, Embase, Cochrane library and scientific conferences were searched from inception till September 24, 2020 for randomized controlled trials comparing cardiovascular and kidney outcomes between SGLT2i and placebo. Random effects hazard ratios (HR) with 95% confidence intervals (CIs) were calculated.\nRESULTS: Eight trials with a combined 59,747 patients were included. In the overall population, SGLT2i reduced the risk of all-cause mortality (HR 0.84; 95% CI [0.78-0.91]), cardiovascular mortality (HR 0.84; 95% CI [0.76-0.93]) hospitalization for HF (HR 0.69; 95% CI [0.64-0.74]), myocardial infarction (HR 0.91; 95% CI [0.84-0.99]), and composite kidney outcome (HR 0.62; 95% CI [0.56-0.70]). There was no significant effect on the risk of stroke (HR 0.98; 95% CI [0.86-1.11]). Results were consistent across subgroups stratified by diabetes and HF status. SGLT2i use was not associated with a greater risk of hypoglycemia (OR 0.92; 95% CI [0.84-1.01]) or amputation (OR 1.25; 95% CI [0.97-1.62]). There were 64 diabetic ketoacidosis events with SGLT2i use and 18 with placebo (OR 2.86; 95% CI [1.39-5.86]).\nCONCLUSIONS: In patients with cardiometabolic and kidney disease, SGLT2i improved cardiovascular and kidney outcomes, regardless of T2DM, HF, and\/or CKD status.

The main purpose of this study was to investigate the effect of canagliflozin on circulating active glucagon-like peptide 1 (GLP-1) levels in patients with type 2 diabetes. Patients were randomly divided into a control group (n =15) and a canagliflozin-treated group (n =15). After hospitalization, the canagliflozin-treated group took 100 mg\/day canagliflozin for the entire study, and after 3 days both groups took 20 mg\/day teneligliptin for an additional 3 days. In a meal test, canagliflozin significantly decreased the area under curve (AUC) (0-120 min) for plasma glucose (PG) after 3 days when compared with that at baseline, and addition of teneligliptin to the canagliflozin-treated group further decreased it. A significant decrease in the AUC (0-120 min) for serum insulin by canagliflozin was obtained, but the addition of teneligliptin elevated the AUC, and thus abolished the significant difference from baseline. A significant increase in the AUC (0-120 min) of plasma active GLP-1 by canagliflozin-treatment compared with that at baseline was observed, and the addition of teneligliptin resulted in a further increase. However, canagliflozin-treatment did not change the AUC (0-120 min) of plasma active glucose-dependent insulinotropic peptide (GIP). In conclusions, canagliflozin-administration before meals decreased PG and serum insulin, and increased plasma active GLP-1 levels in patients with type 2 diabetes.

        "Abstract":"The sodium-dependent glucose transporter 2 (SGLT2) inhibitors are an important emerging class for the treatment of diabetes. Development of SGLT2 inhibitors has been oriented around a desire for high selectivity for the SGLT2 protein relative to the SGLT1 protein. More recently, genetic and pharmacology research in mice has indicated that gastrointestinal SGLT1 inhibition may also be an appropriate therapeutic target to treat diabetes. Combining SGLT1 and SGLT2 inhibition in a single molecule would provide complementary insulin-independent mechanisms to treat diabetes. Therefore, sotagliflozin (LX4211) has been developed as a dual inhibitor of SGLT1 and SGLT2. The differentiating clinical features of dual inhibitor of SGLT1 and SGLT2 include a large postprandial glucose reduction, elevation of glucagon-like peptide 1 and modest urinary glucose excretion. These features may have clinical implications for the use of sotagliflozin in the treatment of both type 1 and type 2 diabetes.",

        "Abstract":"INTRODUCTION: The PIONEER trial programme showed that, after 52 weeks, the novel oral glucagon-like peptide-1 (GLP-1) analogue semaglutide 14 mg was associated with significantly greater reductions in glycated haemoglobin (HbA1c) versus a sodium-glucose cotransporter-2 inhibitor (empagliflozin 25 mg), a dipeptidyl peptidase-4 inhibitor (sitagliptin 100 mg) and an injectable GLP-1 analogue (liraglutide 1.8 mg). The aim of the present analysis was to assess the long-term cost-effectiveness of oral semaglutide 14 mg versus each of these comparators in the UK setting.\nMETHODS: Analyses were performed from a healthcare payer perspective using the IQVIA CORE Diabetes Model, in which outcomes were projected over patient lifetimes (50 years). Baseline cohort characteristics and treatment effects were based on 52-week data from the PIONEER 2, 3 and 4 randomised controlled trials, comparing oral semaglutide with empagliflozin, sitagliptin and liraglutide, respectively. Treatment switching occurred when HbA1c exceeded 7.5% (58 mmol\/mol). Utilities, treatment costs and costs of diabetes-related complications (in pounds sterling [GBP]) were taken from published sources. The acquisition cost of oral semaglutide was assumed to match that of once-weekly semaglutide.\nRESULTS: Oral semaglutide was associated with improvements in quality-adjusted life expectancy of 0.09 quality-adjusted life years (QALYs) versus empagliflozin, 0.20 QALYs versus sitagliptin and 0.07 QALYs versus liraglutide. Direct costs over a patient's lifetime were GBP 971 and GBP 963 higher with oral semaglutide than with empagliflozin and sitagliptin, respectively, but GBP 1551 lower versus liraglutide. Oral semaglutide was associated with a reduced incidence of diabetes-related complications versus all comparators. Therefore, oral semaglutide 14 mg was associated with incremental cost-effectiveness ratios of GBP 11,006 and 4930 per QALY gained versus empagliflozin 25 mg and sitagliptin 100 mg, respectively, and was more effective and less costly (dominant) versus liraglutide 1.8 mg.\nCONCLUSION: Oral semaglutide was cost-effective versus empagliflozin and sitagliptin, and dominant versus liraglutide, for the treatment of type 2 diabetes in the UK.",

        "Abstract":"The growing amount of evidence suggests the existence of a bidirectional relation between coronavirus disease 2019 (COVID-19) and type 2 diabetes mellitus (T2DM), as these two conditions exacerbate each other, causing a significant healthcare and socioeconomic burden. The alterations in innate and adaptive cellular immunity, adipose tissue, alveolar and endothelial dysfunction, hypercoagulation, the propensity to an increased viral load, and chronic diabetic complications are all associated with glucometabolic perturbations of T2DM patients that predispose them to severe forms of COVID-19 and mortality. Severe acute respiratory syndrome coronavirus 2 infection negatively impacts glucose homeostasis due to its effects on insulin sensitivity and β-cell function, further aggravating the preexisting glucometabolic perturbations in individuals with T2DM. Thus, the most effective ways are urgently needed for countering these glucometabolic disturbances occurring during acute COVID-19 illness in T2DM patients. The novel classes of antidiabetic medications (dipeptidyl peptidase 4 inhibitors (DPP-4is), glucagon-like peptide-1 receptor agonists (GLP-1 RAs), and sodium-glucose co-transporter-2 inhibitors (SGLT-2is) are considered candidate drugs for this purpose. This review article summarizes current knowledge regarding glucometabolic disturbances during acute COVID-19 illness in T2DM patients and the potential ways to tackle them using novel antidiabetic medications. Recent observational data suggest that preadmission use of GLP-1 RAs and SGLT-2is are associated with decreased patient mortality, while DPP-4is is associated with increased in-hospital mortality of T2DM patients with COVID-19. Although these results provide further evidence for the widespread use of these two classes of medications in this COVID-19 era, dedicated randomized controlled trials analyzing the effects of in-hospital use of novel antidiabetic agents in T2DM patients with COVID-19 are needed.",

The effect size was expressed as the mean difference (MD) or standardized mean difference (SMD) and its 95% confidence interval (CI). Subgroup analyses were performed based on the stage A-B or stage C HF population and HF types.\nRESULTS: Compared to placebo or other antidiabetic drugs, SGLT2i showed no significant effects on left ventricular mass index, left ventricular end diastolic volume index, left ventricular end systolic volume index, or left atrial volume index. SGLT2i improved left ventricular ejection fraction only in the subgroup of HF patients with reduced ejection fraction (MD 3.16%, 95% CI 0.11 to 6.22, p = 0.04; I = 0%), and did not affect the global longitudinal strain in the overall analysis including stage A-B HF patients.

        "Abstract":"The fasting in the holy month of Ramadan is passionately practised among the Muslims population around the world. Patients with diabetes are generally considered to have various risks with fasting. The recent pharmacologic and technical advances in the management of diabetes may have enabled these patients to practice safe fasting. The purpose of this review is to scientific evidence on the safety and efficacy of the current hypoglycemic agents during Ramadan. METHODS: An extensive Electronic search via PubMed and Google scholar was accomplished through using different search terms. The eligible studies were limited to only published Randomised controlled trial (RCT) and prospective observational studies from 2007 to 2018 on patients with all types of diabetes on any pharmacological management, who intended to fast in Ramadan. RESULTS AND CONCLUSIONS: The current era witnessed a gradual shift in the management of these patients with diabetes who elected to fast in Ramadan, despite the variable health-related risks with fasting. Results from available RCTs and observational studies in patients with type 2 diabetes showed lower risk of hypoglycemia, similar or better efficacy for glycemic and weight control with SGLT2 inhibitors, incretin mimetics and the newer insulin analogues compared to Sulfonylurea. Gliclazide is a relatively safer option among all sulfonylurea. Patients requiring insulin did better with insulin analogues, especially the newer premixed formulation at the time of breaking fast compared to the former insulin formulation. Current commonly used newer hypoglycemic agents are generally safe during Ramadan, however, their safety in the higher risk diabetes patients is highly needed.",

        "Abstract":"PURPOSE: DJT1116PG, which selectively inhibits renal glucose reabsorption by inhibiting sodium-glucose cotransporter type 2, was developed as an insulin-independent treatment for type 2 diabetes mellitus. This Phase I trial evaluated the pharmacokinetic and pharmacodynamic properties of DJT1116PG at steady state in healthy Chinese individuals.\nMETHODS: This was a multiple ascending dose study of DJT1116PG (20, 50, and 100 mg once daily for 7 days) that included 36 healthy individuals.\nFINDINGS: There were no serious adverse events or deaths in these studies, and no adverse event led to study discontinuation. Oral DJT1116PG was rapidly absorbed with a T of 0.75-1.5 h and a t of 12-16.2 h. Systemic exposure (C and AUC) of DJT1116PG and its inactive metabolites (T1444, T1454, and T1830) increased in a dose-dependent manner. Urinary glucose excretion (UGE) plateaued at 50 mg of DJT1116PG in a previous single ascending dose study and on day 1 of this study. UGE plateaued at 20 mg of DJT1116PG on day 7 of this study. Serum glucose parameters were similar in individuals who received DJT1116PG or placebo.\nIMPLICATIONS: DJT1116PG was well tolerated in healthy Chinese individuals. At steady state, UGE plateaued at 20 mg of DJT1116PG in these individuals. These findings will inform the selection of doses for further early-stage clinical trials of DJT1116PG.

        "Abstract":"Empagliflozin is a new inhibitor of sodiumglucose cotransporters type 2 (SGLT2) for the treatment of type 2 diabetes mellitus (T2DM). Its specific action inhibits glucose reabsorption in renal tubules and thus promotes glucosuria. This effect results in a reduction in fasting and postprandial glycaemia and a decrease of glycated haemoglobin (HbA(Ic)), independently of insulin. Furthermore, calorie urinary loss promotes weight reduction and osmotic diuresis lowers arterial blood pressure. The efficacy of empagliflozin increases according to the level of hyperglycaemia but decreases in patients with renal insufficiency. In 24 to 104-week controlled trials versus placebo, empagliflozin reduces HbA(1c) (approximately 0.8%), without hypoglycaemia (except in patients already treated with insulin or sulphonylureas). This improvement in glucose control is rather similar to that observed with active comparators (metformin, glimepiride or sitagliptin), with the advantage for empagliflozin of reducing body weight (approximately 2 kg) and blood pressure (systolic approximately 4 mm Hg and diastolic approximately 2 mm Hg). Empagliflozin has shown a cardiovascular protection in the EMPA-REG OUTCOME trial. Mycotic genital infections occur more frequently, especially in women, while a negligible increase in mild urinary tract infections may be observed. The risk of hypotension and volume depletion is low, although it should be carefully checked in more fragile and at risk patients. Empagliflozin (Jardiance), which is commercialized at the doses of 10 mg and 25 mg once daily, is indicated for the treatment of T2DM and reimbursed in Belgium with conditions as add-on to a background glucose-lowering therapy.",

        "Abstract":"BACKGROUND: Empagliflozin, a sodium-glucose cotransporter 2 inhibitor, reduced cardiovascular morbidity and mortality in patients with type 2 diabetes mellitus and established cardiovascular disease in the EMPA-REG OUTCOME trial (Empagliflozin Cardiovascular Outcome Event Trial in Type 2 Diabetes Mellitus Patients). Urinary glucose excretion with empagliflozin decreases with declining renal function, resulting in less potency for glucose lowering in patients with kidney disease. We investigated the effects of empagliflozin on clinical outcomes in patients with type 2 diabetes mellitus, established cardiovascular disease, and chronic kidney disease.\nMETHODS: Patients with type 2 diabetes mellitus, established cardiovascular disease, and estimated glomerular filtration rate (eGFR) ≥30 mL·min·1.73 m at screening were randomized to receive empagliflozin 10 mg, empagliflozin 25 mg, or placebo once daily in addition to standard of care. We analyzed cardiovascular death, hospitalization for heart failure, all-cause hospitalization, and all-cause mortality in patients with prevalent kidney disease (defined as eGFR <60 mL·min·1.73 m and\/or urine albumin-creatinine ratio >300 mg\/g) at baseline. Additional analyses were performed in subgroups by baseline eGFR (<45, 45-<60, 60-<90, ≥90 mL·min·1.73 m) and baseline urine albumin-creatinine ratio (>300, 30-≤300, <30 mg\/g).\nRESULTS: Of 7020 patients treated, 2250 patients had prevalent kidney disease at baseline, of whom 67% had a diagnosis of type 2 diabetes mellitus for >10 years, 58% were receiving insulin, and 84% were taking angiotensin-converting enzyme inhibitors or angiotensin receptor blockers. In patients with prevalent kidney disease at baseline, empagliflozin reduced the risk of cardiovascular death by 29% compared with placebo (hazard ratio [HR], 0.71; 95% confidence interval [CI], 0.52-0.98), the risk of all-cause mortality by 24% (HR, 0.76; 95% CI, 0.59-0.99), the risk of hospitalization for heart failure by 39% (HR, 0.61; 95% CI, 0.42-0.87), and the risk of all-cause hospitalization by 19% (HR, 0.81; 95% CI, 0.72-0.92). Effects of empagliflozin on these outcomes were consistent across categories of eGFR and urine albumin-creatinine ratio at baseline and across the 2 doses studied. The adverse event profile of empagliflozin in patients with eGFR <60 mL·min·1.73 m was consistent with the overall trial population.\nCONCLUSIONS: Empagliflozin improved clinical outcomes and reduced mortality in vulnerable patients with type 2 diabetes mellitus, established cardiovascular disease, and chronic kidney disease.\nCLINICAL TRIAL REGISTRATION: URL: https:\/\/www.clinicaltrials.gov.

        "Published":"2018-05-25",
        "Abstract":"INTRODUCTION: Empagliflozin is an SGLT-2 inhibitor (SGLT-2i) which belongs to a new class of hypoglycemic drugs with the unique property of decreasing blood glucose independently from insulin, through an increase in glycosuria. In addition to decreasing cardiovascular morbidity and mortality, empagliflozin has nephroprotective properties in high cardiovascular risk patients with type 2 diabetes. Decreased hyperfiltration and shifting towards more favorable renal fuel energetics with improved renal oxygenation may explain some of these properties. With this study, we propose to explore the effects of empagliflozin on renal tissue oxygenation using blood oxygenation level-dependent magnetic resonance imaging (BOLD-MRI).\nMETHODS: This is a double-blind, randomized, placebo-controlled study examining the acute and chronic renal effects of empagliflozin 10 mg. The primary outcome is the effects of empagliflozin on renal tissue oxygenation as measured by BOLD-MRI. The secondary outcomes include the effects of empagliflozin on tubular function, 24 h blood pressure control, and the influence of body mass index (BMI) on the renal response to empagliflozin. Fifteen normal weight, 15 overweight, and 15 obese non-diabetic subjects (men and women) will be recruited. Each participant will undergo 24 h urine collections and blood pressure measurements on day - 1, followed by an investigation day at the study center with blood and urine sampling and renal BOLD-MRI measurements before and 180 min after the administration of 10 mg empagliflozin or placebo. This sequence of measurements will be repeated after 1 month of a daily empagliflozin or placebo intake. To investigate renal oxygenation, the renal cortical and medullary R2*, as a marker of oxygenation, will be assessed by BOLD-MRI under standardized hydration conditions: the higher R2*, the lower oxygenation.\nCONCLUSION: SGLT-2 inhibitors have a profound effect on renal physiology. This is an important study that will explore for the first time whether inhibiting SGLT-2 with empagliflozin in healthy volunteers affects renal tissue oxygenation as determined by BOLD-MRI.\nFUNDING: Boehringer Ingelheim Pharma GmbH & Co.\nTRIAL REGISTRATION: ClinicalTrials.gov identifier, NCT03093103.",

        "Abstract":"PURPOSE: Sodium-glucose cotransporter-2 (SGLT2) inhibitor empagliflozin has recently been shown to improve the outcomes of heart failure (HF) patients regardless of patient's left ventricular ejection fraction by reducing the combined risk of cardiovascular death or hospitalization for worsening HF. The aim of this study was to assess the cost-effectiveness of adding empagliflozin to the standard care (SC) in comparison to SC only in the treatment of HF in Finland.\nPATIENTS AND METHODS: The assessment was performed in the cost-utility framework using two Markov cohort state-transition models, one for HF with reduced ejection fraction (HFrEF) and one for HF with preserved ejection fraction (HFpEF). The models have been primarily developed based on the EMPEROR-Reduced and EMPEROR-Preserved trials which informed the modelled patient characteristics, efficacy of treatments in terms of associated risks for heart failure hospitalizations, cardiovascular (CV) and non-CV death, treatment related adverse events (AE), and state- and event-specific health-related quality of life weights (EQ-5D). Direct health care costs were estimated from Finnish published references. Cost-effectiveness was assessed from health care payer perspective based on incremental cost-effectiveness ratio (ICER; cost per quality adjusted life-year [QALY] gained) and probability of cost-effectiveness (at willingness-to-pay [WTP] of 35,000 euros\/QALY). The ICER was reported as the weighted (HFrEF, 43.5%; HFpEF, 56.5%) average result of the two models.\nRESULTS: Empagliflozin + SC treatment increased the average quality-adjusted life-expectancy, and treatment costs of HF patients by 0.15 QALYs and 1,594 euros, respectively, when compared to SC. An additional QALY with empagliflozin was thus gained at a cost of 10,621 euros. The probability of empagliflozin + SC being cost-effective compared to placebo + SC was 77.6% and 83.5% with WTP of 35,000 and 100,000 euros\/QALY, respectively.\nCONCLUSION: Empagliflozin is a cost-effective treatment for patients with HF in the Finnish health care setting.",

        "Abstract":"BACKGROUND: Diabetes is a leading cause of chronic kidney disease (CKD) worldwide. Optimum glycaemic control in patients with type 2 diabetes is important to minimise the risk of microvascular and macrovascular complications and to slow the progression of CKD. We assessed the efficacy and safety of empagliflozin as an add-on treatment in patients with type 2 diabetes and CKD.\nMETHODS: We did a phase 3, randomised, double-blind, parallel-group, placebo-controlled trial at 127 centres in 15 countries. Patients with HbA1c of 7% or greater to 10% or less were eligible for inclusion. Patients with stage 2 CKD (estimated glomerular filtration rate [eGFR] ≥60 to <90 mL\/min per 1·73 m(2); n=290) were randomly assigned (1:1:1) to receive empagliflozin 10 mg or 25 mg or placebo once daily for 52 weeks. Patients with stage 3 CKD (eGFR ≥30 to <60 mL\/min per 1·73 m(2); n=374) were randomly assigned (1:1) to receive empagliflozin 25 mg or placebo for 52 weeks. Randomisation was done with a computer-generated random sequence and stratified by renal impairment, HbA1c, and background antidiabetes medication. Treatment assignment was masked from patients and investigators. The primary endpoint was change from baseline in HbA1c at week 24 by ANCOVA in the full analysis set. This study is registered with ClinicalTrials.gov, number NCT01164501.\nFINDINGS: In patients with stage 2 CKD, adjusted mean treatment differences versus placebo in changes from baseline in HbA1c at week 24 were -0·52% (95% CI -0·72 to -0·32) for empagliflozin 10 mg and -0·68% (-0·88 to -0·49) for empagliflozin 25 mg (both p<0·0001). In patients with stage 3 CKD, adjusted mean treatment difference versus placebo in change from baseline in HbA1c at week 24 was -0·42% (-0·56 to -0·28) for empagliflozin 25 mg (p<0·0001). In patients with stage 2 CKD, adverse events were reported over 52 weeks by 83 patients (87%) on placebo (15 severe [16%] and 11 serious [12%]), 86 (88%) on empagliflozin 10 mg (six severe [6%] and six serious [6%]) and 78 (80%) on empagliflozin 25 mg (eight severe [8%] and seven serious [7%]).

Type 2 diabetes mellitus (T2DM) patients are at an increased risk of incident HF even in the absence of cardiovascular risk factors. Patients with established HF are at an increased risk of death following a worsening HF event. Various trials on sodium-glucose cotransporter-2 (SGLT2) inhibitors have shown that these novel drugs prevent incident HF and reduce the risk of worsening HF in both patients with T2DM and those without diabetes. This literature review analyzed the data from 13 randomized controlled trials that met the pre-specified inclusion criteria. The aim was to compare the clinical outcomes of SGLT2 inhibitors for primary and secondary prevention of HF in patients with T2DM and those without diabetes. In addition, this study collated and summarized the patients' clinical characteristics with respect to the clinical outcome, and finally, it evaluated the safety considerations when using SGLT2 inhibitors. The data showed that SGLT2 inhibitors are effective and safe in the primary and secondary prevention of HF across a broad spectrum of patient populations and care settings.

Using the trial results, we created a discrete-event simulation model to assess lifetime health economic outcomes in people with Type 2 diabetes and established cardiovascular disease.\nMETHODS: Time-dependent survival regression analysis was performed on data from EMPA-REG OUTCOME for 10 cardiovascular and renal events (e.g. stroke, heart failure hospitalization, macroalbuminuria, cardiovascular mortality) to capture event rates over time, and interaction between events. Model performance was assessed by comparing predicted and observed outcomes at 3 years. Costs in the United Kingdom (UK) and health utilities were obtained from published literature. Outcomes included cumulative event rates, life-years, costs and quality-adjusted life-years (QALYs).\nRESULTS: The model predicted an 18% relative increase (by 2.1 life-years) in survival for empagliflozin (14.0 life-years) vs. standard of care (11.9 life-years), attributable to direct treatment effect on cardiovascular mortality, and to indirect effect via reductions in other events. Participants treated with empagliflozin may experience improved quality of life (1.0 QALY) and higher costs (£3737\/participant), yielding an incremental cost-effectiveness ratio (ICER) of £4083\/QALY. Sensitivity analyses confirmed the robustness of these results to changes in input parameters.\nCONCLUSIONS: Based on extrapolation of EMPA-REG OUTCOME trial data using a participant-level simulation model, empagliflozin in addition to standard of care is projected to be highly cost-effective using UK healthcare costs. The impact in other countries will vary due to differences in drug pricing and accrual of other costs. (Clinical Trial Registry No: NCT01131676).",

EMPULSE is designed to assess the clinical benefit and safety of the SGLT2 inhibitor empagliflozin compared with placebo in patients hospitalized with AHF.\nMETHODS: EMPULSE is a randomized, double-blind, parallel-group, placebo-controlled multinational trial comparing the in-hospital initiation of empagliflozin (10 mg once daily) with placebo. Approximately 500 patients admitted for AHF with dyspnoea, signs of fluid overload, and elevated natriuretic peptides will be randomized 1:1 stratified to HF status (de-novo and decompensated chronic HF) to either empagliflozin or placebo at approximately 165 sites across North America, Europe and Asia. Patients will be enrolled regardless of ejection fraction and diabetes status and will be randomized during hospitalization and after stabilization (between 24 h and 5 days after admission), with treatment continued up to 90 days after initiation. The primary outcome is clinical benefit at 90 days, consisting of a composite of all-cause death, HF events, and ≥5 point change from baseline in Kansas City Cardiomyopathy Questionnaire total symptom score (KCCQ-TSS), assessed using a 'win-ratio' approach. Secondary outcomes include assessments of safety, change in KCCQ-TSS from baseline to 90 days and change in natriuretic peptides from baseline to 30 days.\nCONCLUSION: The EMPULSE trial will evaluate the clinical benefit and safety of empagliflozin in patients hospitalized for AHF.",

In this study, we explored the impact of the average weight loss amount demonstrated with canagliflozin treatment on improvement in 3 patient-relevant outcomes that have been linked to performance of healthy behaviors and better outcomes in T2DM: weight-related quality of life, as measured by the Impact of Weight on Quality of Life-Lite (IWQOL-Lite) questionnaire, and satisfaction with physical health and emotional health, as measured by the Current Health Satisfaction Questionnaire (CHES-Q), using data from a previously reported study. Weight loss of an amount demonstrated in clinical trials of canagliflozin was associated with improvements in weight-related quality of life and satisfaction with physical and emotional health, concepts shown to be important to the persistent and consistent performance of healthy behaviors.",

        "Abstract":"In view of the significant cardiovascular (CV) morbidity and mortality in patients with type 2 diabetes mellitus, and concerns raised about the CV safety of some glucose-lowering drugs, the US Food and Drug Administration (FDA) issued guidance for the industry in 2008 to demonstrate CV safety for the approval of all new antihyperglycemic drugs. Seven randomized controlled trials involving around 60,000 participants have been completed so far and have demonstrated the CV safety of dipeptidyl peptidase 4 inhibitors (saxagliptin, alogliptin and sitagliptin), glucagon-like peptide-1 receptor agonists (lixisenatide, liraglutide and semaglutide) and a sodium-glucose co-transporter 2 inhibitor (empagliflozin) in patients with type 2 diabetes. Three of these trials have in fact reported superiority of the study drug over placebo in terms of CV outcomes. However, all these trials were primarily designed as non-inferiority trials to exclude an unacceptable risk of CV events with these drugs in the shortest possible time period. The potential long-term benefit or risks were not assessed effectively as the median follow-up in these studies was limited to 1.5-3 years. Also, these trials included patients with relatively long duration of diabetes, advanced atherosclerosis and higher CV risk. Thus, these trials were not intended to assess CV benefit and are best interpreted as evidence for CV safety of these antihyperglycemic medications.",

The primary endpoint was change from baseline in NT-proBNP after 12 weeks. Secondary endpoints included change from baseline in glycated haemoglobin, fasting plasma glucose, weight, blood pressure, fasting lipid profile, high-sensitivity c-reactive protein, and safety and tolerability.\nRESULTS: Licogliflozin 10 mg for 12 weeks significantly reduced NT-proBNP vs placebo (Geometric mean ratio 0.56 [95% confidence interval: 0.33, 0.95], P = .033). A trend was observed with 50 mg licogliflozin (0.64 [95% confidence interval: 0.40, 1.03], P = .064), with no difference between licogliflozin and empagliflozin. The largest numerical decreases in glycated haemoglobin were with licogliflozin 50 mg (-0.58 ± 0.34%) and empagliflozin (-0.44 ± 1.18%) vs placebo (-0.04 ± 0.91%). The reduction in body weight was similar with licogliflozin 50 mg (-2.15 ± 2.40 kg) and empagliflozin (-2.25 ± 1.89 kg). A numerical reduction in systolic blood pressure was seen with licogliflozin 50 mg (-9.54 ± 16.88 mmHg) and empagliflozin (-6.98 ± 15.03 mmHg) vs placebo (-2.85 ± 11.97 mmHg). Adverse events (AEs) were mild, including hypotension (6.5%), hypoglycaemia (8.1%) and inadequate diabetes control (1.6%).

        "Abstract":"2\nBackground The DAPA-CKD (Dapagliflozin and Prevention of Adverse Outcomes in Chronic Kidney Disease) trial (NCT03036150) demonstrated that dapagliflozin reduced the risk of kidney and cardiovascular events in patients with chronic kidney disease and albuminuria with and without type 2 diabetes. We aimed to determine whether baseline cardiovascular medication use modified the dapagliflozin treatment effect. Methods and Results We randomized 4304 adults with baseline estimated glomerular filtration rate 25 to 75 mL\/min per 1.73 m and urinary albumin:creatinine ratio 200 to 5000 mg\/g to dapagliflozin 10 mg or placebo once daily. The primary end point was a composite of ≥50% estimated glomerular filtration rate decline, end-stage kidney disease, and kidney or cardiovascular death. Secondary end points included a kidney composite end point (primary composite end point without cardiovascular death), a cardiovascular composite end point (hospitalized heart failure or cardiovascular death), and all-cause mortality. We categorized patients according to baseline cardiovascular medication use\/nonuse. Patients were required by protocol to receive a stable (and maximally tolerated) dose of a renin-angiotensin-aldosterone system inhibitor. We observed consistent benefits of dapagliflozin relative to placebo, irrespective of baseline use\/nonuse of renin-angiotensin-aldosterone system inhibitors (98.1%), calcium channel blockers (50.7%), β-adrenergic antagonists (39.0%), diuretics (43.7%), and antithrombotic (47.4%), and lipid-lowering (15.0%) agents. Use of these drugs in combination with dapagliflozin did not increase the number of serious adverse events. Conclusions The safety profile and efficacy of dapagliflozin on kidney and cardiovascular end points in patients with chronic kidney disease were consistent among patients treated and not treated at baseline with a range of cardiovascular medications.

        "Abstract":"Diabetic kidney disease (DKD) develops in almost half of all patients with diabetes and is the most common cause of chronic kidney disease (CKD) worldwide. Despite the high risk of chronic renal failure in these patients, only few therapeutic strategies are available. The use of renin-angiotensin system blockers to reduce the incidence of kidney failure in patients with DKD was established years ago and remains the hallmark of therapy. The past 2 years have seen a dramatic change in our therapeutic arsenal for CKD. Sodium-glucose co-transporter‑2 inhibitors (SGLT2s) have been successfully introduced for the treatment of CKD. A further addition is a novel compound antagonizing the activation of the mineralocorticoid receptor: finerenone. Finerenone reduces albuminuria and surrogate markers of cardiovascular disease in patients who are already on optimal therapy. In the past, treatment with other mineralocorticoid receptor antagonists was hampered by a significantly increased risk of hyperkalemia. Finerenone had a much smaller effect on hyperkalemia. Together with a reduced effect on blood pressure and no signs of gynecomastia, this therapeutic strategy had a more specific anti-inflammatory effect and a smaller effect on the volume\/electrolyte axis. In the FIDELIO-DKD study comparing the actions of the non-steroidal mineralocorticoid receptor antagonist finerenone with placebo, finerenone reduced the progression of DKD and the incidence of cardiovascular events, with a relatively safe adverse event profile. In this article, we summarize the available evidence on the cardioprotective and nephroprotective effects of finerenone and analyze the molecular mechanisms involved. In addition, we discuss the potential future role of mineralocorticoid receptor inhibition in the treatment of patients with diabetic CKD.",

We aim to study the effect of empagliflozin on cardiovascular and kidney outcomes across the spectrum of kidney function.\nMETHODS: In this prespecified analysis, patients were categorized by the presence or absence of chronic kidney disease (CKD) at baseline (estimated glomerular filtration rate [eGFR] <60 ml\/min\/1.73 m or albumin-to-creatine ratio >300 mg\/g). The primary and key secondary outcomes were: (1) a composite of cardiovascular death or HF hospitalization (primary outcome); (2) total HF hospitalizations; and (3) eGFR slope. The direct impact on kidney events was investigated by a prespecified composite kidney outcome (defined as a sustained profound decline in eGFR, chronic dialysis, or transplant). The median follow-up was 16 months.\nRESULTS: Of 3730 patients who were randomized to empagliflozin or placebo, 1978 (53%) had CKD. Empagliflozin reduced the primary outcome and total HF hospitalizations in patients with and without CKD: hazard ratio (HR)=0.78 (95% CI, 0.65-0.93) and HR=0.72 (95% CI, 0.58-0.90), respectively (interaction =0.63). Empagliflozin slowed the slope of eGFR decline by 1.11 (0.23-1.98) ml\/min\/1.73 m\/yr in patients with CKD and by 2.41 (1.49-3.32) ml\/min\/1.73 m\/yr in patients without CKD. The risk of the composite kidney outcome was reduced similarly in patients with and without CKD: HR=0.53 (95% CI, 0.31-0.91) and HR=0.46 (95% CI, 0.22-0.99), respectively. The effect of empagliflozin on the primary composite outcome and key secondary outcomes was consistent across a broad range of baseline kidney function, measured by clinically relevant eGFR subgroups or by albuminuria, including patients with eGFR as low as 20 ml\/min\/1.73 m. Empagliflozin was well tolerated in CKD patients.\nCONCLUSIONS: In EMPEROR-Reduced, empagliflozin had a beneficial effect on the key efficacy outcomes and slowed the rate of kidney function decline in patients with and without CKD, and regardless of the severity of kidney impairment at baseline.

        "Abstract":"INTRODUCTION: Type 2 diabetes mellitus causes a sizable burden globally from both health and economic points of view. This study aimed to assess the budget impact of substituting sitagliptin with liraglutide versus other glucose-lowering drugs from the private health insurance perspective in Egypt over a 3-year time horizon.\nMETHODS: Two budget impact models were compared with the standard of care (metformin, pioglitazone, gliclazide, insulin glargine, repaglinide, and empagliflozin) administered in addition to liraglutide or sitagliptin versus the standard of care with placebo. A gradual market introduction of liraglutide or sitagliptin was assumed, and the existing market shares for the other glucose-lowering drugs were provided and validated by the Expert Panel. The event rates were extracted from the LEADER and TECOS trials. Direct and mortality costs were measured. Sensitivity analyses were performed.\nRESULTS: The estimated target population of 120,574 type 2 diabetic adult patients was associated with cardio vascular risk. The budget impact per patient per month for liraglutide is EGP29 ($6.7), EGP39 ($9), and EGP49 ($11.3) in the 1st, 2nd, and 3rd years, respectively. The budget impact per patient per month for sitagliptin is EGP11 ($2.5), EGP14 ($3.2), and EGP18 ($4.1) in the 1st, 2nd, and 3rd years, respectively. Furthermore, adoption of liraglutide resulted in 203 fewer deaths and 550 avoided hospitalizations, while sitagliptin resulted in 43 increased deaths and 14 avoided hospitalizations. The treatment costs of liraglutide use are mostly offset by substantial savings due to fewer cardiovascular-related events, avoided mortality and avoided hospitalizations over 3 years.\nCONCLUSION: Adding liraglutide resulted in a modest budget impact, suggesting that the upfront drug costs were offset by budget savings due to fewer cardiovascular-related complications and deaths avoided compared to the standard of care. Sitagliptin resulted in a small budget impact but was associated with increased deaths and fewer hospitalizations avoided.",

In cardiovascular trials of inhibitors of sodium-glucose cotransporter 2 (SGLT2), exploratory results have suggested that such drugs may improve renal outcomes in patients with type 2 diabetes.\nMETHODS: In this double-blind, randomized trial, we assigned patients with type 2 diabetes and albuminuric chronic kidney disease to receive canagliflozin, an oral SGLT2 inhibitor, at a dose of 100 mg daily or placebo. All the patients had an estimated glomerular filtration rate (GFR) of 30 to <90 ml per minute per 1.73 m of body-surface area and albuminuria (ratio of albumin [mg] to creatinine [g], >300 to 5000) and were treated with renin-angiotensin system blockade. The primary outcome was a composite of end-stage kidney disease (dialysis, transplantation, or a sustained estimated GFR of <15 ml per minute per 1.73 m), a doubling of the serum creatinine level, or death from renal or cardiovascular causes. Prespecified secondary outcomes were tested hierarchically.\nRESULTS: The trial was stopped early after a planned interim analysis on the recommendation of the data and safety monitoring committee. At that time, 4401 patients had undergone randomization, with a median follow-up of 2.62 years. The relative risk of the primary outcome was 30% lower in the canagliflozin group than in the placebo group, with event rates of 43.2 and 61.2 per 1000 patient-years, respectively (hazard ratio, 0.70; 95% confidence interval [CI], 0.59 to 0.82; P = 0.00001). The relative risk of the renal-specific composite of end-stage kidney disease, a doubling of the creatinine level, or death from renal causes was lower by 34% (hazard ratio, 0.66; 95% CI, 0.53 to 0.81; P<0.001), and the relative risk of end-stage kidney disease was lower by 32% (hazard ratio, 0.68; 95% CI, 0.54 to 0.86; P = 0.002). The canagliflozin group also had a lower risk of cardiovascular death, myocardial infarction, or stroke (hazard ratio, 0.80; 95% CI, 0.67 to 0.95; P = 0.01) and hospitalization for heart failure (hazard ratio, 0.61; 95% CI, 0.47 to 0.80; P<0.001). There were no significant differences in rates of amputation or fracture.\nCONCLUSIONS: In patients with type 2 diabetes and kidney disease, the risk of kidney failure and cardiovascular events was lower in the canagliflozin group than in the placebo group at a median follow-up of 2.62 years.

This study assessed the effect of these drug classes on COVID-19-related outcomes.\nMETHODS: Using a COVID-19 linkable administrative database, we selected patients aged ≥40 years with at least 2 prescriptions of DPP-4i, GLP-1 RA, or SGLT-2i or any other antihyperglycemic drug and a diagnosis of COVID-19 from February 15, 2020, to March 15, 2021. Adjusted odds ratios (ORs) with 95% CIs were used to calculate the association between treatments and all-cause and in-hospital mortality and COVID-19-related hospitalization. A sensitivity analysis was performed by using inverse probability treatment weighting.\nFINDINGS: Overall, 32,853 subjects were included in the analysis. Multivariable models showed a reduction of the risk for COVID-19 outcomes for users of DPP-4i, GLP-1 RA, and SGLT-2i compared with nonusers, although statistical significance was reached only in DPP-4i users for total mortality (OR, 0.89; 95% CI, 0.82-0.97). The sensitivity analysis confirmed the main results reaching a significant reduction for hospital admission in GLP-1 RA users and in-hospital mortality in SGLT-2i users compared with nonusers.\nIMPLICATIONS: This study found a beneficial effect in the risk reduction of COVID-19 total mortality in DPP-4i users compared with nonusers. A positive trend was also observed in users of GLP-1 RA and SGLT-2i compared with nonusers. Randomized clinical trials are needed to confirm the effect of these drug classes as potential therapy for the treatment of COVID-19.",

        "Abstract":"The clinical efficacy of continuous subcutaneous insulin infusion (CSII) therapy combined with six classes of oral glucose-lowering drugs (GLDs) (TZDs\/metformin\/acarbose\/GLP-1 receptor agonist\/SGLT-2 inhibitor\/DPP-4 inhibitor) was evaluated by a network meta-analysis to provide an evidence-based reference in making a clinical decision on CSII combined with drugs in the treatment of type 2 diabetes. Data were retrieved from eight databases: the Chinese Journal Full-Text Database (CNKI), VIP Chinese Science and Technology Periodicals Full-Text Database (VP-CSFD), Wanfang Data Journal Paper Resource (WANFANG), China Biomedical Database (CBM), PubMed, Embase, Cochrane Library, and Web of Science. The retrieval period dated from the library's construction to 27 June 2021. The search was for randomized, controlled trial studies (RCT) on insulin infusion (CSII) combined with oral hypoglycemic drugs (TZDs\/metformin\/acarbose\/GLP-1 receptor agonist\/SGLT-2 inhibitor\/DPP-4 inhibitor) in the treatment of type 2 diabetes. Quality evaluation and data extraction were performed on the studies included, and network meta-analysis was performed with R4.0.1 software. A total of 56 publications was included in the final network meta-analysis, with a total sample size of 4395. Results based on the network meta-analysis were that CSII combined with a metformin works best on fasting blood glucose (FBG) and 2 h postprandial blood glucose (2hPG) and improves insulin resistance (lower HOMA-IR levels). CSII combined with a DPP-4 inhibitor had the best clinical effect in reducing glycosylated hemoglobin levels. Treatment with CSII combined with a DPP-4 inhibitor was the fastest way to achieve the blood glucose standard. In terms of insulin dosage, an insulin pump (CSII) combined with the GLP-1 receptor agonist can significantly reduce insulin dosage. Network meta-analysis evidence suggests that an insulin infusion (CSII) combined with oral hypoglycemic drugs can improve clinical efficacy in controlling blood sugar and improving insulin resistance, insulin dosage, and standard time. However, the most outstanding performance was that of insulin infusion (CSII) combined with metformin, which had the best clinical effect in controlling blood sugar and improving insulin resistance.",

        "Published":"2017-05-18",
        "Abstract":"BACKGROUND: Sodium-glucose cotransporter 2 (SGLT2) inhibitors are a novel class of antihyperglycemic agents that improve glycemic control by increasing glycosuria. Additional benefits beyond glucose lowering include significant improvements in seated clinic blood pressure (BP), partly attributed to their diuretic-like actions. Less known are the effects of this class on 24-hour ambulatory BP, which is a better predictor of cardiovascular risk than seated clinic BP.\nMETHODS AND RESULTS: We performed a meta-analysis of randomized, double-blind, placebo-controlled trials to investigate the effects of SGLT2 inhibitors on 24-hour ambulatory BP. We searched all studies published before August 17, 2016, which reported 24-hour ambulatory BP data. Mean differences in 24-hour BP, daytime BP, and nighttime BP were calculated by a random-effects model. SGLT2 inhibitors significantly reduce 24-hour ambulatory systolic and diastolic BP by -3.76 mm Hg (95% CI, -4.23 to -2.34; I=0.99) and -1.83 mm Hg (95% CI, -2.35 to -1.31; I=0.76), respectively. Significant reductions in daytime and nighttime systolic and diastolic BP were also found. No association between baseline BP or change in body weight were observed.\nCONCLUSIONS: This meta-analysis shows that the reduction in 24-hour ambulatory BP observed with SGLT2 inhibitors is a class effect. The diurnal effect of SGLT2 inhibitors on 24-hour ambulatory BP may contribute to their favorable effects on cardiovascular outcomes.",

        "Abstract":"AIMS: In the Empagliflozin, Cardiovascular Outcomes, and Mortality in Type 2 Diabetes (EMPA-REG) trial, empagliflozin reduced cardiovascular and all-cause mortality in type 2 diabetes (T2D) patients at high cardiovascular risk. We sought to estimate the cost-effectiveness of empagliflozin versus standard treatment for the prevention of cardiovascular morbidity and mortality in patients with T2D.\nMETHODS: A Markov model was developed to assess the cost-effectiveness of empagliflozin (versus standard treatment) for the prevention of cardiovascular morbidity and mortality in patients with T2D using a 3-month cycle length and a lifetime horizon. Data sources included the EMPA-REG randomized clinical trial and other published epidemiological studies. Outcomes included treatment costs (in 2016 US$), quality-adjusted life-years (QALYs) and incremental cost-effectiveness ratios (ICERs). Probabilistic sensitivity analysis (PSA) was performed to test the robustness of conclusions.\nRESULTS: Empagliflozin use resulted in higher total lifetime treatment costs ($371,450 versus $272,966) but yielded greater QALYs (10.712 vs. 9.419) compared to standard treatment. This corresponded to an ICER of $76,167 per QALY gained. PSA suggested empagliflozin would be cost-effective in 96% of 10,000 iterations assuming a willingness-to-pay threshold of $100,000 per QALY gained.\nCONCLUSION: Empagliflozin may be cost-effective compared to standard treatment in T2D patients at high cardiovascular risk.",

        "Abstract":"BACKGROUND: Recent trials demonstrated the clinical efficacy of sodium-glucose cotransporter-2 inhibitors (SGLT2i) in patients with heart failure (HF), regardless of the presence or absence of type 2 diabetes. These data may allow the use of this innovative drug class in clinical routine for treating these patients.\nSTUDY QUESTION: We aimed at further clarifying the role of SGLT2i in patients with diagnosis of HF, capitalizing on pooled sample size and heightened power for clinically relevant safety and efficacy outcomes.\nDATA SOURCES: We conducted a systematic search of PubMed, reference lists of relevant articles, and Medline database from inception until March 1, 2021.\nSTUDY DESIGN: This meta-analysis was completed according to Preferred Reporting Items for Systematic Reviews and Meta-Analyses (PRISMA) guidelines. We searched for randomized trials that evaluated the cardiovascular effects of SGLT2i in patients with HF. Three investigators independently assessed study eligibility, extracted the data, and assessed risk of bias. Hazard ratios and 95% confidence intervals (CIs) were pooled and meta-analyzed using a random-effect model. Numbers needed to treat (NNT) with the relative 95% CIs were also calculated. The primary outcome was a composite of HF hospitalization or an urgent visit for worsening HF and cardiovascular death.\nRESULTS: Three trials were included in the study. Overall, treatment with SGLT2i was associated with a lower risk of the primary composite outcome [hazard ratios 0.73, 95% CI (0.67-0.80), NNT = 11.3]. Similarly, there was a significantly reduced risk of cardiovascular death, all-cause death, HF hospitalization and need for urgent treatment for HF, and HF hospitalization.\nCONCLUSIONS: Therefore, the available evidence supports the routine use of these drugs as standard-of-care, also given the highly favorable NNTs.",

        "Abstract":"PURPOSE: Heart failure is a serious complication after acute myocardial infarction (AMI). It is crucial to investigate the mechanism of action of empagliflozin in the treatment of heart failure.\nMETHODS: A total of 20 wild type (WT) male C57BL6\/J mice were used to establish a model of heart failure after myocardial infarction and randomly divided into 2 groups: treatment group and control group. The treatment group was treated with empagliflozin, and the control group was treated with placebo. After 8 weeks of treatment, mouse heart tissues were collected for next generation sequencing. Bioinformatics methods were used to screen the key genes. Finally, the correlation between clinical data and gene expression was analyzed. Quantitative real-time polymerase chain reaction (qRT-PCR) was used to verify the expression of key genes.\nRESULTS: A mouse model of heart failure was successfully constructed. By DEG analysis, a total of 740 DEGs in the treatment group vs the control group were obtained. Dendritic cells, granulocytes, follicular B, plasma cell, cDC1, cDC2, pDC and neutrophils were 8 different immune cells identified by immunoinfiltration analysis. Through WGCNA, the turquoise module with the highest correlation with the above differential immune cells was selected. One hundred and forty-two immune-related DEGs were obtained by taking intersection of the DEGs and the genes of the turquoise module. Col17a1 and Gria4 were finally screened out as key immune-related genes via PPI analysis and machine learning. Col17a1 was significantly up-regulated, while Gria4 was significantly down-regulated in the treatment group. At the same time, the expression level of Col17a1 was significantly correlated with left ventricular ejection fraction (LVEF), left ventricular fraction shortening (LVFS) and left ventricular internal dimension systole (LVIDs).\nCONCLUSION: Col17a1 and Gria4 are key immune-related genes of empagliflozin in the treatment of heart failure after myocardial infarction. This study provides a scientific basis for elucidating the mechanism of action of empagliflozin in treating heart failure after myocardial infarction.",

        "Abstract":"BACKGROUND: Patients with type 2 diabetes (T2D) and metabolic syndrome (MetS) are at greater cardiovascular risk than those with T2D without MetS. In the current report we aim to study the characteristics, cardio-renal outcomes and the effect of empagliflozin in patients with MetS enrolled in the EMPA-REG OUTCOME trial.\nMETHODS: A total of 7020 patients with T2D and atherosclerotic cardiovascular disease were treated with empagliflozin (10 mg or 25 mg) or placebo for a median of 3.1 years. The World Health Organization MetS criteria could be determined for 6985 (99.5%) patients. We assessed the association between baseline MetS and multiple cardio-renal endpoints using Cox regression models, and we studied the change in the individual component over time of the MetS using mixed effect models.\nRESULTS: MetS at baseline was present in 5740 (82%) patients; these were more often white and had more often albuminuria and heart failure, had lower eGFR and HDL-cholesterol, and higher blood pressure, body mass index, waist circumference, and triglycerides. In the placebo group, patients with MetS had a higher risk of all outcomes including cardiovascular death: HR = 1.73 (95% CI 1.01-2.98), heart failure hospitalization: HR = 2.64 (95% CI 1.22, 5.72), and new or worsening nephropathy: HR = 3.11 (95% CI 2.17-4.46). The beneficial effect of empagliflozin was consistent on all cardio-renal outcomes regardless of presence of MetS.\nCONCLUSIONS: A large proportion of the EMPA-REG OUTCOME population fulfills the criteria for MetS. Those with MetS had increased risk of adverse cardio-renal outcomes. Compared with placebo, empagliflozin improved cardio-renal outcomes in patients with and without MetS.

This study evaluated 24-h glycemic profiles in patients with type 2 diabetes (T2D) initiated on dapagliflozin treatment using continuous glucose monitoring (CGM).\nMETHODS: This randomized double-blind placebo-controlled multicenter parallel-design 4-week study compared dapagliflozin (10 mg\/d; n = 50) with placebo (n = 50) in adult patients with T2D uncontrolled (HbA1c 7.5%-10.5%) on either stable doses of metformin monotherapy (≥1500 mg\/d) or insulin (≥30 U\/d with or without up to two oral antidiabetes drugs). CGM was used to measure 24-h glycemic profiles for 7 days pretreatment and during week 4 of treatment. The primary outcome was change from baseline in 24-h mean glucose (MG) at week 4.\nRESULTS: The 24-h MG decreased 18.2 mg\/dL with dapagliflozin and increased 5.8 mg\/dL with placebo (P < 0.001). The proportion of time spent in the target glucose range (70-180 mg\/dL) increased significantly with dapagliflozin versus placebo (69.6% vs. 52.9%; P < 0.001), with a small (0.3%) increase in time spent in the hypoglycemic range (<70 mg\/dL), driven by those on background insulin therapy. Dapagliflozin reduced postprandial glucose and significantly decreased overall glucose variability. Few events of symptomatic hypoglycemia occurred. The most common adverse event was urinary tract infection (6% in each treatment arm).\nCONCLUSIONS: Compared with placebo, dapagliflozin improved measures of glycemic control and variability as assessed by CGM.

As the cumulative (daily) amount of glucose excreted in the urine induced by dapagliflozin is dependent upon dapagliflozin AUC, the effect of food on dapagliflozin C(max) is unlikely to have a clinically meaningful effect on dapagliflozin's efficacy.

To that end, we compared two groups assigned to two different doses of luseogliflozin (LUSEO) for 12 weeks. Methods Patients with a hemoglobin A1c (HbA1c) level of 7% or higher already on treatment with luseogliflozin 2.5 mg\/day for 12 weeks or longer were randomly assigned to either the 2.5-mg\/day group (control group) or the 5-mg\/day group (dose-escalation group) of luseogliflozin through the envelope method and were treated for 12 weeks. Blood and urine samples were collected at two different time points: at weeks 0 and 12 after randomization. The primary outcome was the change in HbA1c from the baseline to 12 weeks.

        "Published":"2019-08-10",
        "Abstract":"Sodium-glucose cotransporter 2 (SGLT2) inhibitors are a unique class of oral anti-hyperglycaemic medications that act to reduce glucose reabsorption in the renal proximal tubules, thereby enhancing urinary glucose excretion. Large randomized placebo-controlled trials in people with diabetes at high cardiovascular risk have demonstrated that SGLT2 inhibitors reduce heart failure hospitalization within months of commencing therapy. These findings are of considerable interest, as diabetes is associated with an increased risk of both heart failure with reduced ejection fraction and heart failure with preserved ejection fraction. In addition, left ventricular (LV) hypertrophy and impaired diastolic function is thought to be more prevalent in people with diabetes. Although many hypotheses have been proposed, the underlying mechanisms through which SGLT2 inhibitors reduce the risk of heart failure in people with diabetes are not fully understood. Given the rapid reduction in heart failure hospitalization, it is conceivable that the benefits of SGLT2 inhibitors are due to favourable haemodynamic and metabolic effects on LV function. Several clinical studies have been conducted to investigate the effect of SGLT2 inhibitors on LV structure and function and have found that LV mass index and diastolic function improve following SGLT2 inhibitor therapy in people with type 2 diabetes. If these findings are confirmed in future studies utilizing novel cardiac imaging modalities and large randomized controlled trials, then this will bring new hope for the prevention and management of heart failure with preserved ejection fraction, for which no current treatments have been shown to reduce mortality. At the present time, SGLT2 inhibitors are indicated for the treatment of type 2 diabetes; however, the results of ongoing trials in participants with heart failure but without diabetes are eagerly awaited. The purpose of this review is to summarize current knowledge regarding the effects of SGLT2 inhibitors on LV function, particularly the findings from clinical studies, proposed biological mechanisms, and future directions.",

        "Abstract":"AIM: Post-hoc analysis of the efficacy and safety of ertugliflozin in East\/Southeast (E\/SE) Asian patients with type 2 diabetes mellitus (T2DM).\nMATERIALS AND METHODS: Efficacy evaluations used data from randomized, double-blind, phase 3 studies: a pool of two 26-week placebo-controlled studies and one 52-week active-comparator (glimepiride) study. Least squares mean change from baseline was calculated for HbA1c, fasting plasma glucose (FPG), body weight (BW) and systolic blood pressure (SBP). Safety evaluation included overall and prespecified adverse events based on pooled data (broad pool) from seven phase 3 studies (including studies in the efficacy analysis).\nRESULTS: Among 161 E\/SE Asian patients in the placebo pool (ertugliflozin, n = 106), ertugliflozin reduced HbA1c, FPG, BW and SBP from baseline at week 26. The placebo-adjusted changes from baseline for ertugliflozin 5 and 15 mg were: HbA1c, -0.9% and -1.0%; BW, -2.1 and -1.9 kg; and SBP, -3.3 and -3.5 mmHg, respectively. Among 174 E\/SE Asian patients in the active-comparator study (ertugliflozin, n = 118), HbA1c changes from baseline at week 52 were -0.6%, -0.6% and -0.7% for ertugliflozin 5 mg, 15 mg and glimepiride, respectively.

The association with cardiac remodeling has not been investigated.\nOBJECTIVE: To investigate the outcome of the SGLT2i empagliflozin, compared with placebo, on cardiac remodeling in patients with HFrEF.\nDESIGN, SETTING, AND PARTICIPANTS: This exploratory post hoc analysis included participants with stable HFrEF and ejection fractions of 40% or less, who were randomly enrolled in an investigator-initiated, multicenter, double-blind, placebo-controlled randomized clinical trial in Denmark. Enrollment commenced on June 29, 2017, and continued through September 10, 2019, with the last participant follow-up on December 20, 2019.\nINTERVENTIONS: Randomization (1:1) to empagliflozin (10 mg once daily) or matching placebo in addition to recommended heart failure therapy for 12 weeks.\nMAIN OUTCOMES AND MEASURES: Efficacy measures were changes from baseline to week 12 in left ventricular end-systolic and end-diastolic volume indexes, left atrial volume index, and left ventricular ejection fraction adjusted for age, sex, type 2 diabetes, and atrial fibrillation. Secondary efficacy measures included changes in left ventricular mass index, global longitudinal strain, and relative wall thickness.\nRESULTS: A total of 190 patients were randomized (95 each receiving empagliflozin and placebo), with a mean (SD) age of 64 (11) years; 162 were men (85.3%), 97 (51.1%) had ischemic HFrEF, 24 (12.6%) had type 2 diabetes, and the mean (SD) latest recorded left ventricular ejection fraction was 29% (8%). Of the 190, 186 completed the study. Empagliflozin significantly reduced left ventricular end-systolic volume index (-4.3 [95% CI, -8.5 to -0.1] mL\/m2; P = .04), left ventricular end-diastolic volume index (-5.5 [95% CI, -10.6 to -0.4] mL\/m2; P = .03), and left atrial volume index (-2.5 [95% CI, -4.8 to -0.1] mL\/m2; P = .04) compared with placebo at 12 weeks' follow-up, with no change in left ventricular ejection fraction (1.2% [95% CI, -1.2% to 3.6%]; P = .32). These findings were consistent across subgroups. Of secondary efficacy measures, left ventricular mass index was significantly reduced by empagliflozin (-9.0 [95% CI, -17.2 to -0.8] g\/m2; P = .03).\nCONCLUSIONS AND RELEVANCE: In this small, randomized, short-term study, empagliflozin was associated with modest reductions in left ventricular and left atrial volumes with no association with ejection fraction. Effects beyond 12 weeks of SGLT2i use require further study.\nTRIAL REGISTRATION: ClinicalTrials.gov Identifier: NCT03198585.",

We assessed risk of cardiorenal outcomes, mortality and safety in patients with versus without COPD in the EMPA-REG OUTCOME trial.\nMETHODS: Patients (n = 7,020) with T2DM and CV disease (CVD) were treated with empagliflozin (10 mg or 25 mg) or placebo. Cox regression was used to assess COPD subgroup (placebo only) associations with, and treatment effects of empagliflozin versus placebo on first hospitalization for HF (HHF), CV death, all-cause mortality, incident\/worsening nephropathy, and all-cause hospitalization.\nRESULTS: At baseline, patients with COPD (n = 707) had more HF and used insulin more frequently than those without COPD. During follow-up in the placebo group, those with baseline COPD had increased risk of HHF (HR 2.15 [95% CI 1.32, 3.49]), HHF\/CV death (1.60 [1.10, 2.33]), incident\/worsening nephropathy (1.68 [1.26, 2.24]), all-cause hospitalization (1.44 [1.19, 1.74]) and all-cause death (1.60 [1.09, 2.35]) compared to those without COPD. Empagliflozin consistently reduced all clinical outcomes, irrespective of COPD status (interaction p-values 0.14 to 0.96), with a confirmed safety profile.\nCONCLUSIONS: In patients with T2DM and CVD, COPD increased the risk of mortality and cardiorenal outcomes, including HF. Empagliflozin consistently reduced these outcomes versus placebo regardless of COPD, suggesting that empagliflozin's benefits in patients with T2DM and CVD are not mitigated by the presence of COPD.",

The aim of this network meta-analysis was to evaluate the relative efficacy of SGLT2 inhibitor (SGLT2i), RAS inhibitor (RASi) and ARN inhibitor (ARNI) in different types of heart failure.\nMETHODS: A systemic literature search was performed from inception to 19 November 2022 for randomized control trials assessing the risk of cardiovascular (CV) death or hospitalization for heart failure (HHF) of these drugs in HF. A network meta-analysis was performed. Risk ratio (RR) with 95% confidence intervals (CI) were synthesized.\nRESULTS: Seventeen studies were selected with a total of 61 489 patients. In patients with HFrEF, ARNI led to a reduced risk of a composite outcome of CV death or HHF when compared with placebo (RR = 0.83, 95% CI 0.77-0.89). Similar trends were observed when focusing on the outcome of CV death or HHF alone. In patients with HFpEF, SGLT2i showed the beneficial effects on the CV death or HHF events when compared with placebo and RASi (RR = 0.82, 95% CI 0.74-0.92; RR = 1.16, 95% CI 1.02-1.31). For CV death, all these three drugs could not show beneficial effects in HFpEF. For the incidence of HHF in HFpEF, both SGLT2i and ARNI demonstrated the beneficial effects but SGLT2i was superior to ARNI. There were no differences in the events of discontinuation under these drugs when compared with placebo or each other in either HFrEF or HFpEF patients. SGLT2i showed the least renal injury among these interventions in HFrEF and there were no differences in the incidence of renal injury of these interventions in HFpEF.\nCONCLUSIONS: Among these drugs, ARNI showed the greatest ability to lower the incidence of CV death or HHF and SGLT2i exerted the least renal injury in patients with HFrEF. In patients with HFpEF, SGLT2i was associated with a reduction in the risk of CV death or HHF. There were no differences in the incidence of renal injury of these interventions in HFpEF.

        "Abstract":"INTRODUCTION: To compare the efficacy and tolerability of dapagliflozin with those of sitagliptin and metformin in patients with type 2 diabetes who have never received glucose-lowering agents.\nMETHODS: In this randomized, 12-week, open-label, active-controlled trial, 32 patients were randomly assigned to receive dapagliflozin 5 mg, sitagliptin 50 mg, or metformin 1000 mg per day for 12 weeks. At baseline and at week 12, the patients underwent a meal tolerance test (MTT).\nRESULTS: After 12 weeks of treatment, the changes in fasting and postprandial plasma glucose and plasma glucose area under the curve (AUC) levels during the MTT from baseline were significantly improved in the three study groups, and there were no significant differences among the three study groups (P < 0.05). The mean changes in glycated hemoglobin (HbA1c) from baseline to week 12 were - 0.96%, - 1.24%, and - 1.40% in the dapagliflozin, sitagliptin, and metformin groups, respectively. Although there was no significant difference among the three study groups, the lowering effect of HbA1c tended to be greater in the metformin group than in the dapagliflozin group. In contrast, the insulin AUC levels at week 12 significantly decreased only in the dapagliflozin group (P = 0.049). Similarly, body weight was significantly reduced only in the dapagliflozin group (- 2.1 kg [- 2.7%], P = 0.047). Moreover, dapagliflozin significantly improved serum adiponectin levels (P = 0.003). However, there were no significant differences in the changes in these glycemic and metabolic parameters among the three study groups. No serious adverse events were documented in any group.\nCONCLUSIONS: Dapagliflozin exerted beneficial effects similar to sitagliptin and metformin on glycemic parameters. In addition, dapagliflozin significantly reduced body weight and insulin AUC levels and improved serum adiponectin levels. Therefore, we suggest that these three hypoglycemic agents could be viable first-line medications for drug-naïve Japanese patients with type 2 diabetes.\nTRIAL REGISTRATION: University Hospital Medical Information Network (UMIN000024427).",

Patients with CKD carry a high burden of cardiovascular disease and may be excluded from clinical trials on the basis of safety. There are an increasing number of clinical trials which predefine sub-group analysis for CKD. This systematic review with fixed-effect meta-analysis investigates glucose lowering therapy and cardiovascular outcomes in relation to CKD. We included randomized controlled trials (RCT) of glucose lowering treatments performed in adults (aged ≥18 years), humans, with no restriction on date, and English-language restriction in patients with pre-existing CKD regardless of diabetes status. Embase & Ovid Medline databases were searched up to April 2021. Risk of bias was assessed according to Revised Cochrane risk-of-bias tool. We included 7 trials involving a total of 48,801 participants. There were 4 sodium-glucose cotransporter-2 inhibitors (SGLT2i), 2 glucagon-like peptide-1 receptor (GLP-1R) agonists and 1 Dipeptidyl-peptidase 4 (DPP4) inhibitor identified. SGLT2i (relative risk (RR) = 0.90, 95% confidence interval (CI) [0.79-1.02]) and GLP-1R agonists (RR = 0.83, 95% CI [0.72-0.96]) were associated with a reduction in cardiovascular death. SGLT2i (RR = 0.69, 95% CI [0.63-0.75]) are also associated with a reduction in hospitalization for heart failure. In summary, this meta-analysis of large, RCTs of glucose lowering therapies has demonstrated that treatment with SGLT2i or GLP-1R agonists may improve 3 point-MACE and cardiovascular outcomes in patients with chronic renal failure compared with placebo.

Dapagliflozin 5 and 10 mg compared with placebo reduced UACR by - 47.1% (95% CI -64.8 to - 20.6) and -38.4% (95% CI -57.6 to - 10.3), respectively. Additionally, dapagliflozin 5 and 10 mg compared with placebo reduced BP and body weight. eGFR increased with placebo during the first 4 weeks but did not change with dapagliflozin. There were no between-group differences in eGFR at the end of follow-up. Adverse events associated with renal function occurred more frequently in the dapagliflozin 10-mg group. These events were mainly asymptomatic increases in serum creatinine.\nCONCLUSIONS: Dapagliflozin did not decrease HbA1c in patients with type 2 diabetes and Stages 3b-4 CKD, but decreased UACR, BP and body weight to a clinically meaningful extent. These results support a large outcome trial in this population to confirm long-term safety and efficacy in reducing adverse clinical endpoints.",

Assessments included adverse events (AEs) and pharmacokinetic and pharmacodynamic endpoints.\nRESULTS: Empagliflozin exposure increased dose-proportionally over the dose range 10-100 mg and showed linear pharmacokinetics with respect to time. Urinary glucose excretion (UGE) increased from baseline to day 1 by 74, 90 and 81 g with empagliflozin 10, 25 and 100 mg, respectively. The increases in UGE were maintained over 28 days with multiple dosing. Virtually no change in UGE was observed in the placebo group. Significant reductions from baseline in mean daily plasma glucose and fasting plasma glucose were observed with empagliflozin compared with placebo. The incidence of AEs was similar in the empagliflozin and placebo groups (50.0, 56.3 and 66.7% with empagliflozin rising doses and 62.5% with placebo).

        "Abstract":"2\n['P', 'P']\nBackground The sodium-glucose cotransporter 2 inhibitor canagliflozin reduced the risk of first cardiovascular composite events in the CREDENCE (Canagliflozin and Renal Events in Diabetes With Established Nephropathy Clinical Evaluation) trial. In this post hoc analysis, we evaluated the effect of canagliflozin on total (first and recurrent) cardiovascular events. Methods and Results The CREDENCE trial compared canagliflozin or matching placebo in 4401 patients with type 2 diabetes, albuminuria, and estimated glomerular filtration rate of 30 to <90 mL\/min per 1.73 m, over a median of 2.6 years. The primary outcome was analyzed as a composite of any cardiovascular event including myocardial infarction, stroke, hospitalization for heart failure, hospitalization for unstable angina, and cardiovascular death. Negative binomial regression models were used to assess the effect of canagliflozin on the net burden of cardiovascular events. During the trial, 634 patients had 883 cardiovascular events, of whom 472 (74%) had just 1 cardiovascular event and 162 (26%) had multiple cardiovascular events. Canagliflozin reduced first cardiovascular events by 26% (hazard ratio, 0.74 [95% CI, 0.63-0.86]; <0.001) and total cardiovascular events by 29% (incidence rate ratio, 0.71 [95% CI, 0.59-0.86]; <0.001). The absolute risk difference per 1000 patients treated over 2.5 years was -44 (95% CI, -67 to -21) first cardiovascular events and -73 (95% CI, -114 to -33) total events. Conclusions Canagliflozin reduced cardiovascular events, with a larger absolute benefit for total cardiovascular than first cardiovascular events. These findings provide further support for the benefit of continuing canagliflozin therapy after an initial event to prevent recurrent cardiovascular events.

        "Published":null,
        "Abstract":"BACKGROUND: In our 2015 systematic review and meta-analysis of cardiovascular outcome trials for glucose-lowering drugs or strategies in people with or at risk of type 2 diabetes, we reported a modest reduction in atherosclerotic cardiovascular events and an increased risk of heart failure, but with heterogeneous effects by drug or intervention type. In view of the completion of many large cardiovascular outcome trials since our previous analysis, including trials of novel drugs that have shown beneficial effects on cardiovascular outcomes, we aimed to update our analysis to incorporate these findings.\nMETHODS: We did an updated systematic review and meta-analysis of large cardiovascular outcome trials of glucose-lowering drugs or strategies in people with or at risk of type 2 diabetes. We searched Ovid MEDLINE, PubMed, and the Cochrane Central Register of Controlled Trials databases for reports of trials published from Nov 15, 2013 to Nov 20, 2019. We included randomised controlled trials with a minimum of 1000 adults (aged ≥19 years) with or at risk of type 2 diabetes, with major adverse cardiovascular events (MACE) as an outcome, and with follow-up of at least 12 months. We excluded trials with patients enrolled with an acute cardiovascular event. The main outcomes of interest were MACE (generally defined as a composite of cardiovascular death, myocardial infarction, or stroke) and heart failure. We calculated pooled risk ratios (RRs) and 95% CIs with inverse-variance random-effects models, did meta-regression to analyse treatment effects per difference in bodyweight achieved, and explored results stratified by baseline subgroups.\nFINDINGS: Our updated search yielded 30 eligible trials (n=225 305). The mean age of participants was 63·0 years (SD 8·4) and mean duration of diabetes was 9·4 years (6·6). After a mean follow-up of 3·8 years (1·8), 23 016 (10·2%) participants had MACE and 8169 (3·6%) had a heart failure event. Glucose-lowering drugs or strategies lowered the risk of MACE compared with standard care or placebo (RR 0·92, 95% CI 0·89-0·95, p<0·0001), with no overall effect on the risk of heart failure (0·98, 0·90-1·08, p=0·71). However, across drug classes or strategies, the magnitude and directionality of RR for heart failure varied (p<0·0001), with meta-regression showing that a decrease in bodyweight of 1 kg was associated with a 5·9% (3·9-8·0) relative decrease in the risk of heart failure (p<0·0001). Among trials that assessed drug classes or strategies associated with weight loss (intensive lifestyle changes, GLP-1 receptor agonists, or SGLT2 inhibitors), the risk reduction for MACE was consistent among participants with (0·87, 0·83-0·92) and without (0·92, 0·83-1·02) established cardiovascular disease at baseline (p=0·33). For heart failure, the RR for drug classes or strategies associated with weight loss was consistent among participants with (0·80, 0·73-0·89) and without (0·84, 0·74-0·95) cardiovascular disease at baseline (p=0·63).\nINTERPRETATION: Glucose-lowering drugs or strategies overall reduced the risk of fatal and non-fatal atherosclerotic events. The effect on heart failure was neutral overall but varied substantially by intervention type, with interventions associated with weight loss showing a beneficial effect. The cardiovascular and heart failure benefits of interventions associated with weight loss might extend to patients without established cardiovascular disease.\nFUNDING: None.",

        "Published":"2022-11-17",
        "Abstract":"BACKGROUND: The syndrome of inappropriate antidiuresis (SIAD) is characterized by a reduction of free water excretion with consecutive hypotonic hyponatremia and is therefore challenging to treat. The sodium-glucose cotransporter 2 (SGLT2) inhibitor empagliflozin promotes osmotic diuresis via urinary glucose excretion, likely leading to increased electrolyte free water clearance.\nMETHODS: In this randomized, double-blind, placebo-controlled, crossover trial, we compared 4-week treatment with empagliflozin 25 mg\/d to placebo in outpatients with chronic SIAD-induced hyponatremia. At baseline and after both treatment cycles, patients underwent different assessments including neurocognitive testing (Montreal Cognitive Assessment [MoCA]). The primary end point was the difference in serum sodium levels between treatments.\nRESULTS: Fourteen patients, 50% female, with a median age of 72 years (interquartile range [IQR], 65-77), completed the trial. Median serum sodium level at baseline was 131 mmol\/L (IQR, 130-132). After treatment with empagliflozin, median serum sodium level rose to 134 mmol\/L (IQR, 132-136), whereas no increase was seen with placebo (130 mmol\/L; IQR, 128-132), corresponding to a serum sodium increase of 4.1 mmol\/L (95% confidence interval [CI], 1.7 to 6.5; P =0.004). Exploratory analyses showed that treatment with empagliflozin led to improved neurocognitive function with an increase of 1.16 (95% CI, 0.05 to 2.26) in the MoCA score. Treatment was well tolerated; no serious adverse events were reported.\nCONCLUSION: The SGLT2 inhibitor empagliflozin is a promising new treatment option for chronic SIAD-induced hyponatremia, possibly improving neurocognitive function. Larger studies are needed to confirm the observed treatment effects.\nCLINICAL TRIAL REGISTRATION NUMBER: ClinicalTrials.gov NCT03202667.\nPODCAST: This article contains a podcast at.",

The EMPA-KIDNEY trial was designed to assess the effects of treatment with empagliflozin in a broad range of such patients.\nMETHODS: We enrolled patients with chronic kidney disease who had an estimated glomerular filtration rate (eGFR) of at least 20 but less than 45 ml per minute per 1.73 m of body-surface area, or who had an eGFR of at least 45 but less than 90 ml per minute per 1.73 m with a urinary albumin-to-creatinine ratio (with albumin measured in milligrams and creatinine measured in grams) of at least 200. Patients were randomly assigned to receive empagliflozin (10 mg once daily) or matching placebo. The primary outcome was a composite of progression of kidney disease (defined as end-stage kidney disease, a sustained decrease in eGFR to <10 ml per minute per 1.73 m, a sustained decrease in eGFR of ≥40% from baseline, or death from renal causes) or death from cardiovascular causes.\nRESULTS: A total of 6609 patients underwent randomization. During a median of 2.0 years of follow-up, progression of kidney disease or death from cardiovascular causes occurred in 432 of 3304 patients (13.1%) in the empagliflozin group and in 558 of 3305 patients (16.9%) in the placebo group (hazard ratio, 0.72; 95% confidence interval [CI], 0.64 to 0.82; P<0.001). Results were consistent among patients with or without diabetes and across subgroups defined according to eGFR ranges. The rate of hospitalization from any cause was lower in the empagliflozin group than in the placebo group (hazard ratio, 0.86; 95% CI, 0.78 to 0.95; P = 0.003), but there were no significant between-group differences with respect to the composite outcome of hospitalization for heart failure or death from cardiovascular causes (which occurred in 4.0% in the empagliflozin group and 4.6% in the placebo group) or death from any cause (in 4.5% and 5.1%, respectively). The rates of serious adverse events were similar in the two groups.\nCONCLUSIONS: Among a wide range of patients with chronic kidney disease who were at risk for disease progression, empagliflozin therapy led to a lower risk of progression of kidney disease or death from cardiovascular causes than placebo.

We compared the efficacy and safety of canagliflozin, an SGLT2 inhibitor, with glimepiride in patients with type 2 diabetes inadequately controlled with metformin.\nMETHODS: We undertook this 52 week, randomised, double-blind, active-controlled, phase 3 non-inferiority trial at 157 centres in 19 countries between Aug 28, 2009, and Dec 21, 2011. Patients aged 18-80 years with type 2 diabetes and glycated haemoglobin A1c (HbA1c) of 7·0-9·5% on stable metformin were randomly assigned (1:1:1) by computer-generated random sequence via an interactive voice or web response system to receive canagliflozin 100 mg or 300 mg, or glimepiride (up-titrated to 6 mg or 8 mg per day) orally once daily. Patients, study investigators, and local sponsor personnel were masked to treatment. The primary endpoint was change in HbA1c from baseline to week 52, with a non-inferiority margin of 0·3% for the comparison of each canagliflozin dose with glimepiride. If non-inferiority was shown, we assessed superiority on the basis of an upper bound of the 95% CI for the difference of each canagliflozin dose versus glimepiride of less than 0·0%. Analysis was done in a modified intention-to-treat population, including all randomised patients who received at least one dose of study drug. This study is registered with ClinicalTrials.gov, number NCT00968812.\nFINDINGS: 1450 of 1452 randomised patients received at least one dose of glimepiride (n=482), canagliflozin 100 mg (n=483), or canagliflozin 300 mg (n=485). For lowering of HbA1c at 52 weeks, canagliflozin 100 mg was non-inferior to glimepiride (least-squares mean difference -0·01% [95% CI -0·11 to 0·09]), and canagliflozin 300 mg was superior to glimepiride (-0·12% [-0·22 to -0·02]). 39 (8%) patients had serious adverse events in the glimepiride group versus 24 (5%) in the canagliflozin 100 mg group and 26 (5%) in the 300 mg group. In the canagliflozin 100 mg and 300 mg groups versus the glimepiride group, we recorded a greater number of genital mycotic infections (women: 26 [11%] and 34 [14%] vs five [2%]; men: 17 [7%] and 20 [8%] vs three [1%]), urinary tract infections (31 [6%] for both canagliflozin doses vs 22 [5%]), and osmotic diuresis-related events (pollakiuria: 12 [3%] for both doses vs one [<1%]; polyuria: four [<1%] for both doses vs two [<1%]).\nINTERPRETATION: Canagliflozin provides greater HbA1c reduction than does glimepiride, and is well tolerated in patients with type 2 diabetes receiving metformin.

Patients were stratified by body mass index (BMI, kg\/m2): normal (18.5 to <25), overweight (25 to <30), moderately obese (30 to <35), severely obese (35 to <40), and very-severely obese (≥40). Outcomes analysed were CV death, hospitalization for heart failure (HHF), renal-specific composite outcome, and atrial fibrillation or flutter (AF\/AFL). Of 17 134 patients, 9.0% had a normal BMI, 31.5% were overweight, 32.4% were moderately, 17.2% severely, and 9.8% were very-severely obese. Higher BMI was associated with a higher adjusted risk of HHF and AF\/AFL (hazard ratio 1.30 and 1.28, respectively, per 5 kg\/m2; P < 0.001 for all). Dapagliflozin reduced body weight by similar relative amounts consistently across BMI categories (percent difference: -1.9 to -2.4%). Although relative risk reductions in CV and renal-specific composite outcomes with dapagliflozin did not significantly differ across the range of BMI (P for interaction ≥0.20 for all outcomes), obese patients (BMI ≥ 30 kg\/m2) tended to derive greater absolute risk reduction in HHF and AF\/AFL (P for interaction 0.02 and 0.09, respectively) than non-obese patients.\nCONCLUSIONS: In DECLARE-TIMI 58, patients with T2DM and higher BMI were more likely to have HHF and AF\/AFL.

We assessed the efficacy of dapagliflozin on reducing the rate of total (ie, first and repeat) hospitalizations for heart failure in the DAPA-HF trial (Dapagliflozin and Prevention of Adverse-Outcomes in Heart Failure).\nMETHODS: The total number of HF hospitalizations and cardiovascular deaths was examined by using the proportional-rates approach of Lei-Wei-Yang-Ying and a joint frailty model for each of recurrent HF hospitalizations and time to cardiovascular death. Variables associated with the risk of recurrent hospitalizations were explored in a multivariable Lei-Wei-Yang-Ying model.\nRESULTS: Of 2371 participants randomly assigned to placebo, 318 experienced 469 hospitalizations for HF; of 2373 assigned to dapagliflozin, 230 patients experienced 340 admissions. In a multivariable model, factors associated with a higher risk of recurrent HF hospitalizations included higher heart rate, higher N-terminal pro-B-type natriuretic peptide, and New York Heart Association class. In the Lei-Wei-Yang-Ying model, the rate ratio for the effect of dapagliflozin on recurrent HF hospitalizations or cardiovascular death was 0.75 (95% CI, 0.65-0.88), =0.0002.

        "Abstract":"AIMS: We aimed to assess whether the safety outcomes exerted by sodium-glucose cotransporter 2 (SGLT2) inhibitors were associated with different renal function at baseline.\nDATA SYNTHESIS: We searched randomized controlled trials comparing SGLT2 inhibitors with placebo in participants simultaneously involving the entire range of estimated glomerular filtration rate (eGFR) levels at baseline in one study. According to eGFR, we divided the population into two subgroups with eGFR <60 ml\/min\/1.73 m and eGFR≥60 ml\/min\/1.73 m. Data from the CANVAS program, CREDENCE, EMPA-REG OUTCOME, DECLARE-TIMI 58, DAPA-HF, and EMPA-REG RENAL were included. SGLT2 inhibitors significantly reduced the risk of all serious adverse events (HR 0.91 [95% CI 0.87 to 0.95], p < 0.001) and acute kidney injury (HR 0.74 [95% CI 0.64 to 0.85], p < 0.001). Except for high risk of genital infection, SGLT2 inhibitors did not increase the risk of amputation, fracture, hyperkalemia, hypoglycemia, volume depletion, or urinary tract infection. Further analyses showed that these safety outcomes were similar between subgroups (p-interaction > 0.05). For osmotic diuresis, SGLT2 inhibitors significantly increased the risk by 75% (p = 0.036), and subgroup analyses showed that this effect was completely attributed to the increase in patients with eGFR ≥60 ml\/min\/1.73 m (p-interaction<0.001).\nCONCLUSION: The indication of no risk of osmotic diuresis in patients with eGFR<60 ml\/min\/1.73 m and the consistency of other safety outcomes across different baseline renal function may allow additional individuals to safely use SGLT2 inhibitors.",

        "Published":"2020-11-09",
        "Abstract":"Randomized controlled trials (RCTs) have consistently shown glycemic and extra-glycemic benefits of long-acting injectable glucagon-like-peptide-1 receptor agonists (GLP-1RAs, liraglutide, albiglutide, exenatide once-weekly, dulaglutide, and semaglutide) in terms of reduction in the rates of cardiovascular events and mortality among patients with type 2 diabetes. Recently, the analyses of large datasets collecting routinely-accumulated data from clinical practice (ie, real-world studies, RWS) have provided new opportunities to complement the information obtained from RCTs. In this narrative review, we addressed clinically relevant questions that might be answered by well-conducted RWS: are subjects treated with GLP-1RAs in the \"real-world\" similar to those included in RCTs? Is the performance of GLP-1RA observed in the RWS (effectiveness) similar to that described in RCTs (efficacy)? Is the effectiveness similar in population of patients generally under-represented in RCTs? Are the cardiovascular benefits of GLP-1RAs confirmed in RWS? We also describe a few comparisons currently un-explored by specific RCTs, such as direct comparison between different administration strategies (eg, fixed- versus flexible-combination with basal-insulin) or between GLP-1RAs versus dipeptidyl-peptidase-4 inhibitor (DDP4i) or versus sodium\/glucose cotransporter-2 inhibitors (SGLT-2i) on hard cardio-renal outcomes. Altogether, RWS provide highly informative information on treatment with GLP-1RAs. On the one side, RWS showed different clinical characteristics between subjects enrolled in RCTs versus those attending real-world clinics and receiving a GLP-1RA. On the other hand, RWS showed that GLP-1RA effectiveness is overall consistent in subgroups of patients less represented in RCTs. In addition, RWS allowed the identification of modifiable factors (eg, titration or adherence) that might guide physicians towards better GLP-1RAs use. Finally, multiple RWS reported better cardio-renal outcomes with GLP-1RAs than with DPP-4i, while initial findings from RWS described a weaker cardiovascular protection compared to SGLT-2i. Therefore, there is the need for further RWS and RCTs comparing these different classes of glucose lowering medications.",

Key secondary endpoints were waist circumference and dual-energy x-ray absorptiometry total-body fat mass (FM) changes from baseline at wk 24, and patient proportion achieving body weight reduction of at least 5% at wk 24. In a subset of patients, magnetic resonance assessment of visceral adipose tissue (VAT) and sc adipose tissue (SAT) volume and hepatic lipid content were also evaluated.\nRESULTS: At wk 24, placebo-corrected changes with dapagliflozin were as follows: TBW, -2.08 kg [95% confidence interval (CI)=-2.84 to -1.31; P<0.0001]; waist circumference, -1.52 cm (95% CI=-2.74 to -0.31; P=0.0143); FM, -1.48 kg (95% CI=-2.22 to -0.74; P=0.0001); proportion of patients achieving weight reduction of at least 5%, +26.2% (95% CI=15.5 to 36.7; P<0.0001); VAT, -258.4 cm3 (95% CI=-448.1 to -68.6; nominal P=0.0084); SAT, -184.9 cm3 (95% CI=-359.7 to -10.1; nominal P=0.0385). In the dapagliflozin vs. placebo groups, respectively, serious adverse events were reported in 6.6 vs. 1.1%; events suggestive of vulvovaginitis, balanitis, and related genital infection in 3.3 vs. 0%; and lower urinary tract infections in 6.6 vs. 2.2%.\nCONCLUSIONS: Dapagliflozin reduces TBW, predominantly by reducing FM, VAT and SAT in T2DM inadequately controlled with metformin.",

The 63 patients in the treatment group received an SGLT-2 inhibitor in addition to routine insulin therapy, while the control group received only insulin to control blood glucose. All laboratory indexes were recorded before and after treatment with the SGLT-2 inhibitor. The prognosis of patients was followed-up. Simultaneously, 63 healthy and BMI-matched in-patients were selected as the healthy control group. Peripheral blood samples were collected from all groups, and the levels of ROS were measured by ELISA.\nRESULTS: Renal function indexes such as urinary protein, creatinine, blood urea nitrogen, and glomerular filtration rate (GFR) were significantly higher with SGLT-2 inhibitor treatment compared with the control group (p<0.05). The fasting blood glucose level was not significantly increased before or after treatment (p>0.05). The levels of ROS in peripheral blood were significantly lower in the treatment group than in the control group (p<0.05). Observation at the 1-year follow-up showed that the average GFR was significantly higher in the treatment group than in the control group. Furthermore, the proportion of patients with stage 1-3 chronic kidney disease was significantly higher in the treatment group than in the control group (p<0.05).\nCONCLUSIONS: The SGLT-2 inhibitor had a good therapeutic effect on renal function in patients with diabetic nephropathy, without having effects on fasting blood glucose. Additionally, it significantly delayed the progression of nephropathy. It is therefore worth clinical promotion.",

In this substudy from the SIMPLE-trial, we investigated short-term empagliflozin therapy's effects on CAT in patients with type 2 diabetes.\nRESEARCH DESIGN AND METHODS: Between 4 April 2017 and 11 May 2020, we randomized 90 patients with type 2 diabetes and established or high risk of cardiovascular disease to 25 mg empagliflozin or placebo for 13 weeks. The substudy focused on change in CAT evaluated by images acquired during  Rubidium-positron emissions tomography\/computed tomography. The analysis included 78 patients who had at least one scan. Furthermore, we report on the relation to the concurrent effects on left ventricular mass, end-diastolic volume and end-systolic volume, body composition and glucometabolic status.\nRESULTS: Mean ± SD baseline CAT was 258.5 ± 117.9 ml. Empagliflozin reduced CAT after 13 weeks by 12.41 ml [95% CI (-23.83 to -0.99), p = .034] as compared with placebo. Similarly, left ventricular mass [-5.16 g, 95% CI (-8.80 to -1.52), p = .006], end-diastolic volume and end-systolic volume decreased with empagliflozin. In addition, significant improvements were observed in body composition, with reduced total fat mass, and in measures of glucose and lipid metabolism. However, no correlation was observed between changes in CAT and changes in cardiac parameters and change in CAT appeared mediated primarily by concurrent change in weight.\nCONCLUSIONS: Empagliflozin provides an early reduction of CAT; however, no association was observed with concurrent changes in cardiac volumetrics.",

        "Abstract":"WHAT IS KNOWN AND OBJECTIVE: As an oral hypoglycaemic drug that significantly reduces cardiovascular risk, empagliflozin is often used in patients with type 2 diabetes mellitus (T2DM). However, the dosage and administration of empagliflozin are still controversial clinically. To determine the most appropriate dose, we performed this network meta-analysis.\nMETHODS: We identified randomized controlled trials (RCTs) about empagliflozin from eight databases. We analysed the pharmacodynamics, adverse effects (AEs), and pharmacokinetics of empagliflozin at different doses.\nRESULTS: We identified 8264 articles, of which 23 RCTs with 10518 patients were included. Regarding haemoglobin A1c (HbA1c) and fasting plasma glucose (FPG), high-daily doses (10, 25, 50 mg) were significantly better than low doses (1, 2.5, 5 mg). For total AEs, there was a dose-response trend in which safety decreased with increasing doses. According to SUCRA sequencing, the order for lowering HbA1c was 25 > 50 > 10 > 5 > 1 mg, for lowering FPG was 50 > 25 > 10 > 5 > 2.5 > 1 mg and for safety was 1> 5 > 10 > 25> 2.5 > 50 mg. When considering HbA1c, FPG and total AEs, we performed a hierarchical cluster analysis and network meta-analysis to find that 25 mg performed best among different doses, which was more significant after long-term use (≥ 12 weeks). Pharmacokinetic parameters exhibited significant dose-response relationships.\nWHAT IS NEW AND CONCLUSION: High-daily doses (10, 25, 50 mg) had better efficacy than low doses (1, 2.5, 5 mg).

        "Abstract":"Cirrhosis is a leading cause of morbidity and mortality, impacting more than 120 million people worldwide. Although geographic differences exist, etiologic factors such as alcohol use disorder, chronic viral hepatitis infections, and non-alcoholic fatty liver disease are prevalent in nearly every region. Historically, significant effort has been devoted to modifying these risks to prevent disease progression. Nevertheless, more than 11% of patients with compensated cirrhosis experience hepatic decompensation each year. This transition signifies the most important prognostic factor in the natural history of the disease, corresponding to a decline in median survival to below 2 years. Over the past decade, the need for pharmacotherapies aimed at reducing the risk for hepatic decompensation has been emphasized, and non-selective beta-blockers have emerged as the most effective option to date. However, a critical therapeutic gap still exists, and additional therapies have been proposed, including statins, rifaximin, and sodium-glucose cotransporter-2 inhibitors. Based on the results of innovative retrospective analyses and small-scale prospective trials, these pharmacotherapies represent promising options, but further studies, including randomized controlled trials, are necessary before they can be incorporated into clinical use. This report highlights the potential impact of these agents and others in preventing hepatic decompensation and discusses how this paradigm shift may pave the way for guideline-directed medical therapy in cirrhosis.",

        "Abstract":"Type 2 diabetes individuals are at high risk for macrovascular complications: myocardial infarction, stroke and cardiovascular mortality. Recent cardiovascular outcome trials have demonstrated that agents in two antidiabetic classes (SGLT2 inhibitors and GLP-1 receptor agonists) reduce major adverse cardiovascular events. However, there is strong evidence that an older and now generically available medication, the thiazolidinedione, pioglitazone, can retard the atherosclerotic process (PERISCOPE and Chicago) and reduce cardiovascular events in large randomized prospective cardiovascular outcome trials (IRIS and PROactive). Pioglitazone is a potent insulin sensitizer, preserves beta-cell function, causes durable reduction in HbA1c, corrects multiple components of metabolic syndrome and improves nonalcoholic fatty liver disease\/nonalcoholic steatohepatitis. Adverse effects (weight gain, fluid retention, fractures) must be considered, but are diminished with lower doses and are arguably outweighed by these multiple benefits. With healthcare expenses attributable to diabetes increasing rapidly, this cost-effective drug requires reconsideration in the therapeutic armamentarium for the disease.",

        "Abstract":"METHODS: 40 individuals with type 1 diabetes (average age of 44.7 ± 2.5 years) were randomized into four groups: (1) control (placebo), (2) empagliflozin 25 mg daily, (3) metformin 2000 mg daily, and (4) empagliflozin-metformin combination (25 mg and 2000 mg daily, respectively). At inclusion and after 12 weeks of treatment, the blood samples were collected, and the oxidative stress (total antioxidative status (TAS), superoxide dismutase (SOD), glutathione peroxidase (GPx), uric acid, advanced oxidation protein products (AOPP), advanced glycosylation end products ((AGE) and isoprostane), and inflammation (C-reactive protein (CRP) and interleukin-6 (IL-6)) parameters were determined.\nRESULTS: The empagliflozin-metformin combination increased levels of the antioxidants (TAS, SOD, and GPx up to 1.1-fold;  < 0.01), decreased the levels of prooxidants (AOPP and isoprostanes up to 1.2-fold,  < 0.01; AGE up to 1.5-fold,  < 0.01), and decreased inflammatory parameters (up to 1.5-fold, CRP  < 0.01; IL-6  < 0.001). Antioxidative action was associated with the improvement in arterial function (obtained in the previous study) in the empagliflozin-metformin combination group.\nCONCLUSION: Empagliflozin-metformin combination has strong antioxidative and anti-inflammatory capacity, in adults with type 1 diabetes that is greater than that for the individual drugs. Its antioxidative activity at least partially explains the improvement in arterial function. Therefore, it appears that the combination provides the most powerful vascular protection.",

We evaluated the decision-making impact of an artificial intelligence-enabled prognostic test, KidneyIntelX, in the management of DKD by primary care physicians (PCPs).\nSTUDY DESIGN: This was a prospective web-based survey administered among PCPs in the United States.\nMETHODS: We used conjoint analysis with multivariable logit models to estimate PCP preferences. The survey included hypothetical patient profiles with 6 attributes: albuminuria, eGFR, age, blood pressure (BP), hemoglobin A1c (HbA1c), and KidneyIntelX result. Each PCP viewed 8 patient profiles randomly selected from 42 unique profiles having 1 level from each attribute. For each patient, PCPs were asked to indicate whether they would prescribe a sodium-glucose cotransporter-2 (SGLT2) inhibitor, increase angiotensin receptor blocker (ARB) dose, and\/or refer to a nephrologist.\nRESULTS: A total of 401 PCPs completed the survey (response rate, 8.8%). The relative importance of the top 2 attributes for each decision were HbA1c (52%) and KidneyIntelX result (23%) for prescribing SGLT2 inhibitors, BP (62%) and KidneyIntelX result (13%) for increasing ARB dose, and eGFR (42%) and KidneyIntelX result (27%) for nephrologist referral. A high-risk KidneyIntelX result was associated with significantly higher odds of PCPs prescribing SGLT2 inhibitors (odds ratio [OR], 1.64; 95% CI, 1.29-2.08), increasing ARB dose (OR, 1.49; 95% CI, 1.17-1.89), and referring to a nephrologist (OR, 2.47; 95% CI, 1.99-3.08) compared with no test.\nCONCLUSIONS: The KidneyIntelX test had greater relative importance than albuminuria and eGFR to PCPs in making treatment decisions and was second only to eGFR for nephrologist referrals. Because of its significant impact on decision-making, KidneyIntelX has high clinical utility in DKD management.",

        "Abstract":"AIMS: It remains unknown whether the consistently observed increase in haematocrit with sodium-glucose cotransporter 2 inhibitors is caused by diuresis-associated haemoconcentration or increased erythropoiesis. We aimed to investigate the early effect of empagliflozin on erythropoiesis and iron metabolism in patients with heart failure with reduced ejection fraction (HFrEF).\nMETHODS AND RESULTS: The Empire HF was a double-blind, randomized, placebo-controlled trial. Patients with a left ventricular ejection fraction (LVEF) ≤40%, New York Heart Association (NYHA) class I-III symptoms, and on stable guideline-directed HFrEF therapy were randomly assigned (1:1) to empagliflozin or matching placebo once daily for 12 weeks. Exploratory outcomes reflecting changes in erythropoiesis and iron metabolism were analysed. In total, 190 patients were randomized. Baseline characteristics were well-balanced between the groups (age: mean 64 [± 11] years; male: 85%; LVEF: mean 29 [± 8)%; NYHA class II: 78%; type 2 diabetes: 13%; anaemia: 28%; chronic kidney disease: 13%). In this post hoc analysis, erythropoietin was increased with empagliflozin compared to placebo from baseline to 12 weeks (adjusted mean difference 2.6 IU\/L, 95% confidence interval [CI] 0.8-4.4; p = 0.0046). Moreover, hepcidin was reduced (adjusted ratio of change 0.76, 95% CI 0.59-0.97; p = 0.031), with no change observed for erythroferrone (adjusted ratio of change 1.17, 95% CI 0.86-1.60; p = 0.31) compared to placebo. No significant treatment-by-subgroup interactions were observed regarding baseline type 2 diabetes, anaemia, or chronic kidney disease (p  >0.05).\nCONCLUSION: These findings suggest that empagliflozin increases erythropoiesis and augments early iron utilization in patients with HFrEF.
