        "Abstract":"BACKGROUND AND PURPOSE: Data on clinical outcomes for nonvitamin K antagonist oral anticoagulant (NOACs) and warfarin in patients with atrial fibrillation and cancer are limited, and patients with active cancer were excluded from randomized trials. We investigated the effectiveness and safety for NOACs versus warfarin among patients with atrial fibrillation with cancer.\nMETHODS: In this nationwide retrospective cohort study from Taiwan National Health Insurance Research Database, we identified a total of 6274 and 1681 consecutive patients with atrial fibrillation with cancer taking NOACs and warfarin from June 1, 2012, to December 31, 2017, respectively. Propensity score stabilized weighting was used to balance covariates across study groups.\nRESULTS: There were 1031, 1758, 411, and 3074 patients treated with apixaban, dabigatran, edoxaban, and rivaroxaban, respectively. After propensity score stabilized weighting, NOAC was associated with a lower risk of major adverse cardiovascular events (hazard ratio, 0.63 [95% CI, 0.50–0.80]; P=0.0001), major adverse limb events (hazard ratio, 0.41 [95% CI, 0.24–0.70]; P=0.0010), venous thrombosis (hazard ratio, 0.37 [95% CI, 0.23–0.61]; P<0.0001), and major bleeding (hazard ratio, 0.73 [95% CI, 0.56–0.94]; P=0.0171) compared with warfarin. The outcomes were consistent with either direct thrombin inhibitor (dabigatran) or factor Xa inhibitor (apixaban, edoxaban, and rivaroxaban) use, among patients with stroke history, and among patients with different type of cancer and local, regional, or metastatic stage of cancer (P interaction >0.05). When compared with warfarin, NOAC was associated with lower risk of major adverse cardiovascular event, and venous thrombosis in patients aged <75 but not in those aged ≥75 years (P interaction <0.05).\nCONCLUSIONS: Thromboprophylaxis with NOACs rather than warfarin should be considered for the majority of the atrial fibrillation population with cancer.",

Between January 1, 2013, and November 30, 2018, a total of 581 451 patients with atrial fibrillation began rivaroxaban or apixaban treatment and were followed up for 4 years, through November 30, 2018.\nEXPOSURES: Rivaroxaban (n = 227 572) and apixaban (n = 353 879), either standard or reduced dose.\nMAIN OUTCOMES AND MEASURES: The primary outcome was a composite of major ischemic (stroke\/systemic embolism) and hemorrhagic (intracerebral hemorrhage\/other intracranial bleeding\/fatal extracranial bleeding) events. Secondary outcomes were nonfatal extracranial bleeding and total mortality (fatal ischemic\/hemorrhagic event or other death during follow-up). Rates, hazard ratios (HRs), and rate differences (RDs) were adjusted for baseline differences in comorbidity with inverse probability of treatment weighting.\nRESULTS: Study patients (mean age, 77.0 years; 291 966 [50.2%] women; 134 393 [23.1%] receiving reduced dose) had 474 605 person-years of follow-up (median [IQR] of 174 [62-397] days).

The rivaroxaban group had increased risk for both major ischemic events (8.6 vs 7.6 per 1000 person-years; RD, 1.1 [95% CI, 0.5-1.7]; HR, 1.12 [95% CI, 1.04-1.20]) and hemorrhagic events (7.5 vs 5.9 per 1000 person-years; RD, 1.6 [95% CI, 1.1-2.1]; HR, 1.26 [95% CI, 1.16-1.36]), including fatal extracranial bleeding (1.4 vs 1.0 per 1000 person-years; RD, 0.4 [95% CI, 0.2-0.7]; HR, 1.41 [95% CI, 1.18-1.70]). Patients receiving rivaroxaban had increased risk of nonfatal extracranial bleeding (39.7 vs 18.5 per 1000 person-years; RD, 21.1 [95% CI, 20.0-22.3]; HR, 2.07 [95% CI, 1.99-2.15]), fatal ischemic\/hemorrhagic events (4.5 vs 3.3 per 1000 person-years; RD, 1.2 [95% CI, 0.8-1.6]; HR, 1.34 [95% CI, 1.21-1.48]), and total mortality (44.2 vs 41.0 per 1000 person-years; RD, 3.1 [95% CI, 1.8-4.5]; HR, 1.06 [95% CI, 1.02-1.09]).

        "Abstract":"OBJECTIVE: To assess the risk of liver injury hospitalisation in patients with atrial fibrillation (AF) after initiation of direct oral anticoagulants (DOACs) or warfarin and to determine predictors of liver injury hospitalisation in this population.\nMETHODS: We studied 113 717 patients (mean age 70, 39% women) with AF included in the MarketScan Commercial and Medicare Supplemental databases with a first prescription for oral anticoagulation after 4 November 2011, followed through 31 December 2014. Of these, 56 879 initiated warfarin, 17 286 initiated dabigatran, 30 347 initiated rivaroxaban and 9205 initiated apixaban. Liver injury hospitalisation and comorbidities were identified from healthcare claims.\nRESULTS: During a median follow-up of 12 months, 960 hospitalisations with liver injury were identified. Rates of liver injury hospitalisation (per 1000 person-years) by oral anticoagulant were 9.0 (warfarin), 4.0 (dabigatran), 6.6 (rivaroxaban) and 5.6 (apixaban). After multivariable adjustment, liver injury hospitalisation rates were lower in initiators of DOACs compared with warfarin: HR (95% CI) of 0.57 (0.46 to 0.71), 0.88 (0.75 to 1.03) and 0.70 (0.50 to 0.97) for initiators of dabigatran, rivaroxaban, and apixaban, respectively (vs. warfarin). Compared with dabigatran initiators, rivaroxaban initiators had a 56% increased risk of liver injury hospitalisation (HR 1.56, 95% CI 1.22 to 1.99). In addition to type of anticoagulant, prior liver, gallbladder and kidney disease, cancer, anaemia, heart failure and alcoholism significantly predicted liver injury hospitalisation. A predictive model including these variables had adequate discriminative ability (C-statistic 0.67, 95% CI 0.64 to 0.70).\nCONCLUSIONS: Among patients with non-valvular AF, DOACs were associated with lower risk of liver injury hospitalisation compared with warfarin, with dabigatran showing the lowest risk.",

        "Abstract":"Dabigatran, a direct thrombin inhibitor and one of the new class of direct oral anticoagulants, is increasingly used in preference to warfarin because of its efficacy and ease of administration. However, because the drug is cleared by the kidneys, it can accumulate in plasma and increase the risk for bleeding in patients with decreased kidney function. We report a patient with end-stage liver disease who developed life-threatening hemorrhage and acute kidney injury while taking dabigatran, 150mg, twice daily. Although the patient received idarucizumab, an anti-dabigatran antibody fragment used as an antidote, hemostasis could not be achieved. Administration of vitamin K, fresh frozen plasma, desmopressin, octreotide, and pantoprazole did not arrest bleeding or affect coagulation parameters, and it was not possible to establish vascular access for hemodialysis. In patients with end-stage liver disease, who are at increased risk for both bleeding and acute kidney injury, dabigatran should be prescribed cautiously and at decreased dose.",

        "Published":"2016-04-13",
        "Abstract":"BACKGROUND: Prothrombin time (PT) can provide a qualitative assessment of the relative intensity of anticoagulation by rivaroxaban. More than ten types of assay are available for the measurement of PT in clinical settings, but it is not yet fully understood whether their interactions with rivaroxaban are uniform or inconsistent.\nMETHODS: We examined 139 blood samples from patients taking rivaroxaban. We measured PT using five different commercially available assays. We also evaluated the estimated rivaroxaban concentration using a chromogenic anti-factor Xa assay.\nRESULTS: The median estimated concentration of rivaroxaban was 192 ng\/ml (interquartile range 85-284 ng\/ml). The correlation coefficient (r) between PT and the estimated concentrations of rivaroxaban was as follows: Thromborel S, r = 0.768; Thrombocheck PT, r = 0.861; Coagpia PT-N, r = 0.909; Neoplastin Plus, r = 0.882; and Triniclot PT Excel S, r = 0.870. The gradients of the regression plots differed more than fourfold, and the standard deviation of the regression line ranged from 1.001 to 2.980, which tended to be higher for the assays with the higher regression slope gradients.\nCONCLUSION: The estimated concentration of rivaroxaban varied greatly depending on the assay, so the PT measured in patients taking rivaroxaban should be interpreted with caution.",

        "Published":null,
        "Abstract":"BACKGROUND: The ABC (age, biomarker, clinical history)-stroke and ABC-bleeding risk scores incorporate clinical variables and cardiovascular biomarkers to estimate risk of stroke or systemic embolic events and bleeding, respectively, in patients with atrial fibrillation. These scores have been proposed for routine clinical use, but their performance in external cohorts remains uncertain.\nMETHODS: ENGAGE AF-TIMI 48 (Effective Anticoagulation With Factor Xa Next Generation in Atrial Fibrillation-Thrombolysis in Myocardial Infarction 48) was a multinational randomized trial of the oral factor Xa inhibitor edoxaban in patients with atrial fibrillation and a CHADS score ≥2. We performed a nested prospective biomarker study in 8705 patients, analyzing baseline high-sensitivity troponin T (hsTnT), NT-proBNP (N-terminal B-type natriuretic peptide), and growth differentiation factor-15 (GDF-15), as well as in serial samples after 12 months. The ABC-stroke (age, prior stroke\/transient ischemic attack, hsTnT, NT-proBNP) and ABC-bleeding (age, prior bleeding, hemoglobin, hsTnT, and GDF-15) scores were tested. Hazard ratios were adjusted for estimated glomerular filtration rate and the components of the CHADS-VASc and HAS-BLED scores, respectively. Discrimination and reclassification were compared with these established scores.\nRESULTS: Median baseline hsTnT, NT-proBNP, and GDF-15 levels were 13.7 ng\/L (25th-75th percentiles, 9.6-20.4 ng\/L), 811 pg\/mL (386-1436 pg\/mL), and 1661 pg\/mL (1179-2427 pg\/mL), respectively. Elevated hsTnT, NT-proBNP, and GDF-15 were independently associated with higher rates of stroke or systemic embolic events, and elevated hsTnT and GDF-15 were independently associated with higher rates of major bleeding ( P<0.001 for each). The ABC-stroke and ABC-bleeding scores were well calibrated and yielded higher c indexes than the CHADS-VASc score for stroke or systemic embolic events (0.67 [95% CI, 0.65-0.70] versus 0.59 [95% CI, 0.57-0.62]; P<0.001) and HAS-BLED score for major bleeding (0.69 [95% CI, 0.66-0.71] versus 0.62 [95% CI, 0.60-0.64]; P<0.001), respectively. The ABC-stroke and ABC-bleeding scores stratified patients within CHADS-VASc and HAS-BLED risk categories ( P<0.001 for both). Patients with ABC-bleeding scores predicting a high 1-year risk of bleeding (>2%) derived greater benefit from treatment with edoxaban compared with warfarin.\nCONCLUSIONS: The ABC-stroke and ABC-bleeding scores evaluated in this anticoagulated clinical trial cohort were well calibrated and outperformed the CHADS-VASc and HAS-BLED scores, respectively. These scores may help identify patients most likely to derive a benefit from treatment with non-vitamin K antagonist oral anticoagulants.\nCLINICAL TRIAL REGISTRATION: URL: https:\/\/www.clinicaltrials.gov .

There are limited data observing outcomes associated with resuming DOACs following a GIB.\nOBJECTIVE: The purpose of this study was to evaluate practice patterns and clinical outcomes of patients admitted with an index GIB while receiving DOAC therapy.\nMETHODS: This retrospective, single-system study included adult patients receiving DOAC therapy prior to admission and hospitalized with an index GIB between January 1, 2013, and October 31, 2018. Patient exclusion criteria were a history of immune thrombocytopenia purpura or inflammatory bowel disease; discharge to hospice; leaving against medical advice; or death during hospitalization. The primary objective was 90-day readmission for a recurrent GIB.\nRESULTS: There were 57 patients included for analysis; 37 patients had DOAC therapy held >7 days, 18 patients resumed DOAC therapy within 7 days, and 2 patients switched to warfarin. The majority of patients received rivaroxaban (59.6%) prior to admission for atrial fibrillation (71.9%), were admitted with a major GIB (66.7%), and required a blood transfusion (61.4%). The rates of recurrent GIB were 2.5% (n = 1) and 5.6% (n = 1) for those who had their DOAC held and resumed, respectively ( = 0.83).

A primary endpoint of MACCE and a co-primary endpoint of major bleeding by ISTH criteria were considered at 12 months.\nRESULTS: A total of 1249 patients (81.1 ± 4.2 years, 33.1% women, 66.6% ACS, 30.6% complex PCI) were included. Triple antithrombotic therapy (TAT) was prescribed in 81.7% and dual antithrombotic therapy (DAT) in 18.3%.

        "Abstract":"INTRODUCTION: Atrial fibrillation (AF) is the most common cardiac arrhythmia and increases the risk of ischemic stroke 4 to 5-fold. The first choice of anticoagulant therapy (AT) is the vitamin K antagonist (VKA). Contraindication to VKA or poor control of the International Normalized Ratio leads to the administration of direct-acting oral anticoagulants. There is a trend toward inadequate AT in nonvalvular AF (NVAF) patients.\nAIM: To evaluate the impact of the implementation of a decision support tool linked to the digital clinical history on the adequacy of AT, the incidence of complications, and the mortality in patients with NVAF in primary care centers (PCCs) of the Catalan Institute of Health (ICS).\nMETHODS AND ANALYSIS: Randomized clinical trial in 287 PCCs, formed by 2 groups (intervention and control).\nPOPULATION: patients controlled in PCCs, diagnosed with NVAF 1 year before the implementation of the decision support tool and with VKA treatment over a minimum of 1 year. A simple randomization method will be performed at a sector level. The decision support tool will be available for 1 year. The time in therapeutic range (TTR) will be available in the digital clinical history only to professionals of the intervention group. The information system for primary care research development database will be used for the data extraction. Statistical analysis will be done at 3 time points: before the implementation of the tool, at 1 year, and at 2 years after the beginning of the intervention. Multilevel (patient and professional levels) logistic regression models will be used to estimate the effect of the intervention.\nETHICS AND DISSEMINATION: This study protocol was approved by the Ethical Committee of Clinical Investigation of the Institut Universitari d'Investigació en Atenció Primària Jordi Gol (code P17\/091).

        "Abstract":"Advances in cancer therapy have led to a significant improvement of survival in most types of malignancies over the past few decades. As a result, there is a growing population of cancer survivors, expected to reach 18 million people in 2030 in the US and a similar number in Europe. Interestingly, cancer survivor studies have shown that although about half of these patients eventually die of cancer, one third of them actually die of cardiovascular disease. Arrhythmias represent a significant part of cardiovascular complications and atrial fibrillation is the main arrhythmia occurring in cancer patients.Antithrombotic therapy is a challenge: the optimal international normalized ratio (INR) level in patients on therapy with vitamin K antagonists is achieved in only 12% of them; in these patients, direct oral anticoagulants seem to be effective and safe for the prevention of stroke and systemic embolic events compared to warfarin and have similar risk of major bleeding. Among the trials, ENGAGE AF-TIMI 48 provides more data on the efficacy and safety of edoxaban in cancer patients.",

        "Abstract":"BACKGROUND: We aimed to assess the prevalence of ischemic brain lesions detected by magnetic resonance imaging and their association with cognitive function 3 months after first-time ablation using continuous oral anticoagulation in patients with paroxysmal atrial fibrillation (AF).\nMETHODS: We performed a prespecified analysis of the AXAFA-AFNET 5 trial (Anticoagulation Using the Direct Factor Xa Inhibitor Apixaban During Atrial Fibrillation Catheter Ablation: Comparison to Vitamin K Antagonist Therapy), which randomized 674 patients with AF 1:1 to uninterrupted apixaban or vitamin K antagonist therapy before first-time ablation. Brain magnetic resonance imaging using fluid-attenuated inversion recovery and high-resolution diffusion-weighted imaging was obtained within 3 to 48 hours after AF ablation in all eligible patients enrolled in 25 study centers in Europe and the United States. Patients underwent cognitive assessment 3 to 6 weeks before ablation and 3 months after ablation using the Montreal Cognitive Assessment (MoCA).\nRESULTS: In 84 (26.1%) of 321 patients with analyzable magnetic resonance imaging, high-resolution diffusion-weighted imaging detected at least 1 acute brain lesion, including 44 (27.2%) patients treated with apixaban and 40 (24.8%) patients treated with vitamin K antagonist (=0.675). Median MoCA score was similar in patients with or without acute brain lesions at 3 months after ablation (28 [interquartile range (IQR), 26-29] versus 28 [IQR, 26-29]; =0.948). Cerebral chronic white matter damage (defined as Wahlund score ≥4 points) detected by fluid-attenuated inversion recovery was present in 130 (40.5%) patients and associated with lower median MoCA scores before ablation (27 [IQR, 24-28] versus 27 [IQR, 25-29]; =0.026) and 3 months after ablation (27 [IQR, 25-29] versus 28 [IQR, 26-29]; =0.011). This association was no longer significant when adjusted for age and sex. Age was associated with lower MoCA scores before ablation (relative risk, 1.02 per 10 years [95% CI, 1.01-1.03]) and 3 months after ablation (relative risk, 1.02 per 10 years [95% CI, 1.01-1.03]).\nCONCLUSIONS: Chronic white matter damage as well as acute ischemic lesions detected by brain magnetic resonance imaging were found frequently after first-time ablation for paroxysmal AF using uninterrupted oral anticoagulation. Acute ischemic brain lesions detected by high-resolution diffusion-weighted imaging were not associated with cognitive function at 3 months after ablation. Lower MoCA scores before and after ablation were associated only with older age, highlighting the safety of AF ablation on uninterrupted oral anticoagulation.\nREGISTRATION: URL: https:\/\/www.\nCLINICALTRIALS: gov; Unique identifier: NCT02227550.",

Our aim was to evaluate in a real-life setting the characteristics and management of patients with nonvalvular atrial fibrillation to whom Italian doctors decided to prescribe rivaroxaban.\nMETHODS: Between January and February 2014, a group of 95 physicians collected aggregate retrospective data, through an online questionnaire, on 1127 patients with nonvalvular atrial fibrillation receiving rivaroxaban. Descriptive statistics were performed based on the data collected.\nRESULTS: Mean age of patients was 76 years; 20% of patients suffered a previous transient ischemic attack and 16% a previous stroke; 16% was anemic or at risk of bleeding. Over 40% of patients was unable to have a good control of the previous antithrombotic therapy, 22% was also taking antiplatelet drugs or nonsteroidal anti-inflammatory drugs, and 85% had been on a previous stroke prevention therapy; among the latter the main causes for switching to rivaroxaban were patient choice (30%), problems in maintaining the prothromin time-international normalized ratio (PT-INR) within the therapeutic range (27%), and logistic problems in attending the PT-INR follow-up visits (20%).

        "Abstract":"PURPOSE: Compliance with anticoagulation treatment for atrial fibrillation is highly variable. Smartphone electrocardiograms that allow patients to have greater insight into their arrhythmia burden may improve anticoagulant compliance.\nMETHODS: Patients were enrolled if they had atrial fibrillation with a CHADS-VASc score of 2 or more, were eligible for anticoagulation and had a smartphone. Participants were randomly assigned to receive a smartphone electrocardiogram (AliveCor Kardia) to record their electrocardiograms 5 times\/week or to the control group. All patients received 6 months of anticoagulant (apixaban) dispensed as 1-month pre-loaded pill boxes.\nRESULTS: A total of 100 patients were enrolled from July 2017 to August 2019, but 5 patients in the monitor arm and 1 in the control arm withdrew prematurely. The monitor and control groups did not differ in age, gender, CHADS-VASc score, or comorbidities. Median medication compliance was 99.7%, with nonsignificantly greater compliance in the monitor group (100%) than in the control group (99.7%) (p-value = 0.247). There was also no significant difference between missing any dose and use\/nonuse of the smartphone monitor (48.9% vs. 55.1%; p-value = 0.692). Mean monitor compliance was 86.8% ± 14.0% with an average of 4.34 recorded electrocardiograms per week. Monitor group patients with perfect medication compliance had significantly higher monitor compliance than those patients who missed doses (median 95.3% vs 86.7%; p-value = 0.02).\nCONCLUSIONS: In a study population with higher-than-expected medication compliance, the use of smartphone electrocardiogram did not demonstrate an improvement in medication compliance as compared to usual care. Greater monitor compliance was associated with greater medication compliance.\nCLINICAL TRIAL REGISTRATION: BOAT-OAR ClinicalTrials.gov number, NCT03515083.",

        "Published":"2021-09-06",
        "Abstract":"BACKGROUND: Direct oral anticoagulants (DOACs) are currently recommended as first-line or (after vitamin K antagonists) second-line therapy for preventing stroke and systemic embolism in patients with non-valvular atrial fibrillation. In patients aged 80 years and over, however, the fear of DOAC-associated bleeding and the complexity of DOAC dosing regimes may prompt physicians to prescribe inappropriate dose levels.\nOBJECTIVE: The objective of this study was to determine compliance with French and European guidelines of doses of three DOACs (apixaban, dabigatran and rivaroxaban) prescribed to patients aged over 80 years in an indication of non-valvular atrial fibrillation, and to identify factors associated with poor compliance.\nMETHODS: We performed a retrospective single-centre study of patients aged over 80 years routinely treated with a DOAC (apixaban, dabigatran or rivaroxaban) for non-valvular atrial fibrillation at Valenciennes General Hospital (Valenciennes, France) between 1 January, 2016 and 31 December, 2017. We determined compliance with French and European guidelines of DOAC doses as a function of each patient's clinical and laboratory parameters, and thus classified the regime as being appropriately dosed, overdosed or underdosed.\nRESULTS: A total of 703 patients (371 taking apixaban, 92 taking dabigatran and 240 taking rivaroxaban) were included in the study. We found that 274 patients (39%) had been prescribed an inappropriate DOAC regime, with underdosing in 241 cases (34%) and overdosing in 33 cases (5%). Underdosing mainly concerned the two most widely prescribed DOACs, i.e. apixaban (39% of all apixaban prescriptions were underdosed) and rivaroxaban (40%). Concomitant treatment with an antidepressant was associated with underdosing of rivaroxaban or apixaban (p = 0.0339). In contrast, initial management in a neurology department was associated with appropriate dosing (p = 0.000146) for both these DOACs.\nCONCLUSIONS: Among patients with non-valvular atrial fibrillation aged 80 years and over, about 40% of DOAC prescriptions feature inappropriate dose levels. It might be possible to reduce inappropriate dosing by raising awareness among hospital-based and private-practice prescribers, providing prescription support tools for DOACs, and performing medication reconciliations and reviews at hospital and in private practice.",

The RE-CIRCUIT study showed significantly fewer major bleeding events in the dabigatran vs. warfarin treatment group. Unfractionated heparin was administered during the procedure to maintain ACT >300 s.\nMETHODS AND RESULTS: Patients were randomly assigned to dabigatran 150 mg bid or international normalized ratio-adjusted warfarin. Ablation was performed with uninterrupted anticoagulation and continued for 8 weeks after the procedure. Heparin was administered after placement of femoral sheaths before or immediately after transseptal puncture. Ablation was performed in 635 patients (dabigatran, 317; warfarin, 318); data were available from 396 patients administered heparin (dabigatran, 191; warfarin, 205). Most frequent time window from last dose of study drug to septal puncture was 0 to <4 h in the dabigatran (41.3%) and 16 to <24 h in the warfarin arms (44.7%). Overall mean (standard deviation) heparin dose was similar between the dabigatran and warfarin groups [12 402 (10 721) vs. 11 910 (8359) IU, respectively]. Heparin dosing requirement to reach therapeutic ACT was lowest when time from last dose of dabigatran to septal puncture was 0 to <4 h.\nCONCLUSION: Patients treated with dabigatran required a similar amount of unfractionated heparin as those treated with warfarin to achieve an ACT of >300 s during ablation.

During long-term anticoagulant therapy, delayed or missed doses are common. This study aimed to explore appropriate remedial dosing regimens for non-adherent rivaroxaban-treated patients.\nMETHODS: Monte Carlo simulation based on a previously established rivaroxaban population pharmacokinetic\/pharmacodynamic (PK\/PD) model for patients with NVAF was employed to design remedial dosing regimens. The proposed regimens were compared with remedial strategies in the European Heart Rhythm Association (EHRA) guide by assessing deviation time in terms of drug concentration, factor Xa activity, and prothrombin time.\nRESULTS: The proposed remedial dosing regimens were dependent on delay duration. The missed dose should be taken immediately when the delay does not exceed 6 h; a half dose is advisable when the delay is between 6 and 20 h. A missed dose should be skipped if less than 4 h remains before the next dose. The proposed regimens resulted in shorter deviation time than that of the EHRA guide.\nCONCLUSION: PK\/PD modeling and simulation provide valid evidence on the remedial dosing regimen of rivaroxaban, which could help to minimize the risk of bleeding and thromboembolism.",

        "Abstract":"OBJECTIVES: Use of anticoagulant and antiplatelet medications (AAMs) is increasing significantly with our growing population of older adults. AAMs worsen outcomes in trauma patients. Our goal was to improve collaboration between trauma and outpatient providers and to improve safety in making decisions on anticoagulant and antiplatelet medications(AAMs) after injuries.\nDESIGN: A risk management initiative.\nSETTING AND PARTICIPANTS: Patients that suffered traumatic injury while on anticoagulation or antiplatelets medications at a level I university trauma center.\nMETHODS: IRB approval was obtained to review records for medications, demographics, mechanism and type of injury, and indication for preinjury AAM use. Inpatient trauma team providers contacted the primary prescriber. A collaborative decision was made regarding AAM plans.\nRESULTS: One hundred and five patients, mean age 79 years, were followed. The three most common AAMs were warfarin (69 patients), clopidogrel (24), and Factor Xa inhibitors (16). Atrial fibrillation was the most common indication for AAMs (70 patients), venous thrombosis (14) and TIA\/CVA (11). Falls were the most frequent injury mechanism, 79.4%. Soft tissue hematomas (27.4%), TBI (16%), and pelvic fractures (12.3%) were the most common injuries. In 56.6% AAMs were held until follow-up, 31.1% had AAMs resumed at discharge, and AAMs were held indefinitely in 12.3%. Patients discharged to home versus facility (37 vs 18% p<0.05), <75 years of age (47 vs 27% p<0.05) were more likely to have AAMs resumed at discharge. Patients who suffered falls versus MVC mechanism were less likely to have AAMs resumed at discharge (28 vs 82% p<0.05). CHA2DS2-VASc scores were similar between decision groups.\nCONCLUSIONS AND IMPLICATIONS: This is the first description of mandatory communication between trauma and outpatient providers to guide decision making on AAMs after injury. Efforts should be made to determine if this mitigates risk by following patients longterm. This communication should become standard for a population that is often elderly, frail, and at risk of repeat injuries.",

The anticoagulation status of patients receiving warfarin or rivaroxaban has been studied. In this study, we aimed to evaluate the effect of dabigatran and warfarin on preventing thrombin generation (TG).\nMETHODS: This retrospective study enrolled 237 nonvalvular atrial fibrillation (NVAF) subjects treated with 110 mg dabigatran etexilate twice daily and 224 NVAF patients received adjusted-dose warfarin (international normalized ratio [INR] of 2 to 3)). Coagulation assays, prothrombin fragment 1  +  2 (F), calibrated automated thrombogram, and thrombin-antithrombin complex (TAT) were detected at the steady state.\nRESULTS: Activated partial thromboplastin time (APTT), antithrombin III activity, fibrinogen, and lag time showed no difference between the two groups. Compared to the dabigatran group, prothrombin time and INR values were higher in the warfarin group (all  < .001). Thrombin time, endogenous thrombin potential, peak TG (C), F, and TAT were lower in the warfarin group. The inhibition of TG was still stronger in the warfarin group when the patients were divided into subgroups.\nCONCLUSION: Conventional coagulation assays are suboptimal for assessing the coagulation status of dabigatran. TG could be used as supplementary assays to evaluate the anticoagulation effect of oral anticoagulants. Our results suggest that warfarin may inhibit TG more aggressively than dabigatran in patients regardless of age and kidney function.",

When compared, the PT and complication rate in group 1 with the control group C min,ss of rivaroxaban were practically the same (p>0.05 for all). Conclusions In patients ≥80 years with NAF, the use of rivaroxaban in combination with verapamil may not be safe and can lead to CRNM bleeding.",

A retrospective chart review of 90 patients, utilizing an electronic health record, and a longterm care pharmacy's dispensing record. Patient electronic health records were reviewed to collect the following data: prescribed DOAC, dose, therapy duration, diagnosis, age, height, weight, and serum creatinine. This information was used to determine the FDA-recommended DOAC dose and recommended duration, which was compared with the prescribed dose and duration.  The rate of incorrect DOAC doses, defined as a discrepancy from the FDA-recommended dose, based on patient characteristics.  Two chains of long-term care facilities in Michigan, Ohio, North Carolina, Tennessee, and Virginia serviced by a long-term care pharmacy. PATIENTS: Patients prescribed one of three targeted DOACs (apixaban, rivaroxaban, or dabigatran) between August and October 2019. Patients had to be a resident within two long-term care chains.  Thirty-three out of 90 residents were treated with an incorrect DOAC dose. This broke down into 20% of patients on a dose that was too low and 17% of patients on a dose that was too high.  The results of the study identify the need for pharmacists to closely review the dosing of DOACs and recommend therapeutic changes based on treatment guidelines.",

Additional research is needed to evaluate the effects of edoxaban in routine clinical practice. Therefore, the Edoxaban Treatment in routine cliNical prActice (ETNA) program is being conducted to provide routine clinical care data on characteristics and outcomes in patients with AF or VTE receiving edoxaban.\nMETHODS: The Global ETNA program integrates prospectively collected data from edoxaban patients in regional ETNA noninterventional studies across Europe, Japan, and East and Southeast Asia into indication-specific databases for AF and VTE. Targeted enrollment is >31 000 patients (AF >26 000; VTE >4500), with a follow-up of 2 years for AF and 1 year for VTE. Data integration will be possible using consistent terminology, parameter definitions, and data collection across the regional noninterventional studies. Safety and effectiveness data will be assessed. Crude rates of outcomes including bleeding and thromboembolic events will be reported.\nRESULTS: Globally, enrollment began in early 2015 and is ongoing.\nCONCLUSIONS: Global ETNA will generate the largest integrated prospective repository of routine clinical care data for a single NOAC in patients with AF or VTE.

In fact, even if new oral anticoagulation agents (NOACs) have a predictable effect without need for regular monitoring, dose-adjustments should be performed according to the summary of product information and international guidelines. We employed the Italian Medicines Agency monitoring registries comprising data on a nationwide cohort of patients with AF treated with NOACs from 2013 to 2018. Logistic regression analysis was used to evaluate the determinants of dosage choice. During the reference period, treatment was commenced for 866,539 patients. Forty-five percent of the first prescriptions were dispensed at a reduced dose (dabigatran 60.3%, edoxaban 45.2%, apixaban 40.9%, rivaroxaban 37.4%). The prescription of reduced dose was associated with older age, renal disease, bleeding risk and the concomitant use of drugs predisposing to bleeding, but not with CHADS-VASc and HAS-BLED. A relative reduction of the proportion of patients treated with low dosages was evident overtime for dabigatran and rivaroxaban; whereas prescription of low dose apixaban and edoxaban increased progressively among elderly patients. Evidence based on real-world data shows a high frequency of low dose prescriptions of NOACs in AF patients. Except for older age, renal disease, bleeding risk and the concomitant use of drugs predisposing to bleeding, other factors that may determine the choice of reduced dose could not be ascertained. There may be potential under-treatment of AF patients, but further evaluation is warranted.",

Lab monitoring puts patients at risk of COVID-19 exposure and diverts medical resources away from health care systems. Direct oral anticoagulants (DOACs) do not require routine therapeutic monitoring and are indicated first line for nonvalvular atrial fibrillation (NVAF) stroke prevention and venous thromboembolism (VTE) prevention\/treatment.\nOBJECTIVE: The purpose of the study was to determine the proportion of patients who qualify for DOACs and assess for predictors of qualification.\nMETHODS: This cross-sectional study investigated patients on warfarin managed by Michigan Medicine Anticoagulation Service. Direct oral anticoagulant eligibility criteria were established using apixaban, dabigatran, and rivaroxaban package inserts. Patient eligibility was determined through chart review. The primary outcome was the proportion of patients who qualify for DOACs based on clinical factors. Predictors of DOAC qualification were assessed.\nRESULTS: This study included 3205 patients and found 51.8% ( = 1661) of patients qualified for DOACs. Qualifying patients were older (71.9 vs 59.4 years,  < 0.0001) with a higher CHADS VASc (3.7 vs 3.4,  < 0.0007). The primary disqualifying factor was extreme weight, high and low. Accounting for a patient's sex and referral source, age > 65 (odds ratio [OR] = 1.9,  < 0.0001) and NVAF indication (OR = 5.6,  < 0.0001) were significant predictors for DOAC qualification.\nCONCLUSION AND RELEVANCE: Approximately 52% of patients on warfarin were eligible for DOACs. This presents an opportunity to reduce patient exposure to health care settings and health care utilization in the setting of COVID-19. Increased costs of DOACs need to be assessed.",

Subclinical AF is common and associated with an increased risk of stroke; however, the risk of stroke with subclinical AF is lower than for clinical AF, and very few patients with subclinical AF alone have been included in large AF anticoagulation trials. The net benefit of anticoagulation in patients with subclinical AF is unknown.\nDESIGN: ARTESiA is a prospective, multicenter, double-blind, randomized controlled trial, recruiting patients with subclinical AF detected by an implanted pacemaker, defibrillator, or cardiac monitor, and who have additional risk factors for stroke. Patients with clinical AF documented by surface electrocardiogram will be excluded from the study. Participants will be randomized to receive either apixaban (according to standard AF dosing) or aspirin 81mg daily. The primary outcome is the composite of stroke, transient ischemic attack with diffusion-weighted magnetic resonance imaging evidence of cerebral infarction, and systemic embolism. Approximately 4,000 patients will be enrolled from around 230 clinical sites, with an anticipated mean follow-up of 36months until 248 adjudicated primary outcome events have occurred.\nSUMMARY: ARTESiA will determine whether oral anticoagulation therapy with apixaban compared with aspirin reduces the risk of stroke or systemic embolism in patients with subclinical AF and additional risk factors.",

The present study brings together the opinions and daily routine clinical practices of physicians regarding the use of NOACs in the geriatric age group for the treatment of venous thromboembolic diseases.\nMATERIALS AND METHODS: The study accessed 274 physicians (197 attending, 70 resident and seven primary care physicians) with various specialties and academic positions through face-to-face interviews or e-mails, and asked them to complete a questionnaire form prepared for NOAC use on a voluntary basis between 1 May and 31 December 2019.\nRESULT: It was found that physicians preferred NOACs mostly for patients contraindicated for the regular use of low-molecular-weight heparins and warfarin (n: 264, 96%), and with an unbalanced INR level (n: 230, 87%). The use of NOACs was found to be higher in the geriatric age group than other anticoagulants due to the easy dose adjustment, the extended monitoring intervals and the low risk of bleeding. Among the physicians, neither the specialty nor a higher number of occupational working years affected the preference for NOACs or other anticoagulants.\nCONCLUSIONS: Our study has demonstrated that physicians consider NOACs to be a good treatment option in terms of efficacy and reliability for the treatment of thromboembolic diseases in the geriatric age group, who may have treatment compliance difficulties. It was found also that they plan treatment considering the benefit-to-harm ratio and the bleeding-ischemic event balance.",

        "Abstract":"Aim To study efficacy and safety of a triple antithrombotic therapy with direct oral anticoagulants (DOAC) versus warfarin in patients with atrial fibrillation after acute coronary syndrome, for 12 months following discharge from the hospital.Materials and methods This single-site cohort, prospective, observational study performed at the Regional Vascular Center 2 of the N.A. Semashko Nizhniy Novgorod Regional Clinical Hospital included 402 patients. It was possible to maintain contacts with 206 patients for 12 months. These patients were divided into two groups, the DOAC treatment (n=105) and the warfarin treatment (n=101) as a part of triple antithrombotic therapy upon discharge. Clinical observation was performed at 1, 3, 6, and 12 months after the discharge by structured telephone interview. Predetermined efficacy endpoints included cardiovascular death, myocardial infarction, stent thrombosis, and ischemic stroke. Safety endpoints included bleeding defined as small, medium (clinically significant), and major in accordance with the TIMI classification.Results At 12 months of follow-up, 80 patients (76.19%) continued taking DOAC and 39 patients (38.61%, p&lt;0.001) continued taking warfarin; in this process, only 25 patients (24.75%) monitored their INR on a regular basis. With a regular INR monitoring and TTR &gt;70%, death rate did not differ in the warfarin and the DOAC treatment groups. However, there was a difference in reaching the composite efficacy endpoint (p=0.048): ischemic events occurred statistically significantly more frequently in the warfarin treatment group than in the DOAC treatment group.Conclusions In 12 months after discharge from the hospital, compliance with the DOAC treatment as a part of the antithrombotic therapy was significantly higher than compliance with the warfarin treatment. The triple antithrombotic therapy with DOAC was safer than the warfarin treatment by the number of hemorrhagic complications and more effective in prevention of ischemic events, primarily due to no need for monitoring of lab test values.",

At the very beginning of symptoms, anti-inflammatory drugs, vitamin D, and adjuvant dietary supplements (quercetin, vitamin C, zinc, and vitamin K2) were administered, followed by dexamethasone and antibiotic therapy, according to the evolving clinical conditions. Gastroprotection with omeprazole was added.

However, the relative effectiveness and safety of different oral anticoagulants for diabetic patients with non-valvular AF remain unclear. We aimed to compare thromboembolic events, bleeding and mortality in diabetic AF patients treated with rivaroxaban, dabigatran and warfarin.\nMETHODS AND RESULTS: Diabetic AF patients taking dabigatran ( = 322), rivaroxaban ( = 320) or warfarin ( = 1,899) were identified from the nationwide diabetes pay-for-performance program ( = 814,465) in Taiwan. Outcomes and comorbidities were evaluated by linking with Taiwan National Health Insurance Research Database. Propensity score weighting method was used to balance covariates across study groups. Patients were followed up until the first occurrence of any study outcome or the study end date. Compared with warfarin, dabigatran significantly decreased the risk of all-cause mortality (hazard ratio [HR] = 0.348, 95% confidence interval [CI] = 0.157-0.771) and gastrointestinal bleeding (HR = 0.558, 95% CI = 0.327-0.955). Relative effectiveness and safety outcomes between rivaroxaban and warfarin were comparable. Compared with rivaroxaban, dabigatran significantly decreased the risk of all-cause mortality (HR = 0.310, 95% CI = 0.121-0.798) and was associated with a borderline reduced risk for composite safety end points (HR = 0.670, 95% CI = 0.421-1.067).\nCONCLUSION: In diabetic AF patients, dabigatran and rivaroxaban showed a superior or non-inferior effectiveness and safety profile compared with warfarin.

        "Abstract":"BACKGROUND: Trends and clinical factors associated with prescribing choices for oral P2Y12 inhibitors (P2Y12-I) remain unknown for patients on chronic dialysis, i.e., with end-stage renal disease (ESRD).\nMETHODS: From 2011-2014 U.S. Renal Data System registry, we identified 36,542 ESRD patients who received new prescriptions for P2Y12-I (median age 64.0 years and 54% males). Of the cohort, 93% were receiving hemodialysis and 7% on peritoneal dialysis. We analyzed trends and investigated clinical factors associated with specific P2Y12-I prescribed.\nRESULTS: Clopidogrel was prescribed for 95%, prasugrel for 3%, and ticagrelor for 2%. Clopidogrel was favored for those ≥75 years (18% of cohort). Compared to Caucasians, African Americans (36% of cohort) and Hispanics (19% of cohort) were less likely to receive prasugrel and ticagrelor (P<0.05). Patients receiving hemodialysis versus peritoneal dialysis were less likely to receive prasugrel over clopidogrel, adjusted odds ratio (aOR) 0.67 (0.55-0.82). Each additional year of dialysis decreased the odds of receiving prasugrel over clopidogrel, aOR 0.91 (0.85-0.98). History of atrial fibrillation reduced the odds of receiving ticagrelor or prasugrel over clopidogrel, aOR 0.69 (0.54-0.89) and 0.73 (0.60-0.89), respectively. Concomitant oral anticoagulant use was not associated with choice of P2Y12-I. Occurrence of non-ST segment elevation myocardial infarction or percutaneous coronary intervention within the 6-month period prior to the index date favored ticagrelor over prasugrel, aOR 1.31 (1.06-1.62) and 1.29 (1.01-1.66), respectively. However, prescribing trends favoring ticagrelor over prasugrel were not observed for deployment of drug-eluting, or multiple coronary stents.\nCONCLUSION: Between 2011 and 2014, clopidogrel remained the most common P2Y12-I whereas ticagrelor and prasugrel remained underutilized in ESRD patients. Prescribing practices for these drugs were based upon clinically approved indication for their use in the general population as well as perceived complexity of an ESRD patient including demographics, dialysis-related factors and comorbidities. Comparative effectiveness studies involving ESRD patients are needed to prove that ticagrelor and prasugrel are just as safe and effective as clopidogrel before clinicians can make informed decisions for choice of P2Y12-I in this patient population.",

        "Published":"2020-11-12",
        "Abstract":"Direct oral anticoagulants, such as apixaban and rivaroxaban, are important for the treatment and prophylaxis of venous thromboembolism and to reduce the risk of stroke and systemic embolism in patients with nonvalvular atrial fibrillation. Because apixaban and rivaroxaban are predominantly eliminated by cytochrome P450 (CYP) 3A and P-glycoprotein (P-gp), concomitant use of combined P-gp and strong CYP3A4 inhibitors and inducers should be avoided. Physiologically-based pharmacokinetic models for apixaban and rivaroxaban were developed to estimate the net effect of CYP3A induction, P-gp inhibition, and P-gp induction by rifampicin. The disposition of rivaroxaban is more complex compared with apixaban because both hepatic and renal P-gp is considered to contribute to rivaroxaban elimination. Furthermore, organic anion transporter-3, a renal uptake transporter, may also contribute the elimination of rivaroxaban from systemic circulation. The models were verified with observed clinical drug-drug interactions with CYP3A and P-gp inhibitors. With the developed models, the predicted area under the concentration time curve and maximum concentration ratios were 0.43 and 0.48, respectively, for apixaban, and 0.50-0.52 and 0.72-0.73, respectively, for rivaroxaban when coadministered with 600 mg multiple doses of rifampicin and that were very close to observed data. The impact of each of the elimination pathways was assessed for rivaroxaban, and inhibition of CYP3A led to a larger impact over intestinal and hepatic P-gp. Inhibition of renal organic anion transporter-3 or P-gp led to an overall modest interaction. The developed apixaban and rivaroxaban models can be further applied to the investigation of interactions with other P-gp and\/or CYP3A4 inhibitors and inducers.",

        "Abstract":"INTRODUCTION: Some patients with atrial fibrillation (AF) develop left atrial appendage thrombus (LAAT) despite receiving anticoagulant treatment. Different scores were proposed to evaluate thromboembolic risk in patients with AF. Risk stratification according to sex is common in clinical practice.\nOBJECTIVE: We aimed to identify predictors of LAAT separately in men and women treated with dabigatran or rivaroxaban.\nPATIENTS AND METHODS: This retrospective study included 1256 patients (479 women [38.1%]) with AF who underwent transesophageal echocardiography before electrical cardioversion or catheter ablation, between January 2013 and December 2019, and received dabigatran or rivaroxaban for at least 3 weeks.\nRESULTS: Multivariable logistic regression analysis revealed nonparoxysmal AF to predict LAAT in women (odds ratio [OR], 9.70; P = 0.002). In men, the predictors were heart failure (OR, 4.14; P = 0.001), diabetes (OR, 2.64; P = 0.002), nonparoxysmal AF (OR, 5.61; P = 0.02), and estimated glomerular filtration rate below 60 ml\/min\/1.73 m2 (OR, 2.77; P = 0.01). In the receiver operating characteristic curve analysis, the CHA2DS2‑VASc-RAF score had the highest value for predicting LAAT in women (area under the curve [AUC] = 0.786). In men, CHA2DS2‑VASc-RAF, CHA2DS2, CHA2DS2‑VASc, and R2CHADS2 had sufficient predictive value (AUC = 0.786, 0.726, 0.734, and 0.780, respectively).\nCONCLUSIONS: The predictors of LAAT differ between men and women treated with dabigatran or rivaroxaban. In women, the CHA2DS2‑VASc‑RAF score had the highest predictive value, while in men all the scores had equally sufficient predictive value.",

        "Abstract":"OBJECTIVES: Current international guidelines advocate the application of bleeding risk scores only to identify modifiable risk factors, but not to withhold treatment in patients at high risk of bleeding. VTE-BLEED (ActiVe cancer, male with uncontrolled hyperTension, anaEmia, history of BLeeding, agE and rEnal Dysfunction) is a simple bleeding risk score that predicts major bleeding (MB) in patients with venous thromboembolism, but has never been evaluated in patients with atrial fibrillation (AF). We sought to evaluate VTE-BLEED in patients with AF included in the Randomised Evaluation of Long-term anticoagulant therapY (RE-LY) trial, to assess whether score classes (high vs low bleeding risk) interact with the tested dabigatran doses (150 vs 110 mg twice daily), and to investigate whether dose reductions based on this interaction might help to lower the incidence of the composite outcome MB, stroke\/systemic embolism or death.\nMETHODS: The score was calculated in the safety population of RE-LY (n=18 040) and recalibrated for AF (AF-adapted VTE-BLEED or AF-BLEED). HRs were calculated to evaluate the score's predictive accuracy for MB. The risk ratios (RRs) for the composite outcome comparing dabigatran 150 and 110 mg twice daily were calculated for the high-risk group.\nRESULTS: AF-BLEED classified 3534 patients (19.6%) at high bleeding risk, characterised by a 2.9-fold to 3.4-fold higher risk of bleeding than low bleeding risk patients, across the treatment arms. High bleeding risk patients randomised to 110 mg twice daily had a lower incidence of the composite outcome than those randomised to 150 mg twice daily, for an RR of 0.52 (95% CI 0.35 to 0.78). Compared with the label criteria for dose reduction, AF-BLEED identified an additional 11% of patients who might have benefited from dose reduction.\nCONCLUSIONS: AF-BLEED identified patients with AF at high risk of bleeding. Our findings raise the hypothesis that dabigatran 110 mg twice daily might be considered in patients classified as high risk according to the AF-BLEED score. This study provides a basis for future studies to explore safe dose reductions of direct oral anticoagulants in selected patient groups based on bleeding scores.",

This case series, the first of its kind, reports on the successful concurrent use of the direct-acting oral anticoagulant dabigatran and antiretroviral therapy.\nMETHODS: This series involved 14 patients requiring anticoagulation for management of atrial fibrillation, who were either unable or unwilling to take warfarin, and who were receiving concurrent treatment for HIV infection. Participants were treated with dabigatran with dose monitoring to establish the safety and efficacy of concurrent use with antiretrovirals. All were commenced on 110 mg twice daily, increased to 150 mg twice daily if the trough level was < 69.3 ng\/mL.\nRESULTS: In the 14 patients treated with dabigatran and antiretrovirals, there were no thromboembolic or bleeding complications. Dabigatran treatment was discontinued in one patient because of undetectable dabigatran levels despite dose escalation. Dabigatran levels fell within the fivefold variance seen in the Randomized Evaluation of Long-Term Anticoagulation Therapy (RE-LY) study at a dose of either 110 or 150 mg twice daily.\nCONCLUSIONS: This case series represents the largest published population to date successfully receiving antiretroviral and direct-acting oral anticoagulant therapy.

        "Abstract":"The direct oral anticoagulants (DOACs) are drugs used in clinical practice since 2009 for the prevention of stroke or systemic embolism in non-valvular atrial fibrillation, and for the treatment and secondary prevention of venous thromboembolism. The four DOACs, including the three factor Xa inhibitors (rivaroxaban, apixaban and edoxaban) and one direct thrombin inhibitor (dabigatran) provide oral anticoagulation therapy alternatives to Vitamin K antagonists (VKAs). Despite their clear advantages, the DOACs require on the part of the internist a thorough knowledge of their pharmacokinetic and pharmacodynamic characteristics to ensure their correct use, laboratory monitoring and the appropriate management of adverse events. This document represents a consensus paper on the use of DOACs by representatives of three Italian scientific societies: the Italian Society of Internal Medicine (SIMI), the Federation of the Associations of Hospital Managers (FADOI), and the Society for the Study of Haemostasis and Thrombosis (SISET). This document formulates expert opinion guidance for pragmatic managing, monitoring and reversing the anticoagulant effect of DOACs in both chronic and emergency settings. This practical guidance may help the internist to create adequate protocols for patients hospitalized ion internal medicine wards, where patients are often elderly subjects affected by poly-morbidities and renal insufficiency, and, thus, require particular attention to drug-drug interactions and peri-procedural protocols.",

We included 412 patients treated with rivaroxaban, prescribed for stroke prevention. Three visits were conducted: baseline, 6 and 12 months. Compliance was measured by electronic monitoring systems. QOL was measured by a specific questionnaire. We calculated the percentage of compliance means, the percentage of daily compliers and the score of QOL.\nRESULTS: Three hundred and seventy patients finished the study (mean age 75.19 SD: 7.5 years). Daily compliance was 83.5% (CI 78.53-88.57%) (n = 309) and 80% (CI 74.65-85.35%) at 6 and 12 months, respectively. Average QOL rating was 112.85 (SD 29.31) in non-compliant and 111.80 (SD 29.31) in the compliant group (p = Not significant), and after 12 months of 124.67 (SD 30.78) and 83.47 (SD 26.44), respectively (p < 0.0001), with a decrease in the score compliers (p < 0.01) and an increase in non-compliant group (p < 0.05). A higher number of drugs consumed, as well as the number of diseases\/conditions suffered, the older age of the patients and having been previously treated with VKA were associated with a higher overall score (worse QOL).\nCONCLUSIONS: QOL in NVAF patients treated with rivaroxaban improved significantly over the study group at the expense of compliers. A worse QOL was associated with pluripathology, polymedication, older patients and previous treatment with VKA.",

        "Abstract":"Background We investigated the predictors related to major bleeding events during treatment with edoxaban 15 mg in patients aged ≥80 years with nonvalvular atrial fibrillation and high bleeding risk, for whom standard oral anticoagulants are inappropriate, focusing on standard laboratory tests related to bleeding. Methods and Results This was a prespecified subanalysis of the on-treatment analysis set of the ELDERCARE-AF (Edoxaban Low-Dose for Elder Care Atrial Fibrillation Patients) trial. Major bleeding was the primary safety end point. The event rates were calculated according to prespecified characteristics at baseline. A total of 984 Japanese patients were randomly assigned to edoxaban 15 mg or placebo (n=492, each). During the study period, 20 and 11 major bleeding events occurred in the edoxaban and placebo groups, respectively. The adjusted analysis revealed that hemoglobin <12.3 g\/dL (adjusted hazard ratio [aHR], 3.57 [95% CI, 1.10-11.55]) and prothrombin time ≥12.7 seconds; (aHR, 2.89 [95% CI, 1.05-8.02]) independently predicted major bleeding, while creatinine clearance <30 mL\/min showed a tendency towards an increase in major bleeding (aHR, 2.68; 95% CI, 0.96-7.46). In patients treated with edoxaban lacking these 3 risk factors, no major bleeding occurred; major bleeding event rates increased with each risk factor. Patients with 3 risk factors were significantly more likely to have a major bleeding event at 11.05%\/year (HR, 7.15 [95% CI, 1.92-26.71]). Conclusions In elderly patients with nonvalvular atrial fibrillation with high bleeding risk, baseline hemoglobin <12.3 g\/dL, prothrombin time ≥12.7 seconds, and creatinine clearance <30 mL\/min may predict major bleeding during treatment with edoxaban 15 mg.

The aim of this study was to conduct a population pharmacokinetic-pharmacodynamic (PK-PD) analysis of rivaroxaban in Chinese patients with NVAF to assess ethnic differences and provide model-based precision dosing. A total of 256 rivaroxaban plasma concentrations and 244 prothrombin time (PT) measurements were obtained from 195 Chinese NVAF patients from a prospective clinical trial. The population PK-PD model was developed using nonlinear mixed effects modeling (NONMEM) software. The PK of rivaroxaban was adequately described using a one-compartment model with first-order adsorption and elimination. Estimated glomerular filtration rate (eGFR) was identified as a major covariate for apparent clearance. No single nucleotide polymorphism was identified as a significant covariate. PT exhibited a linear relationship with rivaroxaban concentration. Total bilirubin (TBIL) and eGFR were identified as significant covariates for baseline PT. According to the Monte Carlo simulation, 15 mg for Chinese patients with eGFR ≥50 mL\/min and normal liver function yielded an exposure comparable to 20 mg for Caucasian patients. Patients with moderately impaired renal function may require a lower dose of rivaroxaban to avoid overexposure. Moreover, there was an approximate 26% increase in PT levels in patients with TBIL of 34 μmol\/L and eGFR of 30 mL\/min, which could increase the risk of major bleeding. The established population PK-PD model could inform individualized dosing for Chinese NVAF patients who are administered rivaroxaban.",

This study compared healthcare costs before and after stroke in NVAF patients treated with rivaroxaban or warfarin.\nMATERIALS AND METHODS: Using de-identified IBM MarketScan Commercial and Medicare databases, this retrospective cohort study (from 2011 to 2019) included patients with NVAF who initiated rivaroxaban or warfarin within 30 days after initial NVAF diagnosis. Patients who developed stroke were identified, and stroke severity was determined by the National Institutes of Health Stroke Scale (NIHSS) score, imputed by a random forest method. Total all-cause per-patient per-year (PPPY) costs of care were determined for patients: (1) who developed stroke during the pre- and post-stroke periods and (2) who remained stroke-free during the follow-up period. Treatment groups were balanced using inverse probability of treatment weighting.\nRESULTS: A total of 13,599 patients initiated rivaroxaban and 39,861 initiated warfarin, of which 272 (2.0%) and 1,303 (3.3%), respectively, developed stroke during a mean follow-up of 28 months. Among patients who developed stroke, PPPY costs increased from the pre-stroke to post-stroke period, with greater increases in the warfarin cohort relative to the rivaroxaban cohort. Overall, the costs increased by 1.78-fold for rivaroxaban vs 3.07-fold for warfarin; for less severe strokes (NIHSS < 5), costs increased 0.88-fold and 1.05-fold, respectively. Cost increases for more severe strokes (NIHSS ≥ 5) among rivaroxaban patients were half those for warfarin patients (3.19-fold vs 6.37-fold, respectively). Among patients without stroke, costs were similar during the follow-up period between the two treatment groups.\nCONCLUSIONS: Total all-cause costs of care increased in the post-stroke period, and particularly in the patients treated with warfarin relative to those treated with rivaroxaban. The lower rate of stroke in the rivaroxaban cohort suggests that greater pre- to post-stroke cost increases result from more strokes occurring in the warfarin cohort.",

        "Abstract":"OBJECTIVES: Several direct oral anticoagulants (DOACs) have been approved by the European Medicines Agency since 2008. The aim of the present cost-effectiveness-analysis was to analyze apixaban compared to other DOACs and vitamin K antagonists (warfarin) in Austria.\nMETHODS: A cost-utility-model was developed to simulate lifetime-costs and quality-adjusted-life-years of DOACs and warfarin, based on a published Markov-Model and 23 randomized trials with 94,656 atrial-fibrillation (AF) patients. Each year, a patient has a probability of suffering a clinically relevant (extracranial) bleed, an intracranial hemorrhage (ICH), an ischemic stroke or a myocardial infarction (MI), remaining healthy, or deceasing. Direct-costs (2018€) were derived from published sources from the payer's perspective.\nRESULTS: In the base-case, warfarin had the lowest cost of 12,968 € (95%-CI±593 €) followed by apixaban (15,269 €±661 €), edoxaban (15,534 €±641 €), dabigatran (15,687 €±667 €), and rivaroxaban (17,522 €±764 €). Apixaban had the highest quality-adjusted-life-years estimate at 5.45 (SD, 0.06). In a Monte-Carlo probabilistic sensitivity analysis, apixaban was cost-effective vs. edoxaban, dabigatran, warfarin, and rivaroxaban in 85.6%, 79.0%, 76.4%, and 61.2% of the simulations, respectively.\nCONCLUSION: In patients with AF and an increased risk of stroke, prophylaxis with apixaban was highly cost-effective from the perspective of the Austrian health-care system.",

        "Abstract":"['2', '2', '2', '2']\n['2', '2']\nAnticoagulation is highly effective for the prevention of stroke in patients with atrial fibrillation (AF) but it is dependent on patients continuing therapy. While studies have demonstrated suboptimal therapeutic persistence on warfarin, few have studied persistence rates with non vitamin K antagonist oral anticoagulants (NOACs) such as dabigatran. We examined rates of continued use of dabigatran versus warfarin over 1 year among AF patients in the ORBIT-AF registry between June 29, 2010 and August 09, 2011. Multivariable logistic regression analysis was used to identify characteristics associated with 1-year persistent use of dabigatran therapy or warfarin. At baseline, 6.4 and 93.6% of 7150 AF patients were on dabigatran and warfarin, respectively. At 12 months, dabigatran-treated patients were less likely to have continued their therapy than warfarin-treated patients [Adjusted persistence rates: 66% (95% CI 60-72) vs. 82% (95% CI 80-84), p < .0001]. Predictors of dabigatran persistence included: CHADS-VASc risk scores ≥ 2 OR 5.69, (95% CI 1.50-21.6) and BMI greater than 25 mg\/m but less than 38 kg\/m 1.05 (1.01-1.09). Predictors of persistence on warfarin included: African American race (vs. White) 1.53 (1.07-2.19), Hispanic ethnicity (vs. White) 1.66 (1.06-2.60), paroxysmal and persistent AF (vs. new-onset) 1.68 (1.21-2.33) and 1.91 (1.35-2.69) respectively, LVH 1.40 (1.08-1.81), and CHADS-VASc risk scores ≥ 2 1.94 (1.18-3.19). While 1-year persistence rates for dabigatran were lower than warfarin, persistence rates for both agents were not ideal. Future studies evaluating contemporary persistence are needed in order to assist in better targeting interventions aimed to improve anticoagulation persistence.",

        "Published":null,
        "Abstract":"AIMS: The stroke risk of patients with atrial fibrillation (AF) is not static, since AF patients get older and accumulate more comorbidities after AF is diagnosed. Therefore, the stroke risk of AF patients given certain comorbidities in different age strata should ideally be analysed using an assessment which considers incident comorbidities and the actual age when ischaemic stroke occurred. The goal of the present study is to report the age treatment thresholds for the use of non-vitamin K antagonist oral anticoagulants (NOACs) for AF patients without or with only one comorbidity of the CHA2DS2-VASc score, based on an 'ideal method' of stroke risk assessments.\nMETHODS AND RESULTS: The study cohort included 31 039 and 39 020 AF patients who did not have any or had only one risk factor comorbidity of the CHA2DS2-VASc score except for age and sex. The risks of ischaemic stroke in each age strata for each comorbidities were analysed in three ways, as follows: (i) the conventional way (based on baseline risk factors and age), (ii) dynamic method (patients were censored when new comorbidities occurred), and (iii) an ideal method (patients were censored when new comorbidities occurred and the stroke risk was related to the actual age when stroke happened). The tipping point for the use of NOACs was set at a stroke risk of 0.9%\/year. The overall risk of ischaemic stroke using the conventional way was overestimated compared to the dynamic or ideal assessment with the incidence rate ratio of 1.24 for patients with hypertension, 1.20 for heart failure, 1.37 for diabetes mellitus, and 1.38 for vascular diseases; all P-values <0.01. The risk of ischaemic stroke for each age strata was generally higher with the conventional or dynamic methods compared with the ideal assessment. With heart failure, the tipping point (age 35 years) of NOACs was similar, irrespective of methods used for stroke risk assessment. According to the results of ideal assessment, the age thresholds for the use of NOACs for patients with hypertension, diabetes mellitus, and vascular diseases were 50 years, 50 years, and 55 years, respectively.\nCONCLUSION: Ischaemic stroke risk in AF is heterogeneous, depending on different risk factors with age being as an important driver of stroke risk. Age thresholds for the use of NOACs were different for AF patients having different single risk factors beyond sex despite the same CHA2DS2-VASc score point (1 for males and 2 for females); that is, 35 years for heart failure, 50 years for hypertension or diabetes, and 55 years for vascular diseases.",

In addition to standard baseline characteristics, prothrombin time and anti-Xa activity will be measured to investigate the biomarker characteristics. The primary efficacy endpoints will be stroke and systemic embolism, and the primary safety endpoint will be major bleeding requiring hospitalization. The secondary endpoints in this study will be all-cause death, cardiovascular death, acute myocardial infarction, and the composite of stroke\/systemic embolism, cardiovascular death, and acute myocardial infarction. As a primary analysis, the primary\/secondary endpoints in the enrolled patients will be totalized for the entire group, and the incidence of events will be described by age, CHADS score, HAS-BLED score, and apixaban dose (5 or 2.5mg bid). The factors that independently predict the incidence of the primary\/secondary endpoints will be searched for by Cox regression.

        "Abstract":"BACKGROUND: Antiplatelet therapy (APT) use in combination with oral anticoagulation is common among patients with atrial fibrillation, but there is scarce information regarding its effect on outcomes in patients on non-vitamin K antagonist oral anticoagulants (NOAC). We aimed to evaluate the safety and efficacy of APT use in a 'real-world' cohort of nonvalvular atrial fibrillation (NVAF) patients initiating NOAC.\nDESIGN: We conducted a retrospective multicentre study including 2361 consecutive NVAF patients initiating NOAC between January 2013 and December 2016. Patients with an acute ischaemic event within the last 12 months (acute coronary syndrome, stroke or revascularization) were excluded. Patients were followed up, and all clinical events were recorded at 3 months. The primary outcome of the study was major bleeding, and the secondary outcomes were stroke, nonfatal myocardial infarction, intracranial bleeding and death.\nRESULTS: One hundred forty-five (6.1%) patients received concomitant APT, and aspirin was the more common (79%). At 3 months, 25 (1.1%) patients had major bleeding, 8 (0.3%) had nonfatal myocardial infarction, 7 (0.3%) had ischaemic stroke, and 40 (1.7%) died. After multivariate adjustment, concomitant APT was associated with higher risk for major bleeding (HR = 3.62, 95% CI 1.32-9.89; P = .012), but was not associated with a higher risk of other clinical outcomes.\nCONCLUSIONS: Concomitant APT use is uncommon among these patients and does not seem to be associated with lower rates of ischaemic events or death.

        "Abstract":"BACKGROUND: Direct oral anticoagulants (DOAC) including edoxaban are increasingly used for stroke prevention in atrial fibrillation. Despite treatment, annual stroke rate in these patients remains 1-2%. Rapid assessment of coagulation would be useful to guide thrombolysis or reversal therapy in this growing population of DOAC\/edoxaban-treated stroke patients. Employing the Hemochron™ Signature Elite point-of-care test system (HC-POCT), clinically relevant plasma concentrations of dabigatran and rivaroxaban can be excluded in a blood sample. However, no data exists on the effect of edoxaban on HC-POCT results. We evaluated whether edoxaban plasma concentrations above the current treatment thresholds for thrombolysis or anticoagulation reversal (i.e., 30 and 50 ng\/mL) can be ruled out with the HC-POCT.\nMETHODS: We prospectively studied patients receiving a first dose of edoxaban. Six blood samples were collected from each patient: before, 0.5, 1, 2, 8, and 24 h after drug intake. HC-POCT-based INR (HC-INR), activated clotting time (HC-ACT+ and HC-ACT-LR), activated partial thromboplastin time (HC-aPTT), and mass spectrometry for edoxaban plasma concentrations were performed at each time-point. We calculated correlations, receiver operating characteristics (ROC) and test-specific cut-offs for ruling out edoxaban concentrations > 30 and > 50 ng\/mL in a blood sample.\nRESULTS: One hundred twenty blood samples from 20 edoxaban-treated patients were analyzed. Edoxaban plasma concentrations ranged from 0 to 512 ng\/mL. HC-INR\/HC-ACT+\/HC-ACT-LR\/HC-aPTT ranged from 0.7-8.3\/78-310 s\/65-215 s\/19-93 s, and Pearson's correlation coefficients showed moderate to very strong correlations with edoxaban concentrations (r = 0.95\/0.79\/0.70\/0.60). With areas under the ROC curve of 0.997 (95% confidence interval: 0.991-0.971) and 0.989 (0.975-1.000), HC-INR most reliably ruled out edoxaban concentrations > 30 and > 50 ng\/mL, respectively, and HC-INR results ≤1.5 and ≤ 2.1 provided specificity\/sensitivity of 98.6% (91.2-99.9)\/98.0% (88.0-99.9) and 96.8% (88.0-99.4)\/96.5% (86.8-99.4).\nCONCLUSIONS: Our study represents the first systematic evaluation of the HC-POCT in edoxaban-treated patients. Applying sufficiently low assay-specific cut-offs, the HC-POCT may not only be used to reliably rule out dabigatran and rivaroxaban, but also very low edoxaban concentrations in a blood sample. Because the assay-specific cut-offs were retrospectively defined, further investigation is warranted.\nTRIAL REGISTRATION: ClinicalTrials.gov, registration number: NCT02825394 , registered on: 07\/07\/2016, URL.",

There is an issue with safety, especially in clinically relevant bleeding. We performed a network meta-analysis to evaluate the risk of major gastrointestinal (GI) bleeding associated with NOACs.\nMETHODS: Interventions were warfarin, enoxaparin, apixaban, dabigatran, edoxaban, and rivaroxaban. The primary outcome was the incidence of major GI bleeding. A subgroup analysis was performed according to the following indications: AF, deep venous thrombosis\/pulmonary embolism, and postsurgical prophylaxis.\nRESULTS: A total of 29 randomized controlled trials (RCTs) and 4 large observation population studies were included. Compared with warfarin, apixaban showed a decreased the risk of major GI bleeding (relative risk [RR] 0.54, 95% confidence interval [CI] 0.25-0.76), and rivaroxaban tended to increase this risk (RR 1.40, 95% CI 1.06-1.85). Dabigatran (RR 1.25, 95% CI 0.98-1.60), edoxaban (RR 1.07, 95% CI 0.69-1.65), and enoxaparin (RR 1.24, 95% CI 0.63-2.43) did not significantly increase the risk of GI bleeding than did warfarin. In the subgroup analysis, according to indications, apixaban showed a decreased risk of major GI bleeding (RR 0.50, 95% CI 0.34-0.74) than did warfarin in AF studies.

An analysis of studies on venous thromboembolism or pulmonary embolism showed that no individual NOAC or enoxaparin was associated with an increased risk of major GI bleeding compared to warfarin.\nCONCLUSION: Individual NOACs had varying profiles of GI bleeding risk.

        "Abstract":"['2', '2', '2', '2']\nAnticoagulation with direct-acting oral anticoagulants (DOACs) is recommended over warfarin for stroke prevention in patients with atrial fibrillation (AF). The efficacy of DOACs over warfarin in obese patients with AF is less defined and may carry the potential for subtherapeutic anticoagulation and reduced efficacy. The best available evidence to guide DOAC use in obese patients with AF is from analysis of obese subgroups of all the major landmark DOAC trials. From these subgroup analyses of the RE-LY, ARISTOTLE, ENGAGE-AF TIMI 48, and ROCKET-AF trials, DOAC use in obese patients demonstrated efficacy similar or superior to warfarin for stroke reduction. Major bleeding rates were similar or higher with DOACs compared with warfarin in these obese subgroup analyses. Meta-analysis of the above major clinical trials concluded that DOACs were more effective compared with warfarin for stroke prevention in obese patients (up to a body mass index [BMI] of 50 kg\/m) and had lower incidence of major bleeding. The totality of evidence supports that DOACs are as effective, if not superior, to warfarin in obese patients with AF. We propose an algorithm, based on the available evidence and current guidelines, to guide the use of DOACs based on severity of obesity. Any DOAC can be used in obese patients with BMI < 40 kg\/m. In patients with a BMI of 40-50 kg\/m, warfarin should be used, but apixaban or edoxaban can be considered. In obese patients with a BMI > 50 kg\/m, warfarin should be used.",

There were no significant differences in anti-Xa activity or in platelet aggregation comparing rivaroxaban-treated and apixaban-treated patients.\nCONCLUSIONS: This study showed that factor Xa inhibition does not affect ADP-induced, epinephrine-induced, and collagen-induced platelet aggregation.",

        "Abstract":"12\nThe number of patients with atrial fibrillation (AF) is increasing due to the aging of the population. In addition, the number of patients with AF and an indication for oral anticoagulation (OAC) for the prevention of strokes increases, who are in need for a dual antiplatelet therapy (DAPT) with acetyl salicylic acid (ASA) plus a P2Y-Inhibitor because of an acute coronary syndrome and\/or coronary stent implantation. These patients did receive a triple therapy (TT) for 3-12 months in the past. Triple therapy never has been studied for efficacy or safety, however, the rate of bleeding complications in comparison to OAC or DAPT is significantly higher.Registries and smaller trials showed that dual therapy with an OAC plus a single platelet inhibitor may be sufficient to prevent strokes and stent thromboses\/myocardial infarctions. Four prospective randomized trials involving all four NOACs (Non-Vitamin K oral anticoagulants) approved for stroke prevention in AF have been undertaken. The NOACs plus one antiplatelet agent were tested versus vitamin K-antagonists plus DAPT. In the meantime, the trials involving rivaroxaban (PIONEER AF-PCI), dabigatran (RE-DUAL PCI), apixaban (AUGUSTUS), and edoxaban (ENTRUST-AF-PCI) have been published. The current status is that a NOAC plus a single antiplatelet agent, mostly clopidogrel, is superior to TT with respect to the bleeding complications, without any obvious and statistically significant disadvantage for stroke rates or cardiac ischemic events. The international guidelines already recommend to treat with a NOAC and one antiplatelet agent instead of TT in case the patients bleeding risk is prevailing. Thus, TT seems not to be indicated anymore for most patients with AF and ACS or PCI.",

        "Abstract":"BACKGROUND: This study aimed to analyze associations between genetic variants and plasma concentrations along with clinical outcomes in dabigatran in patients with non-valvular atrial fibrillation (NVAF).\nMETHODS: We conducted a prospective study and enrolled NVAF patients treated with dabigatran in the real world. A total of 86 patients treated with 110 mg DE twice daily were recruited for this study. Blood samples were obtained from each patient and used for genotyping and determination of plasma dabigatran concentration. All bleeding and thromboembolic complications were recorded during the 1.5 years of follow-up.\nRESULTS: Eighty-three patients provided samples at the trough plasma level of dabigatran, and 58 patients provided samples at the peak plasma level of dabigatran. There was a significant association between the CES1 SNP rs8192935 and trough plasma concentrations of dabigatran (P = 0.013). Our results showed that the CES1 SNP rs8192935 significantly influenced dabigatran trough concentrations in the Chinese population, and carriers of the G allele had increased trough plasma concentrations of dabigatran compared to noncarriers.

        "Abstract":"BACKGROUND: The extent to which the introduction of direct oral anticoagulants (DOACs) influenced treatment patterns in frail and nonfrail patients with nonvalvular atrial fibrillation (NVAF) is unclear.\nMETHODS: This was a retrospective cohort study of all Albertans 20 years or older who were discharged from an emergency department or hospital with a new diagnosis of NVAF between April 1, 2009, and March 31, 2019. The Hospital Frailty Risk Score was used to define frailty and the CHADS-VASc and CHADS-65 scores were used to identify if anticoagulation was indicated.\nRESULTS: Among 75,796 patients (median age, 75 years; 45% female) with a new diagnosis of NVAF, 17,143 (22.6%) were frail. Although guideline criteria for anticoagulation were more commonly met by frail patients than nonfrail patients (92.1% vs 74.2%, for CHADS-VASc, and 96.8% vs 85.8% for CHADS-65; both P < 0.0001), frail patients were less likely to receive any anticoagulant, even after those with contraindications to anticoagulation were excluded (adjusted odds ratio, 0.61; 95% confidence interval, 0.58-0.64). After DOACs became available, anticoagulant prescribing for patients with guideline indications increased more in nonfrail patients (from 42.4% to 68.2%) than in frail patients (from 29.0% to 52.2%) and frail patients were less likely to receive a DOAC than warfarin (adjusted odds ratio, 0.66; 95% confidence interval, 0.54-0.81).\nCONCLUSIONS: Although they stand to potentially derive greater benefits from anticoagulation, frail patients were less likely to receive an anticoagulant and, if anticoagulated, they were more likely to receive warfarin than a DOAC.

Depending on the nature of the vulnerability, their participation may challenge the ethical principles of autonomy, non-maleficence, or justice. On the other hand, non-participation may preclude the building of a knowledge base that is a prerequisite for defining the optimal clinical management of vulnerable patients. Such clinical uncertainty may also incur substantial economic costs.\nMAIN TEXT: We present the participation of pre-menopausal women with atrial fibrillation in trials of novel oral anticoagulant drugs as a case study. Due to their non-participation in pivotal trials, it is uncertain whether for them, the risks that are associated with these drugs are outweighed by the advantages compared with conventional treatment. We addressed the question whether research of this new class of drugs in this subgroup would be appropriate from both, an ethical as well an economic perspective. We used the method of specifying norms as a wider framework to resolve the apparent ethical dilemma, while incorporating the question whether research of oral anticoagulants in premenopausal women with atrial fibrillation can be justified on economic grounds. For the latter, the results of a value-of-information analysis were used.\nCONCLUSIONS: Further clinical research on NOACs in premenopausal women with atrial fibrillation can be justified on both, ethical and economic grounds. Addressing apparent ethical dilemmas by invoking a method such as specifying norms can improve the quality of public practical reasoning. As such, the method should also prove valuable to committees that have formally been granted the authority to review trial protocols and proposals for scientific research.",

        "Abstract":"The use of direct oral anticoagulants (DOACs) is widely increasing in the United States (US). Warfarin has been the conventional anticoagulant used in the past few decades, but it has been gradually replaced by DOACs. The objective of the study was to analyze trends in utilization, reimbursement, and price for those anticoagulants in the US Medicaid population. Retrospective data analysis was conducted using the National Summary Files for the Medicaid State Drug Utilization Data. Study drugs included dabigatran, rivaroxaban, apixaban, edoxaban and warfarin. The study assessed secular trends of utilization, reimbursement, and per-prescription price. The data was collected from the first quarter of 2000 through to the second quarter of 2020 restricted for outpatient prescriptions only. During the 21-year study period, a substantial rise in total expenditures on warfarin and DOACs was observed from $144 million in 2000 to $694 million in 2020. Moreover, the utilization of DOACs has increased significantly since the first approval of Xarelto in 2010 from 1079 in 2011 to 1.5 million in 2019. The per-prescription price of DOACs increased from an average of $200 in 2011 to $407 in 2020. Conversely, the total number of prescriptions of Warfarin and branded Coumadin decreased from 2.4 million to 1.4 million and from 3.9 million to less than a million, respectively. The present study demonstrated a change in the trends of US expenditure and utilization for warfarin and DOACs with DOACs representing the majority of market share of both spending per prescription and reimbursement.",

There is a need to compare low-dose DOACs with warfarin or other DOACs on effectiveness and safety.  Using administrative data from Quebec province, Canada, we built a cohort of new warfarin or DOAC users discharged from hospital between 2011 and 2017. We determined CHADS-VASc and HAS-BLED scores, and comorbidities for 3-year prior cohort entry. The primary effectiveness endpoint was a composite of ischemic stroke\/systemic embolism (SE), and secondary outcomes included a safety composite of major bleeding (MB) events and effectiveness composite (stroke\/SE, death) at 1-year follow-up. We contrasted each low-dose DOAC with warfarin or other DOACs as references using inverse probability of treatment weighting to estimate marginal Cox hazard ratios (HRs).  The cohort comprised 22,969 patients (mean age: 80-86). We did not find a significant risk reduction for the stroke\/SE primary effectiveness endpoint for DOACs vs. warfarin; however, we observed a significantly lower risk for low-dose dabigatran vs. warfarin (HR [95%CI]: 0.59 [0.42-0.81]) for effectiveness composite, mainly due to a lower death rate. The differences in effectiveness and safety composites between low-dose rivaroxaban vs. warfarin were not significant. However, low-dose apixaban had a better safety composite (HR: 0.68 [0.53-0.88]) vs. warfarin. Comparisons of dabigatran vs. apixaban showed a lower risk of stroke\/SE (HR: 0.53 [0.30-0.93]) and a 2-fold higher risk of MB. The MB risk was higher for rivaroxaban than for apixaban (HR: 1.58 [1.09-2.29]).  The results of this population-based study suggest that low-dose dabigatran has a better effective composite than warfarin. Compared with apixaban, low-dose dabigatran had a better effectiveness composite but a worse safety profile. Low-dose apixaban had a better safety composite than warfarin and other low-dose DOACs. Given that the comparative effectiveness and safety seem to vary from one DOAC to another, pharmacokinetic data for specific populations are now warranted.",

Asians have higher risks of bleeding complications when taking anticoagulants. However, evidence that considers laboratory parameters is lacking. Objective We aimed to compare the safety and effectiveness between direct oral anticoagulants and warfarin in Asian patients with nonvalvular atrial fibrillation. Setting Retrospective design using hospital-based data. Method This propensity score-matched cohort study included data extracted from the electronic medical records of the En Chu Kong Hospital Research Database. Main outcome measure Outcome measures were major bleeding and thromboembolism. Cox proportional hazard models were applied for evaluating hazard ratios with 95% confidence intervals. Results Among 1075 patients with nonvalvular atrial fibrillation, 687 and 388 were administered direct oral anticoagulants and warfarin, respectively. After propensity score matching, 264 patient pairs were selected. Compared with warfarin use, direct oral anticoagulant use was associated with similar risks for major bleeding and thromboembolism; however, the latter was associated with increased gastrointestinal bleeding risks (adjusted hazard ratio 3.59; 95% confidence interval, 1.31-11.39). Notably, an approximately 10 fold increased risk of gastrointestinal bleeding was observed in 0-6 month direct oral anticoagulant users (adjusted hazard ratio 10.13, 95% confidence interval 1.27-80.89).

        "Abstract":"BACKGROUND: Optimal antithrombotic treatment after transcatheter aortic valve replacement (TAVR) is unknown and determined empirically. The direct factor Xa inhibitor rivaroxaban may potentially reduce TAVR-related thrombotic complications and premature valve failure.\nDESIGN: GALILEO is an international, randomized, open-label, event-driven, phase III trial in more than 1,520 patients without an indication for oral anticoagulation who underwent a successful TAVR (ClinicalTrials.govNCT02556203). Patients are randomized (1:1 ratio), 1 to 7days after a successful TAVR, to either a rivaroxaban-based strategy or an antiplatelet-based strategy. In the experimental arm, subjects receive rivaroxaban (10mg once daily [OD]) plus acetylsalicylic acid (ASA, 75-100mg OD) for 90days followed by rivaroxaban alone. In the control arm, subjects receive clopidogrel (75mg OD) plus ASA (as above) for 90days followed by ASA alone. In case new-onset atrial fibrillation occurs after randomization, full oral anticoagulation will be implemented with maintenance of the original treatment assignment. The primary efficacy end point is the composite of all-cause death, stroke, myocardial infarction, symptomatic valve thrombosis, pulmonary embolism, deep venous thrombosis, and systemic embolism. The primary safety end point is the composite of life-threatening, disabling, and major bleeding, according to the Valve Academic Research Consortium definitions.\nCONCLUSIONS: GALILEO will test the hypothesis that a rivaroxaban-based antithrombotic strategy reduces the risk of thromboembolic complications post-TAVR with an acceptable risk of bleeding compared with the currently recommended antiplatelet therapy-based strategy in subjects without need of chronic oral anticoagulation.",

        "Abstract":"BACKGROUND: Dabigatran is the first oral direct thrombin inhibitor which is endorsed by Food and Drug Administration in the prevention of embolic events in patients with nonvalvular atrial fibrillation. Suitable dose of the drug for the patient is selected based on CHA2DS2-VASc score and HAS-BLED score.\nAIM: To determine and compare the risk of occurrence of stroke and bleeding after the initiation of dabigatran therapy in patients prescribed with this drug.\nMETHODS: Patients with more than 18 years who were prescribed with dabigatran during 2017-2019 in a tertiary care hospital were selected for the study. Most of the patient's prescriptions contained an antiplatelet, so a comparison was made between the clinical outcomes of patients given with dabigatran alone and dabigatran with an antiplatelet because antiplatelet can have effects on the safety as well as efficacy profile of dabigatran.\nRESULTS: Out of 75 patients enrolled in the study, 42 patients were in the dabigatran with the antiplatelet group and 33 were in the dabigatran alone group. In both the groups, there was a significant reduction in CHADS-VASc score, i.e., 2.58 ± 1.32-1.94 ± 1.21 in dabigatran-treated patients within 6 months, and the score was lowered from 3.76 ± 1.22 to 2.92 ± 1.22 in other groups. The mean value of the HAS-BLED score of dabigatran was reduced from 1.15 ± 0.83 to 0.84 ± 0.78 and that of dabigatran with antiplatelet group from 2.10 ± 0.94 to 1.74 ± 0.92.\nCONCLUSION: It was observed that within 6 months, both the treatment groups showed a reduction in the risk scores. The dabigatran group had lower background risks of stroke and bleeding in comparison to the dabigatran plus antiplatelet group.",

Sixty-five AF patients with a CHA2DS2-VASc score ≥2 without previous history of cardiovascular disease were registered and randomly assigned to either an NOAC group (dabigatran or rivaroxaban) or the warfarin group. Reactive hyperemia peripheral arterial tonometry (RH-PAT) measurements reflecting endothelial function were taken using Endo-PAT2000. Carotid intima-media thickness (IMT) was measured at baseline, 12 months, and 24 months, and several biomarkers were also analyzed. For the primary end point, the reactive hyperemia index (RHI) for the NOAC group was 1.5 ± 0.4 and that for the warfarin group was 1.6 ± 0.5. The left and right carotid IMT was 0.7 mm in the NOAC groups and 0.8 mm in the warfarin group. At 12 months, RHI was 1.6 ± 0.3 for the dabigatran group, 1.6 ± 0.5 for the rivaroxaban group, and 1.6 ± 0.3 for the warfarin group. The three groups did not differ statistically with respect to change in left and right carotid IMT at 12 and 24 months, respectively. The biomarkers for endothelial function and atherosclerosis were not significantly different. There was a trend of reduced P-selectin levels in the NOAC group compared to the warfarin group.

Based on guidelines criteria for dose reduction, two subcohorts were defined as treated with appropriate or inappropriate NOACs dose. Primary efficacy endpoint was 2-year rate of thromboembolic events. Primary safety endpoint was 2-year rate of major bleeding. Event-free survival curves among groups were compared using Cox-Mantel test.\nRESULTS: A total of 760 nonvalvular atrial fibrillation patients were included; 32% patients were treated with dabigatran, 34% with apixaban, 24% with rivaroxaban and 10% with edoxaban.

        "Abstract":"AIMS: The non-vitamin K antagonist oral anticoagulants (NOACs) have varying degrees of renal elimination which may be challenging in patients with heart failure (HF) and atrial fibrillation (AF). We examined the severity and variation in renal impairment, and the proportion of patients requiring NOAC cessation or dose reduction.\nMETHODS AND RESULTS: A retrospective analysis of patients with HF and AF in the Candesartan in Heart failure Assessment of Reduction in Mortality and Morbidity programme was carried out. Trends in renal impairment over 26 months were defined using Cockcroft-Gault (CG), simplified Modification of Diet in Renal Disease (MDRD), and Chronic Kidney Disease Epidemiology Collaboration (CKD-EPI) equations. Mean estimated glomerular filtration rate (eGFR) was worse at every time point in patients with AF compared with those without AF, the difference being ∼11 mL\/min (CG), 9 mL\/min (CKD-EPI), and 7 mL\/min (MDRD). As renal function declined, CG classified a greater proportion of patients as having moderate or severe CKD and agreement with MDRD\/CKD-EPI declined. At least moderate renal impairment was present in a quarter of patients with AF at baseline, a third by study completion, and approaching a half at least once during follow-up. The projected need for NOAC dose reduction was accordingly high, though it varied between individual NOACs due to different criteria for adjustment.\nCONCLUSIONS: Renal impairment in patients with HF and AF is common, fluctuates, progresses, and frequently mandates NOAC dose reduction, though the need for cessation is rare. Baseline renal function, the method of estimating GFR, and intensity of monitoring should be considered when commencing oral anticoagulation.",

Identifying patients without AF who are at high-risk of developing this arrhythmia has important clinical implications.\nAIMS: To develop a risk score to identify HF patients at high risk of developing AF.\nMETHODS: The COMMANDER-HF trial enrolled 5022 patients with HF and a LVEF ≤ 40%, history of coronary artery disease, and absence of AF at baseline (confirmed with an electrocardiogram). Patients were randomized to either rivaroxaban (2.5 mg bid) or placebo. New-onset AF was confirmed by the investigator at study visits.\nRESULTS: 241 (4.8%) patients developed AF during the follow-up (median 21 months). Older age (≥ 65 years), LVEF < 35%, history of PCI or CABG, White race, SBP < 110 mmHg, and higher BMI (≥ 25 kg\/m) were independently associated with risk of new-onset AF, whereas the use of DAPT was associated with a lower risk of new-onset AF. We then built a risk score from these variables (with good accuracy C-index = 0.71) and calibration across observed and predicted tertiles of risk. New-onset AF events rates increased steeply by increasing tertiles of the risk-score. Compared to tertile 1, the risk of new-onset AF was 2.5-fold higher in tertile 2, and 6.3-fold higher in tertile 3. Rivaroxaban had no effect in reducing new-onset AF. In time-updated models, new-onset AF was associated with a higher risk of subsequent all-cause death: HR (95%CI) 1.38 (1.11-1.73).\nCONCLUSIONS: A well-calibrated risk-score identified patients at risk of new-onset AF in the COMMANDER-HF trial.

        "Abstract":"['2', '2', '2', '2', '2']\nIn clinical practice, some atrial fibrillation (AF) patients were classified as having low and moderate stroke risk by the CHADS score (≤ 1) in 2001 but in 2012 they were not truly classified as low risk of stroke according to the CHADS-VASc score (≥ 2) (defined gray zone). Therefore, a treatment gap exists in gray zone AF patients. This study aimed to evaluate whether gray zone AF patients could benefit from reduced all-cause mortality under antithrombotic treatment. This was a longitudinal cohort study performed using data from claim forms submitted to the Taiwan Bureau of National Health Insurance from January 2000 to December 2011. The new-onset AF patients consisted of a gray zone cohort with a total of 1237 patients being enrolled. The primary outcome was all-cause mortality between 2001 and 2011. Patients in the gray zone receiving antithrombotic treatment had a significant reduction in all-cause mortality [hazard ratio (HR): 0.21; 95% confidence interval (CI): 0.16-0.28] compared with the no treatment group [warfarin only: HR, 0.28 (95% CI, 0.15-0.52); warfarin + Aspirin: HR, 0.21 (95% CI, 0.15-0.30); and Aspirin only: HR, 0.22 (95% CI, 0.16-0.29) ]. All-cause mortality was notably increased when any of the following risk factors were present: age 65-74 years, age ≥ 75 years, chronic kidney disease, and vascular disease. We concluded that AF patients in the gray zone must receive either anticoagulant and\/or antiplatelet treatment and there is a lower mortality in these groups during long-term follow-up. Further investigation is needed to observe whether the antithrombotic drugs have benefits for patients with AF with a CHADS-VASc score < 2.",

We analyzed ischemic stroke, intracranial hemorrhage, hospitalization for gastrointestinal bleeding, major bleeding, all-cause death, and the composite clinical outcome according to BMI categories.\nRESULTS: A total of 43 173 patients were included across BMI categories (kg\/m): underweight (<18.5) in 3%, normal (18.5 to <23) in 28%, overweight (23 to <25) in 24%, obese I (25 to <30) in 39%, and obese II (≥30) in 6%.

The challenges in providing these include cost and access issues, the doctor-patient relationship and the provision of education. While consensus for developing evidence-based pathways to maximise efficiency and effectiveness of AF treatment was evident, it would require a shared vision between stakeholders of integrated care. The benefits of embracing technological advances for clinicians and patients were evident; however, clinicians indicate this can increase pressure on already stretched resources; coupled with institutional barriers (including scarce resources) arising from the complex nature of anticoagulation for patients with AF, which emerged strongly. Including the unpredictable nature of warfarin, hidden costs associated with monitoring, adverse clinical effects, different patient cohorts (including those prescribed anticoagulant for the first time vs those switching from warfarin to a new oral anticoagulant (NOAC)), non-adherence concerns and undesirable impacts on patients' daily lives.\nCONCLUSIONS: While anticoagulation therapy for patients with AF using NOACs has been widely adopted and is diffusing into routine practice, significant operationalisation issues and barriers to effective treatment\/management persist.

        "Abstract":"PURPOSE: Qualitative research on atrial fibrillation (AF) patient's experiences and perceptions of taking the non-vitamin K antagonist oral anticoagulants (NOACs) for stroke prevention is limited. This study explores patients' experiences of dabigatran and their recommendations for development of educational materials.\nPATIENTS AND METHODS: Semi-structured individual interviews with 8 warfarin-naive and 8 warfarin-experienced AF patients, using qualitative deductive thematic analysis.\nRESULTS: The four main overarching themes included: understanding the diagnosis; reaching a treatment decision; challenges of living with OAC; and patient perceptions of treatment. Patients discussed their shock of diagnosis, and seeking information and support at that time. Narratives suggest patients preferred to be led by the doctor when making treatment decisions, and would often compare dabigatran to warfarin. Patients reported side-effects and challenges with both treatment options, and discussed their beliefs surrounding medications, including misconceptions. In addition to the original framework, two further themes were added: challenges of living with AF, and patient recommendations. Generally patients found AF symptoms distressing, which impacted their quality of life. Patient recommendations included the content and delivery of educational materials and development of tools to help with their understanding of AF and anticoagulation, as well as treatment adherence and anxiety surrounding symptoms and side effects.\nCONCLUSION: Patient recommendations emphasised the need for interventions to relieve anxiety surrounding the diagnosis and possible treatment side effects. Tailored 'disease-specific' support is essential to ensure efficacious treatment.

        "Abstract":"AIMS: Edoxaban is a non-vitamin K antagonist oral anticoagulant (NOAC) widely used for the long-term prevention of stroke in patients with non-valvular atrial fibrillation (NVAF). Adherence to NOAC therapy has been unsatisfactory and decreases over time. Remedial strategies are currently used to address the non-adherence events. Current recommendations, however, are generic and not well supported by evidence. The aim of this study was to explore appropriate remedial dosing regimens for non-adherent edoxaban-treated NVAF patients through Monte Carlo simulation.\nMETHODS: Six regimens were compared with the current recommendations of the European Heart Rhythm Association (EHRA) guide based on total deviation time. Both edoxaban plasma concentration and intrinsic Factor Xa activity were considered. Monte Carlo simulations were performed using RxODE based on a published population pharmacokinetic\/pharmacodynamic (PK\/PD) model.\nRESULTS: The proposed remedial strategies were different than the EHRA recommendations and were related to the delay time. However, it was found that the missed dose can be administered immediately if the delay time is within 11 h. When the delay is between 12 and 19 h, a half dose followed by a regular dosing schedule is recommended. When the delay time exceeds 19 h, a full dose followed by a half dose is preferred.\nCONCLUSION: PK\/PD modelling and simulation are effective in developing and evaluating the remedial strategies of edoxaban, which can help maximise its therapeutic effect.",

We evaluated the risk-benefit balance of antithrombotic therapy according to kidney function.\nMETHODS: In 4456 patients, the CKD-EPI (Chronic Kidney Disease Epidemiology Collaboration) formula was used to calculate baseline estimated glomerular filtration rate (eGFR). The effect of apixaban versus vitamin K antagonists and aspirin versus placebo was assessed across kidney function categories by using Cox models. The primary outcome was International Society on Thrombosis and Haemostasis major or clinically relevant nonmajor bleeding. Secondary outcomes included death or hospitalization and ischemic events (death, stroke, myocardial infarction, stent thrombosis [definite or probable], or urgent revascularization).

At the 6-month follow-up, a total of 543 primary outcomes of bleeding, 1125 death or hospitalizations, and 282 ischemic events occurred.

The absolute risk reduction with apixaban was most pronounced in those with an eGFR of 30 to 50 mL·min·1.73 m for bleeding events with rates of 13.1% versus 21.3% (hazard ratio, 0.59; 95% CI, 0.41-0.84). Patients assigned aspirin had a higher risk of bleeding in all eGFR categories with an even greater increase among those with eGFR >80 mL·min·1.73 m: 16.6% versus 5.6% (hazard ratio, 3.22; 95% CI, 2.19-4.74;  for interaction=0.007). The risk of death or hospitalization and ischemic events were comparable to aspirin and placebo across eGFR categories with hazard ratios ranging from 0.97 (95% CI, 0.76-1.23) to 1.28 (95% CI, 1.02-1.59) and from 0.75 (95% CI, 0.48-1.17) to 1.34 (95% CI, 0.81-2.22), respectively.\nCONCLUSIONS: The safety and efficacy of apixaban was consistent irrespective of kidney function, compared with warfarin, and in accordance with the overall trial results. The risk of bleeding with aspirin was consistently higher across all kidney function categories. Registration: URL: https:\/\/www.clinicaltrials.gov; Unique identifier: NCT02415400.",

        "Abstract":"Inappropriate direct acting oral anti-coagulants (DOAC) prescribing increases the risk of adverse events. Population health management tools (PMTs) could help reduce adverse events through the early, efficient identification of questionable prescribing practices, but the impact of such a tool remains unknown. We evaluated the effect of PMT use on questionable DOAC dosing rates within 40 VHA medical centers and whether this effect differed by DOAC indication or agent. Medical centers were divided into PMT user or standard of care (SOC) groups based upon high or low tool access in the prior year. Questionable DOAC dosing rate was defined as the proportion of patients prescribed DOACs who were also flagged by the tool. Chi-square tests were used to determine if PMT user versus SOC groups differed with high (above 15.3%) versus low (below 15.3%) questionable dosing rates. T-tests were used to determine if mean questionable dosing rates significantly differed between the PMT user and SOC groups. DOAC PMT users were classified less frequently as being 'High\" questionable dosage rate compared to SOCs (25% PMT vs. 75% SOC, respectively, p = 0.002). DOAC PMT utilization within the overall cohort was associated with a 4.3% absolute reduction in questionable DOAC dosing rates (13.2% PMT vs 17.5% SOC; p = 0.01). Tool use within the atrial fibrillation (AF) subgroup was associated with a 5.1% absolute reduction in questionable dosing rates (10.4% SOC vs. 5.3% PMT, p < 0.001). Tool use was also associated with lower questionable dosing rates in the apixaban (p < 0.001), dabigatran (p = 0.03) and AF plus venous thromboembolism (p < 0.001) subgroups. In our study, PMT use was associated with reduced questionable DOAC dosing, a difference most pronounced within AF patients. A population health approach has the potential to reduce adverse events among patients prescribed DOACs.",

        "Abstract":"BACKGROUND: Because of a lack of comparative data on anticoagulant use in the advanced chronic kidney disease (CKD) population, guidelines recommend warfarin for atrial fibrillation and venous thromboembolism (VTE) treatment in these patients. However, apixaban has specific dosing recommendations in CKD leading to use in clinical practice.\nOBJECTIVE: To evaluate major bleeding, stroke, and thromboembolism rates in patients with CKD stage 4, stage 5, and dialysis on apixaban or warfarin therapy.\nMETHODS: This was a retrospective cohort study of patients with advanced CKD receiving apixaban or warfarin. The primary outcome was the occurrence of major bleeding at 3 months after enrollment. Secondary outcomes included occurrence of major bleeding, occurrence of ischemic stroke, and recurrence of VTE at 3 to 6 and 6 to 12 months.\nRESULTS: A total of 604 patients were included in the analysis. The percentage of apixaban and warfarin patients with a major bleed at 0 to 3, 3 to 6, and 6 to 12 months were 8.3% versus 9.9% ( P=0.48), 1.4% versus 4% ( P=0.07), and 1.5% versus 8.4% ( P<0.001), respectively. There were no differences in rates of ischemic stroke or recurrent VTE at any time period. Conclusion and Relevance: Patients with advanced CKD taking apixaban had similar bleeding rates at 3 months compared with those taking warfarin. However, those who continued therapy had higher major bleeding rates with warfarin between 6 and 12 months. This study provides knowledge on the effects of a direct oral anticoagulant in a population that was excluded from all major trials.",

        "Abstract":"BACKGROUND: Compared with the general population, patients with advanced chronic kidney disease have a >10-fold higher burden of atrial fibrillation. Limited data are available guiding the use of nonvitamin K antagonist oral anticoagulants in this population.\nMETHODS: We compared the safety of apixaban with warfarin in 269 patients with atrial fibrillation and advanced chronic kidney disease (defined as creatinine clearance [CrCl] 25 to 30 mL\/min) enrolled in the ARISTOTLE trial (Apixaban for Reduction in Stroke and Other Thromboembolic Events in Atrial Fibrillation). Cox proportional models were used to estimate hazard ratios for major bleeding and major or clinically relevant nonmajor bleeding. We characterized the pharmacokinetic profile of apixaban by assessing differences in exposure using nonlinear mixed effects models.\nRESULTS: Among patients with CrCl 25 to 30 mL\/min, apixaban caused less major bleeding (hazard ratio, 0.34 [95% CI, 0.14-0.80]) and major or clinically relevant nonmajor bleeding (hazard ratio, 0.35 [95% CI, 0.17-0.72]) compared with warfarin. Patients with CrCl 25 to 30 mL\/min randomized to apixaban demonstrated a trend toward lower rates of major bleeding when compared with those with CrCl >30 mL\/min ( interaction=0.08) and major or clinically relevant nonmajor bleeding ( interaction=0.05). Median daily steady-state areas under the curve for apixaban 5 mg twice daily were 5512 ng\/(mL·h) and 3406 ng\/(mL·h) for patients with CrCl 25 to 30 mL\/min or >30 mL\/min, respectively. For apixaban 2.5 mg twice daily, the median exposure was 2780 ng\/(mL·h) for patients with CrCl 25 to 30 mL\/min. The area under the curve values for patients with CrCl 25 to 30 mL\/min fell within the ranges demonstrated for patients with CrCl >30 mL\/min.\nCONCLUSIONS: Among patients with atrial fibrillation and CrCl 25 to 30 mL\/min, apixaban caused less bleeding than warfarin, with even greater reductions in bleeding than in patients with CrCl >30 mL\/min. We observed substantial overlap in the range of exposure to apixaban 5 mg twice daily for patients with or without advanced chronic kidney disease, supporting conventional dosing in patients with CrCl 25 to 30 mL\/min. Randomized, controlled studies evaluating the safety and efficacy of apixaban are urgently needed in patients with advanced chronic kidney disease, including those receiving dialysis.

        "Abstract":"AIMS: Elderly atrial fibrillation (AF) patients with risk factors of bleeding are often considered ineligible for standard oral anticoagulants (OACs). The Edoxaban Low-Dose for EldeR CARE AF patients (ELDERCARE-AF) trial recently showed that edoxaban 15 mg\/day was superior to placebo for preventing stroke or systemic embolism and did not result in a significantly higher incidence of major bleeding. Our aim was to investigate a real-world cohort of AF patients similar to the ELDERCARE-AF cohort, with regard to the impact of direct oral anticoagulant (DOAC) use compared to non-OAC use, in relation to clinical outcomes.\nMETHODS AND RESULTS: From 1 January 2012 to 31 December 2016, 15 183 AF patients aged ≥80 years (mean age 86.63 years [SD 4.79]; 48.7% male) with a congestive heart failure, hypertension, age ≥75 years, diabetes mellitus, and prior stroke or transient ischemic attack (CHADS2) score ≥2 who met the enrolment criteria (generally similar to ELDERCARE-AF) were identified from the Taiwan National Health Insurance Research Database. Patients were categorized into two groups according to their stroke prevention strategies, i.e. without OACs (n = 9084) and DOACs (n = 6099). Patients receiving DOACs were further stratified into reduced-dose- or full-dose-regimen groups. Compared with the non-OAC group as a reference, DOAC use (whether at reduced dose or full dose) was associated with a lower risk of ischaemic stroke (adjusted hazard ratio [aHR] 0.77, 95% confidence interval [CI] 0.67-0.88) and all-cause mortality (aHR 0.39, 95% CI 0.37-0.42), while the risks of intracranial haemorrhage and major bleeding were similar. The risks of composite outcomes of 'ischaemic stroke or mortality' (aHR 0.42, 95% CI 0.40-0.45) and 'ischaemic stroke or major bleeding or mortality' (aHR 0.49, 95% CI 0.46-0.52) were significantly lower with DOAC use. When compared with the non-OAC group as the reference group, DOACs (whether reduced dose or full dose) showed a positive net clinical benefit. The results were generally consistent even after propensity matching.\nCONCLUSION: In routine clinical care, DOACs (whether reduced or full dose) were associated with a lower risk of ischaemic stroke, mortality, and the composite endpoint, when compared with non-OAC use in high-risk elderly AF patients at increased bleeding risk. Our findings provide complementary 'real-world' data to support the generalizability of the results of the ELDERCARE-AF trial to other DOACs in daily clinical practice.",

        "Abstract":"['2', '2', '2', '2']\nOral anticoagulants are essential drugs for the prevention of thromboembolic events in patients with atrial fibrillation (AF). Anticoagulants are, however, commonly withheld in older people due to the risk and fear of hemorrhage. Although the underutilization of anticoagulants in patients with AF has been demonstrated internationally, few studies have been conducted among aged care residents. The aim of this study was to determine the utilization of anticoagulants among people with AF residing in aged care facilities. We performed a non-experimental, retrospective analysis designed to evaluate antithrombotic usage in patients with AF in Australia residing in aged care facilities, using data collected by pharmacists while performing Residential Medication Management Reviews (RMMRs). The utilization of antithrombotic therapy and the appropriateness of therapy were determined based on the CHADS, CHADS-VASc, and HAS-BLED risk stratification schemes in consideration of documented contraindications to treatment. Predictors of anticoagulant use were determined using multivariate logistic regression. A total of 1952 RMMR patients with AF were identified. Only 35.6% of eligible patients (CHADS score ≥2 and no contraindications to anticoagulants) received an anticoagulant. As age increased, the likelihood of receiving an anticoagulant decreased and the likelihood of receiving an antiplatelet or no therapy increased. In patients at high risk of stroke (CHADS score ≥2), utilization of anticoagulants dropped by 19.7% when the HAS-BLED score increased from 2 to 3, suggesting that physicians placed a heavier weighting on bleeding risk rather than stroke risk. Prescribing of anticoagulants was influenced to a greater extent by bleeding risk than it was by the risk of stroke. Further research investigating whether the growing availability of direct oral anticoagulants influences practice in this patient population is needed.",

However, anticoagulation therapy is terminated before catheter ablation (CA) of atrial fibrillation (AF) concerning adverse bleeding events. Little is known whether uninterrupted direct oral anticoagulants (DOACs) during perioperative period of CA could render the ablation procedure safer and reduce the incidence of CEs compared to interrupted DOACs.

However, subsequent changes from appropriate DOAC doses to \"unintended\" inappropriate low-dose DOAC (ILD) due to increased body weight (BW) or decreased serum creatinine concentration might be overlooked. We investigated outcomes in patients receiving appropriate DOAC, \"intended\" ILD, or unintended ILD, to determine the optimal review time for DOAC doses and associated factors.\nMETHODS: This single-center, retrospective cohort study included inpatients receiving apixaban for stroke prevention between August 2015 and July 2017. Primary outcome was whether starting DOAC dose was selected according to manufacturer's recommendations and whether that dose remained appropriate thereafter. Secondary outcome was the incidence of recurrent ischemic stroke and intracranial bleeding during therapy. Average rates of change in BW, creatinine, and creatinine clearance (CrCl) were evaluated after hospitalization every 10 ± 3 days.\nRESULTS: During the study period, 120 patients received apixaban; 112 (93.3%) commenced appropriate DOAC doses, and 8 (6.7%) commenced intended ILD doses. Of the 112 patients on appropriate DOAC doses, 7 (6.3%) changed to unintended ILD doses because of increased BW (n = 4) or decreased creatinine (n = 3). The rate of recurrent ischemic stroke differed significantly between the appropriate DOAC dose and the intended or unintended ILD dose group (1.9% [2 of 105] versus 20.0% [3 of 15], P = .014).

        "Abstract":"INTRODUCTION: The coagulopathy of cirrhosis is complex, placing patients at risk for both bleeding and thrombosis. Direct oral anticoagulants (DOACs) have equivalent or superior efficacy and safety as compared to vitamin K antagonists (VKAs); however, their efficacy and safety in liver cirrhosis has not been studied. To better define this, we evaluated outcomes of patients with cirrhosis prescribed DOACs compared to other anticoagulants at our center.\nMETHODS: Retrospective cohort study of patients with cirrhosis prescribed therapeutic anticoagulation over a 3-year period for thrombosis or prevention of stroke in patients with atrial fibrillation. The primary outcomes of interest were bleeding events and recurrent thrombosis or stroke.\nRESULTS: During the study period, 27 patients with cirrhosis were prescribed a DOAC and 18 were prescribed VKA or low molecular weight heparin (LMWH). Both groups had similar total bleeding events (8 DOAC vs 10 other, P=.12). There were significantly less major bleeding episodes in the DOAC group (1 [4%] vs 5 [28%], P=.03). Recurrent thrombosis occurred in one patient receiving a DOAC (4%) and one patient (6%) receiving other anticoagulation (P=1.0).\nCONCLUSIONS: Direct oral anticoagulant use in patients with cirrhosis may be as safe as traditional anticoagulants. Patients with cirrhosis at our center prescribed DOACs had less major bleeding events, while maintaining efficacy at preventing stroke or thrombosis.",

        "Abstract":"OBJECTIVE: The objective of this study was to assess the cost effectiveness of direct-acting oral anticoagulants for stroke prevention in Thai patients with non-valvular atrial fibrillation and a HAS-BLED score of 3.\nMETHODS: Total costs (US$) in 2017 and quality-adjusted life-years were estimated over 20 years using a Markov model. A base-case analysis was conducted under a societal perspective, which included direct healthcare, non-healthcare and indirect costs in Thailand. Clinical events for warfarin and utilities were obtained from Thai patients whenever possible. The efficacy of direct-acting oral anticoagulants was derived from trial-based East Asian subgroups and adjusted for time in the target international normalized ratio range of warfarin.\nRESULTS: In the base case, use of apixaban instead of warfarin incurred an additional cost of US$20,763 per quality-adjusted life-year gained. Substituting apixaban with rivaroxaban and rivaroxaban with high-dose edoxaban would incur an additional cost per quality-adjusted life-year by US$507 and US$434, respectively. Compared with warfarin, high-dose edoxaban had the lowest incremental cost-effectiveness ratio of US$9704\/quality-adjusted life-year, followed by high-dose dabigatran (incremental cost-effectiveness ratio US$11,155\/quality-adjusted life-year). The incremental cost-effectiveness ratios based on a payer perspective were similar. The incremental cost-effectiveness ratio was below Thailand's cost-effectiveness threshold when high-dose dabigatran and edoxaban prices were reduced by 50%. Changes in key parameters had a minimal impact on incremental cost-effectiveness ratios.\nCONCLUSIONS: For both societal and payer perspectives, high-dose edoxaban with a price below the country cost-effectiveness threshold should be the first anticoagulant option for Thai patients with non-valvular atrial fibrillation and a high risk of bleeding.",

        "Published":"2023-01-06",
        "Abstract":"Direct oral anticoagulants (DOACs) used in nonvalvular atrial fibrillation (NVAF) are dose-reduced in elderly and patients with impaired renal function. Only reduced dose dabigatran is concluded as having similar stroke risk reduction and lower risk of major bleeding than warfarin in the pivotal studies. In clinical practice, reduced dose is prescribed more often than expected making this an important issue. The objective of this study was to compare effectiveness and safety between reduced dose DOACs and high TTR warfarin treatment (TTR ≥ 70%) in NVAF. A Swedish anticoagulation registry was used in identifying eligible patients from July 2011 to December 2017. The study cohort consisted of 40,564 patients with newly initiated DOAC (apixaban, dabigatran, or rivaroxaban) (11,083 patients) or warfarin treatment (29,481 patients) after exclusion of 374,135 patients due to not being warfarin or DOAC naïve, not being prescribed reduced dose, having previous mechanical heart valve (MHV), or being under 18 years old. The median durations of follow up were 365, 419, 432 and 473 days for apixaban, dabigatran, rivaroxaban and warfarin, respectively. Warfarin TTR identified from Auricula was 70.0%. Endpoints (stroke and major bleeding) and baseline characteristics were collected from hospital administrative registers using ICD-10 codes. Cohorts were compared using weighted adjusted Cox regression after full optimal matching based on propensity scores. DOACs are associated with lower risk of major bleeding (HR with 95% CI) 0.85 (0.78-0.93), intracranial bleeding HR 0.64 (0.51-0.80), hemorrhagic stroke HR 0.68 (0.50-0.92), gastrointestinal bleeding HR 0.81 (0.69-0.96) and all-cause stroke HR 0.87 (0.76-0.99), than warfarin. Apixaban and dabigatran are associated with lower risk of major bleeding, HR 0.70 (0.63-0.78) and HR 0.80 (0.69-0.94), and rivaroxaban is associated with lower risk of ischemic stroke, HR 0.73 (0.59-0.96), with higher major bleeding risk, HR 1.31 (1.15-1.48), compared to warfarin. Apixaban is associated with higher all-cause mortality compared to warfarin, HR 1.12 (1.03-1.21). DOACs are associated with lower risk of major bleeding and all-cause stroke, than high quality warfarin treatment, with exception of rivaroxaban that carried higher risk of major bleeding and lower risk of stroke or systemic embolism. In this large observational registry-based NVAF cohort, DOACs are preferred treatment in patients with indication for DOAC dose reduction, even in a high TTR setting.",

        "Abstract":"BACKGROUND: Few geriatric patients were included in studies on direct oral anticoagulants and data on dabigatran concentration and safety are needed in this population. Our objectives were to evaluate peak and trough dabigatran plasma concentrations over time in a geriatric population and to identify factors associated with dabigatran plasma concentrations and to assess the relationship with bleeding events.\nMETHODS: Peak and trough dabigatran plasma concentration were performed 4,8,15,30,45 days after inception of dabigatran treatment in 68 consecutive patients ≥75 years old hospitalized in a geriatric hospital with atrial fibrillation. Bleeding events were monitored for 1 year.\nRESULTS: Mean age was 85.8(5.1) years old and 76.5% were women. Overall, 541 dabigatran plasma measurements (270 peak, 271 trough) were performed. Mean dabigatran concentrations of the 5 sequential measurements ranged 106-146ng\/mL for peak and 66-84ng\/mL for trough. Renal failure was associated with high peak and trough dabigatran concentration. Inter- and intra-individual coefficients of variation were 59.5% and 44.7% for peak and 74.5% and 44.6% for trough. Participants in the lower two tertiles of dabigatran concentration at day 8 (D8) remained below the 90th percentile (243.9ng\/ml) on the next measurements. Bleeding events were associated with high trough dabigatran concentrations. Trough dabigatran concentration at D8>243.9ng\/mL significantly predicted bleeding.\nCONCLUSION: In this geriatric population, renal function and low albumin were associated with dabigatran concentrations. Despite large variability, participants in the lower two tertiles of dabigatran concentration at D8 remained below the 90th percentile on the following measurements. D8 dabigatran trough concentration≥243.9ng\/mL identified patients at risk of bleeding.",
