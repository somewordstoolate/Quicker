According to the Cochrane's handbook, Cohen suggested that SMD=0.2 be considered a 'small' effect size, 0.5 represents a 'medium' effect size and 0.8 a 'large' effect size. This means that if two groups' means do not differ by 0.2 standard deviations or more, the difference is trivial, even if it is statistically significant.",
