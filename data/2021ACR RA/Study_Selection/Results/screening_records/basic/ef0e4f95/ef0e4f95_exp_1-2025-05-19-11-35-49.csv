39893489,Predicting abatacept retention using machine learning.,2025-02-01,"BACKGROUND: The incorporation of machine learning is becoming more prevalent in the clinical setting. By predicting clinical outcomes, machine learning can provide clinicians with a valuable tool for refining precision medicine approaches and improving treatment outcomes.
METHODS: This was a post hoc analysis of pooled patient-level data from the global, real-world ACTION and ASCORE trials in patients with rheumatoid arthritis (RA) initiating abatacept. Patient demographic and disease characteristics were input across 10 machine learning models used to predict 12-month treatment retention. Retention was defined as treatment for > 365 days or ≤ 365 days in patients who achieved remission or major clinical response (based on European Alliance of Associations for Rheumatology response criteria). The pooled dataset was split into a training/validation cohort for model development and a test cohort for an unbiased evaluation of performance. SHapley Additive exPlanation (SHAP) values determined the level of importance and directionality for key patient features predicting abatacept retention.
RESULTS: The pooled ACTION and ASCORE dataset included 5320 patients with RA (mean [standard deviation] age 57.7 [12.7] years; 79% female). The 12-month abatacept retention rate was 61% (n = 3236) with a discontinuation rate of 39% (n = 2037). In the training set (n = 4218), the gradient-boosting classifier model demonstrated the best performance (testing accuracy: 62%). This model had an area under the receiver operating characteristic curve (95% confidence interval) of 0.620 (0.586, 0.653) and F1 score of 0.659 (0.625, 0.689) in the test set of patients (n = 1055). Using this model, the five most important variables predicting 12-month abatacept retention were low body mass index (BMI), low American College of Rheumatology functional status class, anti-citrullinated protein antibody (ACPA) positivity, low Patient Global Assessment, and younger age.
CONCLUSIONS: The gradient-boosting classifier model identified key patient features predictive of abatacept retention from this large, real-world study population. The SHAP values conveyed the directionality and importance of BMI, functional status, ACPA serostatus, Patient Global Assessment, and age for abatacept retention. Findings are consistent with previous observations and help validate the machine learning approach for predictive modelling in RA treatment, and may help inform clinical decision making.

39718182,Sustained DMARD-free remission in subgroups of patients with rheumatoid arthritis: an analysis of two prospective cohorts with early arthritis.,2024-12-20,"BACKGROUND: About 20% of patients with rheumatoid arthritis on disease-modifying antirheumatic drugs (DMARDs) can reach sustained DMARD-free remission. Nonetheless, the 2022 EULAR recommendations discourage complete cessation of DMARDs due to flare risk. The evidence behind this recommendation is obtained from trial populations using biological DMARDs, representing only a subgroup of the total population of patients with rheumatoid arthritis. We hypothesised that patients requiring biological DMARDs represent a subgroup that is less capable of reaching sustained DMARD-free remission compared with patients not requiring a biological DMARD.
METHODS: In this study we used data from two prospectively followed up populations of patients with early rheumatoid arthritis, the Leiden Early Arthritis Clinic (EAC) and the treatment in the Rotterdam Early Arthritis Cohort (tREACH), a treat-to-target steered trial in which biological DMARDs were started when patients had inadequate response to triple DMARD-therapy (methotrexate, sulfasalazine, and hydroxychloroquine). Patient partners were involved in the design of both the EAC and tREACH. The primary outcome was sustained DMARD-free remission, which was defined as absence of clinical synovitis after discontinuation of DMARDs for at least 1 year. Patients who did or did not receive biological DMARDs in 5 years (EAC) or 3 years (tREACH) were compared using Kaplan-Meier curves.
FINDINGS: 627 patients from the EAC were included, of whom 391 (62%) were female and 236 (38%) were male. The mean age was 60 years (SD 14) and 502 (95%) of 529 patients were White. 89 (14%) of 627 patients had ever used a biological DMARD and 538 (86%) had never used a biological DMARD. None of the patients that used a biological DMARD reached sustained DMARD-free remission, whereas 37% of the patients who never used a biological DMARD reached sustained DMARD-free remission at 5 years (hazard ratio [HR] 0·02, 95% CI 0·00-0·10; p<0·0001). From the tREACH population, 425 patients were included in the study. 286 (67%) patients were female, 139 (33%) were male, and the mean age was 54 years (SD 14); ethnicity data not recorded. 154 (36%) of 425 patients had ever used a biological DMARD and 271 (64%) had never used a biological DMARD during follow-up. None of the patients that used a biological DMARD reached sustained DMARD-free remission, whereas 15% of patients who never used a biological DMARD reached sustained DMARD-free remission at 3 years (HR 0·03, 95% CI 0·00-0·21; p<0·0001).
INTERPRETATION: For the subgroup of patients with rheumatoid arthritis who require biological DMARDs, sustained DMARD-free remission does not seem attainable. In contrast, in patients with rheumatoid arthritis who do not require biological DMARDs, DMARD-free remission is attainable. These data suggest that the current EULAR recommendation to not stop DMARD use might suffer from ascertainment bias. Future recommendations about DMARD cessation should be amended.

39690760,[Application status of methotrexate in patients with rheumatoid arthritis].,,"OBJECTIVE: To investigate the current status of methotrexate (MTX) application in rheumatoid arthritis (RA) patients.
METHODS: The clinical and laboratory data of RA patients who attended in the Department of Rheumatology and Immunology of Peking University Third Hospital from January 1, 2022 to November 31, 2023 were collected retrospectively. In order to figure out the relationship between MTX use and RA disease control, we recorded information including the starting dose, maximum dose, current dose, reasons of discontinuation of MTX, . The  test, Mann-Whitney  test, Chi-square test, Fisher' s exact probability and multivariable Logistic regression were used for analysis.
RESULTS: A total of 239 RA patients were enrolled, including 201 females and 38 males with a mean age of (54.5±14.3) years. Among them, 101 patients reached the therapeutic target [clinical remission or low disease activity assessed by 28-joint disease activity score (DAS28)-erythrocyte sedimentation rate (ESR)], accounting for 42.2% of the RA patients. Twenty-six patients met the European League Against Rheumatism (EULAR) definition of difficult-to-treat (D2T) RA, accounting for 10.9% of RA patients. The proportion of the RA patients who had ever used MTX was 84. 1%, and those who were currently on it accounted for only 39.7%. The MTX dose was generally low, with a starting dose of (9.5±3.0) mg/week, the maximum dose of 15.0 (10.0, 15.0) mg/week, and the current dose being (12.4±2.7) mg/week. The most common reasons for MTX dose reduction or discontinuation were adverse reactions, mainly including abnormalities of hepatic function, gastrointestinal discomfort, leucopenia,  Those who were currently on MTX had a higher rate of treatment to target (52.6%  35.4%, 0.05), lower disease activity score (DAS28-ESR, 3.6±1.8  4.2±1.8,  < 0.05), and fewer tender joint counts (4.8±8.3  8.6±10.4,  < 0.05) as compared with those who were not taking the drug, while swollen joint count, pain visual analog score and patient' s global score, C-reactive protein (CRP) level and ESR level were not significantly different between the two groups. Compared with those who did not reach the target of treatment, those who did had a higher rate of current MTX application (48.5%  33.3%,  < 0.05), but the history of MTX did not differ between the two groups (84.2%  84.1%, >0.05). The maximum dose of MTX (median 15.0 mg/week  13.7 mg/week, >0.05) and the current dose [(12.9±2.5) mg/week  (11.8±2.8) mg/week, >0.05] was higher in those who achieved the target, while the starting dose [(9.6±2.8) mg/week  (9.5±3.1) mg/week, >0.05] and the rate of prior MTX (84.2%  83.3%, >0.05) was comparable between the two groups. The D2T RA patients had a higher rate of previous MTX use (96.2%  82.6%,  < 0.05) and a higher starting dose [(11.6±4.3) mg/week  (9.8±2.7) mg/week, >0.05], while the maximum dose (median 12.5 mg/week  15.0 mg/week, >0.05) and the current dose were both lower [(11.6±3.2) mg/week  (12.5±2.6) mg/week, >0.05] than the non-D2T RA patients.
CONCLUSION: The proportion of regular use of MTX among RA patients was low and the dose was generally small. The RA patients with regular use of MTX had a higher rate of achieving treatment target and lower disease activity. Those who achieved the target had a higher rate of current MTX use, higher maximum and current doses than those who did not. The D2T RA patients had lower maximum and current doses of MTX than the non-D2T RA patients.

METHODS: We included RA patients initiating a JAKi between 2018 and 2022. Patients meeting EULAR criteria for D2TRA were compared to active non-D2TRA patients. Efficacy was evaluated at the first visit (FV) (6 months following JAKi initiation) and the last available visit (LV) up to December 2022.
RESULTS: 45 patients with D2TRA, all presenting signs of disease activity (imaging, CRP levels), were compared to 29 active non-D2TRA. DAS28 and DAS28-CRP reduction from baseline to FV was significant and similar between both groups, before and after adjusting for several factors including the number and exposure duration to previous targeted therapies. DAS28 and DAS28-CRP remained stable in both groups between FV and LV. The proportion of responders and patients achieving remission or low disease activity at FV and LV was similar in both groups. Thirty-five patients (42 %) discontinued JAKi over a mean observation period of 20±10 months, with no significant difference in discontinuation rates between groups (p = 0.36). Discontinuations due to inefficacy and side effects were evenly distributed. Frequency of infections, herpes zoster, myocardial infarctions, and venous thromboembolism was similar between groups, with a higher likelihood in patients aged ≥65 years and/or with at least one cardiovascular risk factor (30/39, 77 %).

39509293,Precision Dosing of Intravenous Tocilizumab: Development of Pharmacokinetic Model-Derived Tapering Strategies for Patients With Rheumatoid Arthritis.,2024-11-07,"BACKGROUND: Tocilizumab targets the interleukin-6 receptor, and dosing is complex owing to its nonlinear clearance related to target binding. Therefore, tapering tocilizumab requires a different approach than that of tumor necrosis factor inhibitors (TNFi). This study aimed to identify these differences and enable personalized treatment of rheumatoid arthritis (RA) beyond TNFi therapy.
METHODS: A population pharmacokinetic model of intravenous tocilizumab was developed using data from a randomized controlled trial of dose tapering in patients with RA. Subsequent population-level Monte Carlo and individual Bayesian simulations were performed to create tapering strategies involving dose reduction and interval extension. The target trough concentration of tocilizumab was 5 mg/L. Finally, the drug savings were compared between the 2 methods.
RESULTS: The pharmacokinetic of tocilizumab was described with a 2-compartment model with parallel linear (CL 0.20 L/d) and nonlinear (V M 5.2 mg/d, K M 0.19 mg/L) elimination. The linear clearance rate and central volume of distribution increased with lean body mass, and men exhibited higher clearance rates than women. The simulated concentration-time profiles demonstrated that, owing to nonlinear clearance, drug concentrations decreased more than dose-proportionally with lower doses. Tapering based on an individual Bayesian approach emerged as the most promising strategy, yielding a 39% reduction in drug use across virtual populations.
CONCLUSIONS: Tapering strategies were developed for intravenous tocilizumab, offering potential application in patients with RA who have reached low disease activity or remission, pending clinical validation. The developed strategies demonstrate that the tapering of tocilizumab should be approached more carefully and in smaller steps than that of TNFi.",10.1097/FTD.0000000000001258,"['Journal Article', 'Randomized Controlled Trial']","Title: Precision Dosing of Intravenous Tocilizumab: Development of Pharmacokinetic Model-Derived Tapering Strategies for Patients With Rheumatoid Arthritis.
Abstract: BACKGROUND: Tocilizumab targets the interleukin-6 receptor, and dosing is complex owing to its nonlinear clearance related to target binding. Therefore, tapering tocilizumab requires a different approach than that of tumor necrosis factor inhibitors (TNFi).

39243280,Real-world study comparing the efficacy of Janus kinase inhibitors in patients with difficult-to-treat rheumatoid arthritis.,2024-09-07,"OBJECTIVE: This study aimed to analyze the clinical efficacy of JAK inhibitors in difficult-to-treat rheumatoid arthritis (D2TRA) and non-D2TRA patients and evaluate the factors influencing their efficacy using real-world data.
METHOD: Here, 159 JAK inhibitor-treated patients with rheumatoid arthritis were categorized into D2TRA and non-D2TRA groups. Data including the Clinical Disease Activity Index (CDAI) at initiation and 6 months after drug administration, drug retention months, and reason for discontinuation due to toxic adverse events were collected.
RESULTS: The retention rates at 6 months were 64.0% (D2TRA) and 78.4% (non-D2TRA) and were significantly different between the two groups (p = 0.030). The discontinuation rate owing to toxic adverse events significantly differed between the two groups (p = 0.030). The CDAI-low disease activity (LDA) rates differed significantly between the two groups (non-D2TRA, 62.3%; D2TRA, 34%; p < 0.001).

39198040,A retrospective study of efficacy of tofacitinib combined with bDMARDs in the treatment of rheumatoid arthritis patients with inadequate response to bDMARDs.,,"INTRODUCTION: Rheumatoid arthritis (RA) is a chronic systemic autoimmune disease characterized by synovial inflammation, joint swelling, and pain involving multiple joints. While biologic disease-modifying antirheumatic drugs (bDMARDs) and targeted synthetic DMARDs (tsDMARDs) are popular treatments for RA, there is limited research on their combined use. This study examined a cohort of RA patients who demonstrated inadequate response to bDMARDs and subsequently initiated combination therapy with tofacitinib and bDMARDs, assessing both the efficacy and safety profile of this therapeutic approach.
METHODS: In this study, we retrospectively collected the electronic medical records (EMR) of 62 adult patients with RA who were admitted to the Fourth Affiliated Hospital Zhejiang University School of Medicine between August 2018 and December 2022. All patients had received at least one bDMARD treatment for more than 3 months and still exhibited moderate-to-high disease activity. Tofacitinib 5 mg bid was added to their original biological treatment in 28 cases, and other 34 cases switched to another bDMARD or tsDMARD as control group. Treatment was continued for 24 weeks following the initiation of combination therapy. Changes in DAS28-ESR and ACR20, 50, 70 response rates at week 24 were collected and analyzed from baseline, while changes in C-reactive protein (CRP) and erythrocyte sedimentation rate (ESR) at weeks 4, 8, 12, 24 were also collected and analyzed.
RESULTS: After 24 weeks of treatment, the DAS28-ESR score in combined treatment group decreased significantly from a baseline of 5.26 ± 0.90 (3.87-8.31) to 2.67 ± 0.86 (1.41-5.11), with remission achieved by 19 patients (67.9%) and low disease activity achieved by five patients (17.9%). The DAS28-ESR in the control group exhibited a decrease from 5.20 ± 0.77 (3.87-7.23) at baseline to 3.25 ± 1.29 (1.54-5.69). In all, 13 patients (38.2%) achieved remission, while another 11 patients (32.4%) achieved low disease activity. The ACR20, 50, 70 response rates were 85.71%, 75%, and 39.29% in the combined treatment group, whereas it were 75.0%, 53.57%, 21.43% in the control group. Additionally, both ESR and CRP levels decreased significantly during the course of treatment without any reported adverse events leading to discontinuation.
CONCLUSION: Our findings offer some evidence, supporting the effectiveness and safety of combining bDMARD with JAKi tofacitinib in RA patients who have an inadequate response to bDMARD monotherapy.

39196526,Efficacy and Safety of Levilimab in Combination with Methotrexate in Patients with Active Rheumatoid Arthritis: 56-Week Results of Phase III Randomized Double-Blind Placebo-Controlled Trial SOLAR.,2024-08-28,"UNLABELLED: . Previously, 24-week results of phase III double-blind, placebo-controlled randomized clinical study (SOLAR) of levilimab in subjects with active rheumatoid arthritis (RA) proved a superiority of levilimab over placebo. Here, we present 1-year efficacy and safety data of the SOLAR study.
OBJECTIVES: . To evaluate the efficacy and safety of levilimab in combination with methotrexate (MTX) in subjects with MTX resistant active RA.
MATERIALS AND METHODS: : The study was conducted at 21 clinical sites in Russia and Belarus. All randomized subjects have completed the study between November 2019 and October 2021. Adult subjects (154) aged ≥18 years with confirmed diagnosis of RA were randomly assigned (2 : 1) to receive either levilimab (162 mg, SC, QW) + MTX (n = 102) or placebo + MTX (n = 52). After W24 of the study all subjects continued to  receive open label levilimab. Subjects who have achieved DAS28-CRP ≤ 2.6 at W24 were switched to maintenance (Q2W) regimen of levilimab at W28 (LVL QW/Q2W and PBO/LVL Q2W arms). Those with DAS28-CRP > 2.6 at W28 continued with QW regimen (LVL QW and PBO/LVL QW arm). The PBO/LVL Q2W arm contained only one subject, thus not included in the analysis. The efficacy analysis was performed in a population of all randomized subjects. Those with missing data due to study discontinuation or rescue therapy prescription were considered non-responders. Otherwise, the analysis was performed on complete cases. Safety was assessed through monitoring of adverse events (AEs) in a population of those, who received at least on dose of LVL (n = 152).
RESULTS: : Better response to treatment was observed in LVL QW/Q2W as it composed of those who reach DAS28-CRP ≤ 2.6 at W24. At this time point 15/27 (55.6%) of them achieved ACR70; 23/27 (85.2%) achieved DAS28-CRP remission (<2.6) and 7/27 (25.9%) achieved ACR/EULAR2011 remission of RA. After switching to LVL Q2W, rates of ACR70 and DAS28-CRP<2.6 did not significantly changed until W52: 17/27 (63.0%) and 21/27 (77.8%), respectively, yet the proportion of subject with ACR/EULAR 2011 remission further increased and reached 12/27 (44.4%). LVL QW arm was diminished by subjects who achieved high response to treatment at W24 and composed LVL QW/Q2W arm. Thus, ACR70, and remissions rate in this arm was close to zero at W24. However, continuation of LVL QW in those who not achieved DAS28-CRP ≤ 2.6 at W24 induced ACR70 response in 37/75 (36.0%), DAS28-CRP remission in 35/75 (46.7%) and ACR/EULAR 2011 remission in 8/75 (10.7%) at W52. The most common adverse events (reported in ≥5% of subjects) were blood cholesterol increase (30.3%), ALT increase (23.0%), lymphocyte count decrease (17.1%), ANC decrease (16.4%), blood triglycerides increase (13.8%), bilirubin increase (11.2%), AST increase (9.9%), WBC decrease (9.9%), IGRA with Mycobacterium tuberculosis antigen positive (7.2%), and injection site reactions (5.9%). No deaths occurred.
CONCLUSIONS: : Open label period confirmed the lasting efficacy and safety of levilimab in combination with MTX in subjects with MTX resistant active RA and suggested the possibility of switching to levilimab maintenance regimen (once every 2 weeks) (Q2W) in those who achieved remission of RA at week 24.",10.1134/S1607672924701072,"['Journal Article', 'Randomized Controlled Trial', 'Clinical Trial, Phase III', 'Multicenter Study']","Title: Efficacy and Safety of Levilimab in Combination with Methotrexate in Patients with Active Rheumatoid Arthritis: 56-Week Results of Phase III Randomized Double-Blind Placebo-Controlled Trial SOLAR.

This study retrospectively collected 76 elderly patients (age > 60) treated with TOF from 2019 to 2023 and grouped them according to age of disease onset. Data were collected from baseline to the last follow-up visit within 24 months. The demographic characteristics and follow-up results were compared.

39075620,Upadacitinib monotherapy versus methotrexate monotherapy in patients with rheumatoid arthritis: efficacy and safety through 5 years in the SELECT-EARLY randomized controlled trial.,2024-07-29,"BACKGROUND: To evaluate the efficacy and safety of upadacitinib monotherapy versus methotrexate (MTX) monotherapy over 5 years among MTX-naïve patients with moderately to severely active rheumatoid arthritis (RA) in the long-term extension (LTE) of the phase 3 SELECT-EARLY trial.
METHODS: Patients were randomized to receive upadacitinib 15 mg or 30 mg or MTX. Patients who did not achieve CDAI remission and had < 20% improvement in tender and swollen joint counts at week 26 received rescue therapy (addition of MTX in the upadacitinib group and addition of upadacitinib in the MTX group). Efficacy assessments were evaluated over 5 years and are reported as observed (AO) for patients who received continuous monotherapy with upadacitinib 15/30 mg or MTX and by randomized group applying non-responder imputation (NRI). Treatment-emergent adverse events (TEAEs) per 100 patient-years were summarized over 5 years.
RESULTS: Of 945 patients randomized and treated, 775 (82%) completed week 48 and entered the LTE on study drug. Higher proportions of patients consistently achieved disease activity targets over 5 years with upadacitinib than MTX. In AO analyses, 53%/59% of patients attained CDAI remission with upadacitinib 15/30 mg versus 43% with MTX at week 260. NRI analyses showed better CDAI, DAS28(CRP), and ACR responses with upadacitinib relative to MTX at week 260 (all comparisons, nominal P < .001). Upadacitinib treatment also resulted in numerically greater inhibition of structural joint progression through week 260 compared to MTX. Most TEAEs, serious AEs, and AEs leading to discontinuation were numerically higher in patients receiving upadacitinib 30 mg. Rates of serious infections, herpes zoster, creatine phosphokinase elevation, nonmelanoma skin cancer, and neutropenia were numerically higher with upadacitinib than MTX. The observed safety profile of upadacitinib over 5 years was consistent with earlier trial results and integrated phase 3 safety analyses.
CONCLUSIONS: Upadacitinib showed better clinical responses versus MTX in patients with RA throughout the 5-year trial. Higher rates of several AEs were observed with upadacitinib, especially in the 30 mg group, compared to MTX. When used as monotherapy in MTX-naïve patients, the approved upadacitinib 15 mg dose showed better long-term efficacy versus MTX and an overall favorable benefit-risk profile.

Abstract: BACKGROUND: To evaluate the efficacy and safety of upadacitinib monotherapy versus methotrexate (MTX) monotherapy over 5 years among MTX-naïve patients with moderately to severely active rheumatoid arthritis (RA) in the long-term extension (LTE) of the phase 3 SELECT-EARLY trial.
METHODS: Patients were randomized to receive upadacitinib 15 mg or 30 mg or MTX. Patients who did not achieve CDAI remission and had < 20% improvement in tender and swollen joint counts at week 26 received rescue therapy (addition of MTX in the upadacitinib group and addition of upadacitinib in the MTX group). Efficacy assessments were evaluated over 5 years and are reported as observed (AO) for patients who received continuous monotherapy with upadacitinib 15/30 mg or MTX and by randomized group applying non-responder imputation (NRI). Treatment-emergent adverse events (TEAEs) per 100 patient-years were summarized over 5 years.
RESULTS: Of 945 patients randomized and treated, 775 (82%) completed week 48 and entered the LTE on study drug. Higher proportions of patients consistently achieved disease activity targets over 5 years with upadacitinib than MTX. In AO analyses, 53%/59% of patients attained CDAI remission with upadacitinib 15/30 mg versus 43% with MTX at week 260. NRI analyses showed better CDAI, DAS28(CRP), and ACR responses with upadacitinib relative to MTX at week 260 (all comparisons, nominal P < .001). Upadacitinib treatment also resulted in numerically greater inhibition of structural joint progression through week 260 compared to MTX. Most TEAEs, serious AEs, and AEs leading to discontinuation were numerically higher in patients receiving upadacitinib 30 mg. Rates of serious infections, herpes zoster, creatine phosphokinase elevation, nonmelanoma skin cancer, and neutropenia were numerically higher with upadacitinib than MTX. The observed safety profile of upadacitinib over 5 years was consistent with earlier trial results and integrated phase 3 safety analyses.
CONCLUSIONS: Upadacitinib showed better clinical responses versus MTX in patients with RA throughout the 5-year trial. Higher rates of several AEs were observed with upadacitinib, especially in the 30 mg group, compared to MTX.

This study aimed to clarify whether tocilizumab can be discontinued after achieving remission and to identify factors relevant to its successful discontinuation.
METHODS: Consecutive patients with AOSD diagnosed according to Yamaguchi's criteria from April 2012 to July 2022, who were treated with tocilizumab, were retrospectively reviewed.
RESULTS: Forty-eight patients with AOSD treated with intravenous tocilizumab, with sufficient information, were included. Thirty-eight patients (79.2%) achieved remission after 6 months of tocilizumab treatment, 12 of whom discontinued tocilizumab during remission. Within 1 year after tocilizumab discontinuation, six patients (50.0%) recurred at a mean of 5.5 months, while the other six (50.0%) remained in remission. Between the non-recurrence and recurrence groups, no difference was found in disease activity at tocilizumab discontinuation (systemic feature score, P = 0.24; ferritin, P = 0.46). While the duration of tocilizumab use was not different (P = 0.32), the interval of tocilizumab administration at tocilizumab discontinuation in the recurrence group was 21 (14-35) days, which tended to be shorter than 35 (28-53) days in the non-recurrence group (P = 0.08). Patients with prednisolone dose <7 mg/day at last tocilizumab treatment had fewer recurrences than those without (P = 0.001). After recurrence, tocilizumab was resumed in half of the patients, resulting in successful disease control.

The objective of this study is to identify predictors of flare in patients in stable b-DMARD-induced clinical remission, who did or did not follow structured b-DMARD tapering.
METHODS: Patients with RA receiving b-DMARD treatment who had achieved sustained remission according to a Disease Activity Score in 28 joints using the C-reactive protein level (DAS28-CRP) <2.6 for ≥6 months were offered tapering. Clinical, ultrasound (US) (total power Doppler [PD]/grayscale abnormalities), CD4 T cell subsets, and patient-reported outcomes (PROs) were collected at inclusion. The primary endpoint was the occurrence of flare (loss of DAS28-CRP remission) over 12 months. Logistic regression analyses identified predictors of flare. Dichotomization into high/low-risk groups was based on 80% specificity using the area under the receiving operator curve (AUROC).
RESULTS: Of 63 patients choosing tapering, 23 (37%) flared compared with 12 of 60 (20%) on stable treatment (P = 0.043). All patients who flared regained remission upon reinstating treatment. In the tapering group, flare was associated with lower regulatory T cell (Treg) (P < 0.0001) and higher CRP levels (P < 0.0001), erythrocyte sedimentation rate (P < 0.035), and inflammation-related cells (IRCs) (P = 0.054); stepwise modeling selected Tregs (odds ratio [OR] = 0.350, P = 0.004), IRCs (OR = 1.871, P = 0.007), and CRP level (OR = 1.577, P = 0.004) with 81.7% accuracy and AUROC = 0.890. In the continued therapy group, modeling retained the tender joint count, total PD, and visual analog scale pain score, with 82.1% accuracy and AUROC = 0.899.

Only 5 of 37 (13.5%) of the low-risk patients who tapered flared, which was notable compared with the continued therapy group (20% flare).
CONCLUSION: Flare on tapering b-DMARDs was predicted by lower Tregs and elevated inflammation biomarkers (IRCs/CRP level); flare on continued b-DMARDs was associated with raised pain parameters and US inflammation.

In consideration of ORAL-Surveillance trial and the new EULAR recommendations, real-world data are needed to assess Jak-Is safety and effectiveness. The multicenter study presented here aimed to evaluate effectiveness and safety of tofacitinib in a real-life cohort.
METHODS: A retrospective analysis was performed from September 2021 to December 2022. Data were collected when tofacitinib was started (T0) and after 3 (T3), 6 (T6) and 12 (T12) months of treatment. The primary objective was to analyze the efficacy and safety of tofacitinib. Safety was assessed by recording adverse events (AEs) with and without discontinuation. The secondary objective was to assess the difference between Patient-Reported Outcomes (PROs) and Physician's Global Assessment of disease activity (PhGA).
RESULTS: 122 patients were included in the study from the following rheumatology Centers: Pisa, Ancona, Florence (two Centers), Siena, and Sardinia. A statistically significant improvement in DAS-28-CRP, CDAI and SDAI score was observed at T3, T6, compared to baseline (p < 0.001). Improvement was confirmed in patients who reach T12. Patients naïve to bDMARDs showed a shorter remission time and higher remission rates. There was also a statistically significant improvement in PROs compared to baseline (p < 0.001). The improvement was rapid and was consistent with PhGA. The 12-month retention rate for tofacitinib was 89.35%. Reasons to stop tofacitinib were: insufficient response (7), gastrointestinal symptoms (2), infection (1), malignancy (1), Zoster (1), pruritus sine materia (1).
CONCLUSIONS: Tofacitinib is safe and effective in our RA cohort. It induces higher remission rates in patients naive to bDMARDs, suggesting that there may be a benefit using it as first-line therapy.

METHODS: We included patients from 13 observational registries treated with a TNF-inhibitor, abatacept or tocilizumab and with available information on the use of oral glucocorticoids. The main outcome was oral glucocorticoid withdrawal. A McNemar test was used to analyse the change in the use of glucocorticoids after 1 year. Kaplan-Meier estimates and Cox regressions, adjusted for patient, treatment, and disease characteristics, were used to evaluate glucocorticoid discontinuation in patients with glucocorticoids at baseline. Because of heterogeneity, analyses were done by registers and pooled using random-effects meta-analysis.
RESULTS: A total of 12,334 participants treated with TNF-inhibitors, 2100 with tocilizumab and 3229 with abatacept were included. At one-year, oral glucocorticoid use decreased in all treatment groups (odds ratio for stopping vs. starting of 2.19 [95% CI 1.58; 3.04] for TNF-inhibitors, 2.46 [1.39; 4.35] for tocilizumab; 1.73 [1.25; 2.21] for abatacept). Median time to glucocorticoid withdrawal was ≈2 years or more in most countries, with a gradual decrease over time.

METHODS: Patients (aged ≥ 18 years) who have been treated with SDZ ETN were categorised on the basis of prior treatment status (groups A-D): patients in clinical remission or with low disease activity under treatment with reference ETN or biosimilar ETN and switched to SDZ ETN; patients who received non-ETN targeted therapies and switched to SDZ ETN; biologic-naïve patients who started SDZ ETN after conventional therapy failure; or disease-modifying anti-rheumatic drug (DMARD)-naïve patients with RA considered suitable for treatment initiation with a biologic and started on treatment with SDZ ETN. The primary endpoint was drug persistence, defined as time from study enrolment until discontinuation of SDZ ETN treatment.
RESULTS: Of the 1466 patients recruited, 844 (57.6%) had RA, 334 (22.8%) had axSpA and 288 (19.6%) had PsA.

METHODS: This multicenter open-label noninferiority (NI) randomized clinical trial included patients with established rheumatoid arthritis in sustained remission receiving ABA or TCZ at a stable dose. Patients were randomized to treatment maintenance (M) at full dose (M-arm) or progressive injection spacing (S) driven by the Disease Activity Score in 28 joints every 3 months up to biologics discontinuation (S-arm). The primary end point was the evolution of disease activity according to the Disease Activity Score in 44 joints during the 2-year follow-up analyzed per protocol with a linear mixed-effects model, evaluated by an NI test based on the one-sided 95% confidence interval (95% CI) of the slope difference (NI margin 0.25).

METHODS: A prospective cohort of patients with RA in sustained remission or low disease activity while on stable bDMARD/tsDMARDs +/- csDMARDs for at least 6 months underwent medication tapering/stopping and was tracked for 2 years. Patients were evaluated for flares in four groups: no taper, only bDMARD/tsDMARD taper, only csDMARD taper and both csDMARD and bDMARD/tsDMARD taper.
RESULTS: The RHEUMTAP cohort included 131 patients that met eligibility criteria, of which 52 patients underwent a medication taper.

METHODS: Adults with rheumatoid arthritis (RA), axial spondyloarthritis (axSpA), psoriatic arthritis (PsA), Crohn's disease (CD), or ulcerative colitis (UC) were enrolled at 63 sites across Europe. Eligible patients received ≥ 16 weeks of routine treatment with reference adalimumab before transitioning to SB5, and were followed for 48 weeks post-transition. The primary objective was to evaluate candidate predictors (clinically relevant baseline variables with incidence ≥ 15% by indication cohort) associated with persistence on SB5 at 48 weeks post-initiation. Key primary outcome measures were persistence on SB5 (estimated by Kaplan-Meier methodology) and clinical characteristics and disease activity scores at the time of transition to SB5 treatment (baseline).
RESULTS: A total of 955 eligible patients were enrolled (RA, n = 207; axSpA, n = 127; PsA, n = 162; CD, n = 447; UC, n = 12), of whom 932 (97.6%) completed follow-up and 722 (75.6%) were still receiving SB5 at week 48. Kaplan-Meier estimates (95% confidence interval, CI) of persistence on SB5 at week 48 for RA, axSpA, PsA, and CD were 0.86 (0.80-0.90), 0.80 (0.71-0.86), 0.81 (0.74-0.86), and 0.72 (0.67-0.76), respectively. The single candidate predictor associated with probability of SB5 discontinuation before week 48 was female sex [RA, axSpA, and CD cohorts; HR (95% CI): 3.53 (1.07-11.67), 2.38 (1.11-5.14), and 2.21 (1.54-3.18), respectively]. Disease activity scores remained largely unchanged throughout the study, with proportions by cohort in remission at baseline versus week 48 being 59.2% versus 57.2%, 81.0% versus 78.0%, 94.7% versus 93.7%, and 84.0% versus 85.1% for patients with RA, axSpA, PsA, and CD, respectively. Similarly, the SB5 dosing regimen remained unchanged for the majority of patients from baseline to week 48, the most common regimen being 40 mg every 2 weeks. In total, 232 patients (24.3%) reported at least one adverse drug reaction, and most events were mild; eight patients (3.9%) in the RA cohort experienced nine serious adverse events (SAEs; two possibly related to SB5); eight patients (4.9%) in the PsA cohort experienced nine SAEs (one possibly related to SB5); 22 patients (4.9%) in the CD cohort experienced 27 SAEs (four possibly related to SB5); and no SAEs were observed in the UC cohort.
CONCLUSIONS: With the exception of female sex in RA, axSpA, and CD, none of the candidate predictors were associated with SB5 discontinuation. Persistence on SB5 was high, treatment effectiveness was maintained, and no safety signals were detected.

Kaplan-Meier estimates (95% confidence interval, CI) of persistence on SB5 at week 48 for RA, axSpA, PsA, and CD were 0.86 (0.80-0.90), 0.80 (0.71-0.86), 0.81 (0.74-0.86), and 0.72 (0.67-0.76), respectively. The single candidate predictor associated with probability of SB5 discontinuation before week 48 was female sex [RA, axSpA, and CD cohorts; HR (95% CI): 3.53 (1.07-11.67), 2.38 (1.11-5.14), and 2.21 (1.54-3.18), respectively]. Disease activity scores remained largely unchanged throughout the study, with proportions by cohort in remission at baseline versus week 48 being 59.2% versus 57.2%, 81.0% versus 78.0%, 94.7% versus 93.7%, and 84.0% versus 85.1% for patients with RA, axSpA, PsA, and CD, respectively. Similarly, the SB5 dosing regimen remained unchanged for the majority of patients from baseline to week 48, the most common regimen being 40 mg every 2 weeks. In total, 232 patients (24.3%) reported at least one adverse drug reaction, and most events were mild; eight patients (3.9%) in the RA cohort experienced nine serious adverse events (SAEs; two possibly related to SB5); eight patients (4.9%) in the PsA cohort experienced nine SAEs (one possibly related to SB5); 22 patients (4.9%) in the CD cohort experienced 27 SAEs (four possibly related to SB5); and no SAEs were observed in the UC cohort.
CONCLUSIONS: With the exception of female sex in RA, axSpA, and CD, none of the candidate predictors were associated with SB5 discontinuation. Persistence on SB5 was high, treatment effectiveness was maintained, and no safety signals were detected.

37607809,"Effect of tapered versus stable treatment with tumour necrosis factor inhibitors on disease flares in patients with rheumatoid arthritis in remission: a randomised, open label, non-inferiority trial.",2023-08-22,"OBJECTIVES: Many patients with rheumatoid arthritis (RA) require treatment with tumour necrosis factor inhibitor (TNFi) to reach remission. It is debated whether tapering of TNFi to discontinuation should be considered in sustained remission. The aim of ARCTIC REWIND TNFi was to assess the effect of tapering TNFi to withdrawal compared with stable treatment on the risk of disease activity flares in patients with RA in remission ≥1 year.
METHODS: This randomised, open-label, non-inferiority trial was undertaken at nine Norwegian rheumatology departments. Patients with RA in remission ≥12 months on stable TNFi therapy were allocated by computer-based block-randomisation to tapering to discontinuation of TNFi or stable TNFi. Conventional synthetic disease-modifying antirheumatic co-medication was unchanged. The primary endpoint was disease flare during the 12-month study period (non-inferiority margin 20%), assessed in the per-protocol population.
RESULTS: Between June 2013 and January 2019, 99 patients were enrolled and 92 received the allocated treatment strategy. Eighty-four patients were included in the per-protocol population. In the tapering TNFi group, 27/43 (63%) experienced a flare during 12 months, compared with 2/41 (5%) in the stable TNFi group; risk difference (95% CI) 58% (42% to 74%). The tapering strategy was not non-inferior to continued stable treatment. The number of total/serious adverse events was 49/3 in the tapering group, 57/2 in the stable group.
CONCLUSION: In patients with RA in remission for more than 1 year while using TNFi, an increase in flare rate was reported in those who tapered TNFi to discontinuation. However, most regained remission after reinstatement of full-dose treatment.

Here, we studied disease activity, flares and possible adrenal insufficiency after blinded withdrawal of study medication.
METHODS: Per protocol, patients successfully completing the 2-year trial period linearly tapered and stopped blinded study medication in 3 months. We compared changes in disease activity after taper between treatment groups (one-sided testing). Secondary outcomes (two-sided tests) comprised disease flares (DAS28 (Disease Activity Score 28 joints) increase >0.6, open-label glucocorticoids or disease-modifying antirheumatic drug (DMARD) increase/switch after week 4 of tapering) and symptoms/signs of adrenal insufficiency. In a subset of patients from 3 Dutch centres, cortisol and ACTH were measured in spot serum samples after tapering.
RESULTS: 191 patients were eligible; 36 met treatment-related flare criteria and were only included in the flare analysis. Mean (SD) DAS28 change at follow-up: 0.2 (1.0) in the prednisolone group (n=76) vs 0.0 (1.2) in placebo (n=79). Adjusted for baseline, the between-group difference in DAS28 increase was 0.16 (95% confidence limit -0.06, p=0.12).

METHODS: The study is a post-hoc analysis of patients who completed the Spacing of TNFi injections in Rheumatoid ArthritiS Study (STRASS), a multicentre 18-month equivalence randomised controlled study, of TNFi tapering in RA patients in remission, and had baseline serum samples available for MBDA testing. The primary endpoint of this study was the ability of the baseline MBDA score to predict relapse at any time during the 18 months following initiation of TNFi tapering.

37491906,Lowering Expectations: Glucocorticoid Tapering Among Veterans With Rheumatoid Arthritis Achieving Low Disease Activity on Stable Biologic Therapy.,2023-07-25,"OBJECTIVE: In the Steroid EliMination In Rheumatoid Arthritis (SEMIRA) trial, 65% of patients with rheumatoid arthritis (RA) in low disease activity (LDA) on stable biologic therapy successfully tapered glucocorticoids. We aimed to evaluate real-world rates of glucocorticoid tapering among similar patients in the Veterans Affairs Rheumatoid Arthritis registry.
METHODS: Within a multicenter, prospective RA cohort, we used registry data and linked pharmacy claims from 2003 to 2021 to identify chronic prednisone users achieving LDA after initiating a new biologic or targeted synthetic disease-modifying antirheumatic drug (b/tsDMARD). We defined the index date as first LDA occurring 60 to 180 days after b/tsDMARD initiation. The primary outcome of successful tapering, assessed at day 180 after LDA, required a 30-day averaged prednisone dose both less than or equal to 5mg/day and at least 50% lower than at the index date. The secondary outcome was discontinuation, defined as a prednisone dose of 0 mg/day at days 180 through 210. We used univariate statistics to compare patient characteristics by fulfillment of the primary outcome.
RESULTS: We evaluated 100 b/tsDMARD courses among 95 patients. Fifty-four courses resulted in successful tapering; 33 resulted in discontinuation. Positive rheumatoid factor, higher erythrocyte sedimentation rate, more background DMARDs, shorter time from b/tsDMARD initiation to LDA, and higher glucocorticoid dose 30 days before LDA were associated with greater likelihood of successful tapering.
CONCLUSION: In a real-world RA cohort of chronic glucocorticoid users in LDA, half successfully tapered and a third discontinued prednisone within 6 months of initiating a new b/tsDMARD.

METHODS: In part A of this phase IIa double-blind study, patients were randomised to TAS5315 4 or 2 mg or placebo once daily for 12 weeks; in part B, all patients received TAS5315 for another 24 weeks. The proportion of patients meeting American College of Rheumatology criteria for 20% improvement (ACR20) at week 12 was assessed (primary endpoint).
RESULTS: Ninety-one patients were randomised in part A, and 84 entered part B. At week 12, 78.9% of patients achieved ACR20 in the TAS5315 combined group vs 60.0% with placebo (p=0.053), 33.3% vs 13.3% achieved ACR50 (p=0.072) and 7.0% vs 0.0% achieved ACR70 (p=0.294), respectively. More patients receiving TAS5315 than placebo had low disease activity or remission at week 12. Clinical and biomarker improvements were maintained during part B. Adverse event (AE) incidence in TAS5315 was similar to placebo in part A; common AEs with TAS5315 were nasopharyngitis (10.3%), pruritus (6.9%) and cystitis (5.2%). Over 36 weeks, nine patients experienced bleeding events of whom four and two patients recovered with drug continuation and interruption, respectively. Three patients recovered after TAS5315 discontinuation.
CONCLUSIONS: The primary endpoint was not achieved. TAS5315 appears to have some bleeding risks, but nevertheless demonstrated numerical differences, compared with placebo, in the improvement rates of all measures of RA disease activity. Future analysis of the risk-benefit of TAS5315 should be considered.

37185309,Sustained remission following the discontinuation of tofacitinib in patients with rheumatoid arthritis (XANADU study): an open-label randomised study.,,"OBJECTIVE: To investigate sustained remission following the discontinuation of tofacitinib in patients with rheumatoid arthritis.
METHODS: Patients who had an inadequate response to methotrexate (MTX) with or without biological disease-modifying antirheumatic drugs were randomly divided into two groups at baseline, and tofacitinib treatment in combination with MTX was administered to both groups. Either MTX or tofacitinib was then withdrawn if patients achieved Clinical Disease Activity Index remission at week 52. The primary outcome was the proportion of patients who sustained clinical remission at week 104.
RESULTS: A total of 113 patients participated in this study. Among them, a total of 48 patients achieved remission at week 52. After discontinuation of tofacitinib, only 29.2% (7/24) of patients remained remission, while 50.0% (10/20) of patients, which was numerically higher but not statistically significant, sustained remission after MTX discontinuation. A greater proportion of bio-naïve patients achieved remission at week 52 and sustained low disease activity with tofacitinib discontinuation at week 104. Additionally, the patients who were able to discontinue tofacitinib without flares had lower rheumatoid factor (p=0.04) and lower anti-cyclic citrullinated peptide antibody (p=0.051) before discontinuation of tofacitinib. No severe adverse events were recorded after discontinuation of tofacitinib or MTX. In patients who relapsed after tofacitinib discontinuation, 71.4% achieved remission with resumption of tofacitinib.

36848153,"Continuation, reduction, or withdrawal of tofacitinib in patients with rheumatoid arthritis achieving sustained disease control: a multicenter, open-label, randomized controlled trial.",2023-02-05,"BACKGROUND: Rheumatoid arthritis (RA), a chronic systemic autoimmune disease, is characterized by synovitis and progressive damage to the bone and cartilage of the joints, leading to disability and reduced quality of life. This study was a randomized clinical trial comparing the outcomes between withdrawal and dose reduction of tofacitinib in patients with RA who achieved sustained disease control.
METHODS: The study was designed as a multicenter, open-label, randomized controlled trial. Eligible patients who were taking tofacitinib (5 mg twice daily) and had achieved sustained RA remission or low disease activity (disease activity score in 28 joints [DAS28] ≤3.2) for at least 3 months were enrolled at six centers in Shanghai, China. Patients were randomly assigned (1:1:1) to one of three treatment groups: continuation of tofacitinib (5 mg twice daily); reduction in tofacitinib dose (5 mg daily); and withdrawal of tofacitinib. Efficacy and safety were assessed up to 6 months.
RESULTS: Overall, 122 eligible patients were enrolled, with 41 in the continuation group, 42 in the dose-reduction group, and 39 in the withdrawal group. After 6 months, the percentage of patients with a DAS28-erythrocyte sedimentation rate (ESR) of <3.2 was significantly lower in the withdrawal group than that in the reduction and continuation groups (20.5%, 64.3%, and 95.1%, respectively; P  < 0.0001 for both comparisons). The average flare-free time was 5.8 months for the continuation group, 4.7 months for the dose reduction group, and 2.4 months for the withdrawal group.
CONCLUSION: Withdrawal of tofacitinib in patients with RA with stable disease control resulted in a rapid and significant loss of efficacy, while standard or reduced doses of tofacitinib maintained a favorable state.

The objective of this project was to adapt a set of prioritized recommendations from the 2021 ACR guideline for the treatment of rheumatoid arthritis RA for the context of Saudi Arabia, by the Saudi Society for Rheumatology (SSR).
METHODS: The process followed the GRADE-ADOLOPMENT methodology, and the reporting adhered to the RIGHT-Ad@pt checklist. Working groups included a coordination group and a 19-member panel representing different stakeholder groups. The Evidence to Decision (EtD) tables included evidence on health effects from the source guideline and contextual information from the Saudi setting.
RESULTS: The panel prioritized and adapted five recommendations from the source guideline. The process led to modifying two out of the five prioritized recommendations, all listed here. In naive patients with low disease activity, methotrexate (MTX) is conditionally recommended over sulfasalazine (SSZ) (modified direction); hydroxychloroquine (HCQ) is conditionally recommended over SSZ (unmodified). Initiation of csDMARDs with short-term glucocorticoids is conditionally recommended over csDMARDs alone in naive patients with moderate to high disease activity (modified direction). Switch to subcutaneous MTX is conditionally recommended over addition/switch to alternative DMARD(s) in patients taking oral MTX who are not at target (unmodified). Discontinuation of MTX is conditionally recommended over gradual discontinuation of the bDMARD or tsDMARD for patients taking MTX plus a bDMARD or tsDMARD who wish to discontinue a DMARD (unmodified).

The Evidence to Decision (EtD) tables included evidence on health effects from the source guideline and contextual information from the Saudi setting.
RESULTS: The panel prioritized and adapted five recommendations from the source guideline. The process led to modifying two out of the five prioritized recommendations, all listed here. In naive patients with low disease activity, methotrexate (MTX) is conditionally recommended over sulfasalazine (SSZ) (modified direction); hydroxychloroquine (HCQ) is conditionally recommended over SSZ (unmodified). Initiation of csDMARDs with short-term glucocorticoids is conditionally recommended over csDMARDs alone in naive patients with moderate to high disease activity (modified direction). Switch to subcutaneous MTX is conditionally recommended over addition/switch to alternative DMARD(s) in patients taking oral MTX who are not at target (unmodified). Discontinuation of MTX is conditionally recommended over gradual discontinuation of the bDMARD or tsDMARD for patients taking MTX plus a bDMARD or tsDMARD who wish to discontinue a DMARD (unmodified).
CONCLUSION: Rheumatologists practicing in Saudi Arabia can use the adoloped recommendations generated by this project while adopting the rest of the recommendations from the 2021 ACR guidelines.","Should patients with RA on DMARDs who are in low disease activity gradually taper off DMARDs, abruptly withdraw DMARDs, or continue DMARDS at the same doses?

36121851,Comparing the effectiveness and safety of Abatacept and Tocilizumab in elderly patients with rheumatoid arthritis.,2022-09-19,"BACKGROUND: The number of biological DMARDs (bDMARDs) used in elderly patients with rheumatoid arthritis (RA) has increased in recent years. We aimed to compare the drug retention rates and safety of abatacept (ABT) and tocilizumab (TCZ) in elderly patients with RA.
METHODS: A total 125 elderly patients with RA (>65 years) who began therapy with either ABT (n = 47) or TCZ (n = 78) between 2014 and 2021 at our institute were enrolled. We compared the drug retention rate and clinical response at 24 weeks between elderly patients with RA treated with ABT and those treated with TCZ. Adverse events (AEs) and the reasons for drug discontinuation were assessed.
RESULTS: There was no significant difference in demographic characteristics except for the use of glucocorticoid between the ABT and TCZ groups. There was no significant difference in the drug retention rate between the ABT and TCZ groups. Furthermore, there was no significant difference in the discontinuation rates due to the lack of effectiveness between these two groups. The proportions of the patients archiving low disease activity at 24 weeks did not differ significantly between the two groups. Whereas, the discontinuation rates due to AEs, including interstitial lung disease (ILD), seemed higher in the TCZ group than in the ABT group. In TCZ-treated group, the concomitant use of methotrexate (MTX) significantly increased the incidences of AEs leading to the discontinuation of TCZ. Whereas these was no significant impact of concomitant use of MTX on the incidences of AEs leading to discontinuation in ABT-treated group.
CONCLUSIONS: In elderly patients with RA treated with ABT and TCZ, drug retention rates were equivalent between the two groups.

35710576,Prediction Aided Tapering In rheumatoid arthritis patients treated with biOlogicals (PATIO): protocol for a randomized controlled trial.,2022-06-16,"BACKGROUND: Biological disease-modifying anti-rheumatic drugs (bDMARDs) are effective in the treatment of rheumatoid arthritis (RA) but are expensive and increase the risk of infection. Therefore, in patients with a stable low level of disease activity or remission, tapering bDMARDs should be considered. Although tapering does not seem to affect long-term disease control, (short-lived) flares are frequent during the tapering process. We have previously developed and externally validated a dynamic flare prediction model for use as a decision aid during stepwise tapering of bDMARDs to reduce the risk of a flare during this process.
METHODS: In this investigator-initiated, multicenter, open-label, randomized (1:1) controlled trial, we will assess the effect of incorporating flare risk predictions into a bDMARD tapering strategy. One hundred sixty RA patients treated with a bDMARD with stable low disease activity will be recruited. In the control group, the bDMARD will be tapered according to ""disease activity guided dose optimization"" (DGDO). In the intervention group, the bDMARD will be tapered according to a strategy that combines DGDO with the dynamic flare prediction model, where the next bDMARD tapering step is not taken in case of a high risk of flare. Patients will be randomized 1:1 to the control or intervention group. The primary outcome is the number of flares per patient (DAS28-CRP increase > 1.2, or DAS28-CRP increase > 0.6 with a current DAS28-CRP ≥ 2.9) during the 18-month follow-up period. Secondary outcomes include the number of patients with a major flare (flare duration ≥ 12 weeks), bDMARD dose reduction, adverse events, disease activity (DAS28-CRP) and patient-reported outcomes such as quality of life and functional disability. Health Care Utilization and Work Productivity will also be assessed.
DISCUSSION: This will be the first clinical trial to evaluate the benefit of applying a dynamic flare prediction model as a decision aid during bDMARD tapering. Reducing the risk of flaring during tapering may enhance the safety and (cost)effectiveness of bDMARD treatment. Furthermore, this study pioneers the field of implementing predictive algorithms in clinical practice.

35321739,"Using real-world data to dynamically predict flares during tapering of biological DMARDs in rheumatoid arthritis: development, validation, and potential impact of prediction-aided decisions.",2022-03-23,"BACKGROUND: Biological disease-modifying antirheumatic drugs (bDMARDs) are effective in the treatment of rheumatoid arthritis. However, as bDMARDs may also lead to adverse events and are expensive, tapering them is of great clinical interest. Tapering according to disease activity-guided dose optimization (DGDO) does not seem to affect long term remission rates, but flares are frequent during this process. Our objective was to develop a model for the prediction of flares during bDMARD tapering using data from routine care and to evaluate its potential clinical impact.
METHODS: We used a joint latent class model to repeatedly predict the probability of a flare occurring within the next 3 months. The model was developed using longitudinal data on disease activity (DAS28) and other routine care data from two clinics. Predictive accuracy was assessed in cross-validation and external validation was performed with data from the DRESS (Dose REduction Strategy of Subcutaneous tumor necrosis factor inhibitors) trial. Additionally, we simulated the reduction in number of flares and bDMARD dose when implementing the model as a decision aid during bDMARD tapering in the DRESS trial.
RESULTS: Data from 279 bDMARD courses were used for model development. The final model included two latent DAS28-trajectories, bDMARD type and dose, disease duration, and seropositivity. The area under the curve of the final model was 0.76 (0.69-0.83) in cross-validation and 0.68 (0.62-0.73) in external validation. In simulation of prediction-aided decisions, the mean number of flares over 18 months decreased from 1.21 (0.99-1.43) to 0.75 (0.54-0.96). The reduction in he bDMARD dose was mostly maintained, increasing from 54 to 64% of full dose.
CONCLUSIONS: We developed a dynamic flare prediction model, exclusively based on data typically available in routine care. Our results show that using this model to aid decisions during bDMARD tapering may significantly reduce the number of flares while maintaining most of the bDMARD dose reduction.

FDG-PET/CT might also detect malignancies, but the amount of incidental findings and the number of relevant malignant diseases that could be missed are currently unknown. We aimed to study the malignancy screening performance of whole-body FDG-PET/CT in longstanding RA patients with low disease activity.
METHODS: FDG-PET/CT scanning was done in the intervention arm of the Dose REduction Strategy of Subcutaneous TNF-inhibitors (DRESS) study, a randomized controlled trial on dose-tapering of biological DMARDs. The reference standard was clinical diagnosis of malignancy during the 3-year follow-up period of the study. Prevalence of extra-articular abnormalities, follow-up and treatments were summarized post hoc.
RESULTS: One hundred and twenty-one scans were carried out in 79 patients. Extra-articular abnormalities were found in 59 of 121 (49%) scans, resulting in additional diagnostic procedures in 21 of 79 (26.6%) patients. Nine patients (7.4%) were suspected of malignancy; none turned out to be malignant. Six clinical malignancies that developed during follow-up were all negative on baseline FDG-PET/CT.

METHODS: At period 1, 436 RA patients who were treated with MTX and bDMARDs and had maintained DAS28(ESR) at &lt;2.6 were divided into five groups based on shared patient/physician decision-making; continuation, dose reduction and discontinuation of MTX or bDMARDs. At end of year 1, patients who achieved DAS28(ESR) &lt;3.2 were allowed to enrol in period 2 for treatment using the de-escalation regimens for another year. The primary and secondary endpoints were the proportion of patients with DAS28(ESR) &lt;2.6 at year 1 and 2, respectively.
RESULTS: Based on shared decision-making, 81.4% elected de-escalation of treatment and 48.4% selected de-escalation of MTX.

Patients who completed the 48-week double-blind period could enter an LTE for up to 10 years. Safety and efficacy results were analysed here through 3 years. Treatment-emergent adverse events (AEs) were summarised based on exposure to upadacitinib and adalimumab. Efficacy was analysed by original randomised groups (non-responder imputation), as well as separately by treatment sequence (as observed).
RESULTS: Rates of several AEs were generally comparable between upadacitinib and adalimumab, including AEs leading to discontinuation, serious infections and serious AEs, malignancies, major adverse cardiac events, venous thromboembolism and deaths. Consistent with earlier results, herpes zoster, lymphopaenia, hepatic disorder and CPK elevation were reported at higher rates with upadacitinib versus adalimumab. In terms of efficacy, upadacitinib continued to show numerically better clinical responses than adalimumab over 3 years across all endpoints, including low disease activity and remission.

Previous trials have shown that upadacitinib, a Janus kinase inhibitor, can effectively improve disease activity and prevent progression of joint destruction in RA patients with inadequate responses to methotrexate (MTX). It remains unclear whether reduced disease activity can be maintained after discontinuation of MTX in patients treated with upadacitinib plus MTX. Thus, the aim of this study is to evaluate changes in disease activity after administration of upadacitinib plus MTX in RA patients who failed to achieve an adequate response to MTX and to determine whether clinical relapse can be avoided after discontinuation of MTX in those who achieved clinical remission.
METHODS/DESIGN: The proposed study is an interventional, multicenter, open-label, single-arm clinical trial with a 48-week follow-up. The cohort will include 155 RA patients with at least moderate disease activity during treatment with MTX. Patients will receive upadacitinib and MTX will be discontinued for those who achieve clinical remission. Disease activity will be evaluated longitudinally by measuring clinical disease activity indices and with musculoskeletal ultrasound (MSUS). The primary endpoint is the proportion of patients who sustain a disease activity score-28- C reactive protein score of ≤3.2 from week 24 to 48 after a disease activity score-28- C reactive protein score of <2.6 at week 24. Important secondary endpoints are changes from baseline MSUS scores. Serum levels of multiple biomarkers, including cytokines and chemokines, will be comprehensively analyzed.
DISCUSSION: The study results are expected to show the clinical benefit of the discontinuation of MTX after achieving clinical remission by treatment with upadacitinib plus MTX combination therapy. The strength of this study is the prospective evaluation of therapeutic efficacy using clinical disease activity indices and standardized MSUS, which can accurately and objectively evaluate disease activity at the joint level among patients drawn from multiple centers.

38297524,"Treatment tapering and stopping in patients with rheumatoid arthritis in stable remission (RETRO): a multicentre, randomised, controlled, open-label, phase 3 trial.",2021-10-01,"BACKGROUND: Owing to increasing remission rates, the management of patients with rheumatoid arthritis in sustained remission is of growing interest. The Rheumatoid Arthritis in Ongoing Remission (RETRO) study investigated tapering and withdrawal of disease-modifying antirheumatic drugs (DMARDs) in patients with rheumatoid arthritis in stable remission to test whether remission could be retained without the need to take DMARD therapy despite an absence of symptoms.
METHODS: RETRO was an investigator-initiated, multicentre, prospective, randomised, controlled, open-label, parallel-group phase 3 trial in patients aged at least 18 years with rheumatoid arthritis for at least 12 months before randomisation who were in sustained Disease Activity Score using 28 joints with erythrocyte sedimentation rate (ESR) remission (score <2·6 units). Eligible patients were recruited consecutively from 14 German hospitals or rheumatology practices and randomly assigned (1:1:1) without stratification and regardless of baseline treatment, using a sequence that was computer-generated by the study statistician, to continue 100% dose DMARD (continue group), taper to 50% dose DMARD (taper group), or 50% dose DMARD for 6 months before stopping DMARDs (stop group). Neither patients nor investigators were masked to the treatment assignment. Patients were assessed every 3 months and screened for disease activity and relapse. The primary endpoint was the proportion of patients in sustained DAS28-ESR remission without relapse at 12 months, analysed using a log-rank test of trend and Cox regression. Analysis by a trained statistician of the primary outcome and safety was done in a modified intention-to-treat population that included participants with non-missing baseline data. This study is completed and closed to new participants and is registered with ClinicalTrials.gov (NCT02779114).
FINDINGS: Between May 26, 2010, and May 29, 2018, 303 patients were enrolled and allocated to continue (n=100), taper (n=102), or stop DMARDs (n=101). 282 (93%) of 303 patients were analysed (93 [93%] of 100 for continue, 93 [91%] of 102 for taper, and 96 [95%] of 101 for stop). Remission was maintained at 12 months by 81·2% (95% CI 73·3-90·0) in the continue group, 58·6% (49·2-70·0) in the taper group, and 43·3% (34·6-55·5) in the stop group (p=0·0005 with log-rank test for trend). Hazard ratios for relapse were 3·02 (1·69-5·40; p=0.0003) for the taper group and 4·34 (2·48-7·60; p<0.0001)) for the stop group, in comparison with the continue group. The majority of patients who relapsed regained remission after reintroduction of 100% dose DMARDs. Serious adverse events occurred in ten of 93 (11%) patients in the continue group, seven of 93 (8%) patients in taper group, and 13 of 96 (14%) patients in the stop group. None were considered to be related to the intervention. The most frequent type of serious adverse event was injuries or procedural complications (n=9).
INTERPRETATION: Reducing antirheumatic drugs in patients with rheumatoid arthritis in stable remission is feasible, with maintenance of remission occurring in about half of the patients. Because relapse rates were significantly higher in patients who tapered or stopped antirheumatic drugs than in patients who continued with a 100% dose, such approaches will require tight monitoring of disease activity. However, remission was regained after reintroduction of antirheumatic treatments in most of those who relapsed in this study. These results might help to prevent overtreatment in a substantial number of patients with rheumatoid arthritis.

Tapering has already been investigated, but its feasibility remains to be determined. Therefore, we explored the feasibility of tapering etanercept in RA in a setting close to practice.
METHOD: Patients with RA in 28-joint Disease Activity Score (DAS28) remission (≥ 6 months) and treated with etanercept 50 mg weekly (≥ 1 year) were included in the pragmatic 1 year open-label multicentre randomized controlled TapERA (Tapering Etanercept in Rheumatoid Arthritis) trial.

METHODS: In this cohort, 609 RA patients were divided into three groups: (i) very early treatment (VET): ≤ 3 months; (ii) early treatment (ET): 3-12 months; and (iii) late treatment (LT) > 12 months after the onset of the disease. Four levels of remission were defined: (i) sustained remission on treatment, (ii) sustained glucocorticoids free remission, (iii) sustained disease-modifying anti-rheumatic drugs (DMARDs) free remission, and (iv) long-term remission. Outcome was assessed based on the number of patients in sustained or long-term remission and patients with poor joint outcome and systemic involvement.
RESULTS: There were no significant differences in the remission rate between the groups. Time to sustained remission in VET group was shorter than ET and LT groups. There were no significant differences in the rate and duration of prednisolone discontinuation in the studied groups.

Glucocorticoids (GCs) and DMARDs were discontinued in 66.1% and 48.2% of the patients, respectively. Apart from the older age of the patients in the on-GCs group, no significant differences were observed between the groups.
CONCLUSION: Our study showed that using DMARDs with tight control strategy at the presentation of AOSD may control disease activity successfully. Key Points • Using DMARDs with tight control strategy at the presentation of adult-onset Still's disease may control disease activity successfully.","Should patients with RA on DMARDs who are in low disease activity gradually taper off DMARDs, abruptly withdraw DMARDs, or continue DMARDS at the same doses?

33944875,Effect of Half-Dose vs Stable-Dose Conventional Synthetic Disease-Modifying Antirheumatic Drugs on Disease Flares in Patients With Rheumatoid Arthritis in Remission: The ARCTIC REWIND Randomized Clinical Trial.,,"IMPORTANCE: Sustained remission has become an achievable goal for patients with rheumatoid arthritis (RA) receiving conventional synthetic disease-modifying antirheumatic drugs (csDMARDs), but how to best treat patients in clinical remission remains unclear.
OBJECTIVE: To assess the effect of tapering of csDMARDs, compared with continuing csDMARDs without tapering, on the risk of flares in patients with RA in sustained remission.
DESIGN, SETTING, AND PARTICIPANTS: ARCTIC REWIND was a multicenter, randomized, parallel, open-label noninferiority study conducted in 10 Norwegian hospital-based rheumatology practices. A total of 160 patients with RA in remission for 12 months who were receiving stable csDMARD therapy were enrolled between June 2013 and June 2018, and the final visit occurred in June 2019.
INTERVENTIONS: Patients were randomly assigned to half-dose csDMARDs (n = 80) or stable-dose csDMARDs (n = 80).
MAIN OUTCOMES AND MEASURES: The primary end point was the proportion of patients with a disease flare between baseline and the 12-month follow-up, defined as a combination of Disease Activity Score (DAS) greater than 1.6 (threshold for RA remission), an increase in DAS score of 0.6 units or more, and at least 2 swollen joints. A disease flare could also be recorded if both the patient and investigator agreed that a clinically significant flare had occurred. A risk difference of 20% was defined as the noninferiority margin.
RESULTS: Of 160 enrolled patients (mean [SD] age, 55.1 [11.9] years; 66% female), 156 received the allocated therapy, of which 155 without any major protocol violations were included in the primary analysis population (77 receiving half-dose and 78 receiving stable-dose csDMARDs). Flare occurred in 19 patients (25%) in the half-dose csDMARD group compared with 5 (6%) in the stable-dose csDMARD group (risk difference, 18% [95% CI, 7%-29%]). Adverse events occurred in 34 patients (44%) in the half-dose group and 42 (54%) in the stable-dose group, none leading to study discontinuation. No deaths occurred.
CONCLUSIONS AND RELEVANCE: Among patients with RA in remission taking csDMARD therapy, treatment with half-dose vs stable-dose csDMARDs did not demonstrate noninferiority for the percentage of patients with disease flares over 12 months, and there were significantly fewer flares in the stable-dose group. These findings do not support treatment with half-dose therapy.

METHODS: Patients with rheumatoid arthritis (RA) enrolled in a Japanese multicenter observational registry between 2011 and 2020 were included. EORA was defined as RA with onset at 60 or over. To adjust confounding by indication for treatment with TNFi or IL-6i, a propensity score based on multiple baseline characteristics variables was used to compare the drug retention and causes for discontinuation between TNFi and IL-6i. Adjusted cumulative incidence of drug discontinuation for each reason was compared between the two groups using the Fine-Gray model.
RESULTS: Among a total of 9,550 patients in the registry, 674 TNFi and 297 IL-6i initiators with EORA were identified. Age, the proportion of females, disease duration, and baseline disease activity at the time of TNFi or IL-6i initiation were similar between the two groups. After adjusting for differences in baseline characteristics between the two groups, overall drug discontinuation was significantly lower in the IL-6i as compared to the TNFi (HR = 0.71, 95%CI = 0.59-0.86, p < 0.001). The adjusted cumulative incidence of discontinuation due to lack of effectiveness was lower with the IL-6i (HR = 0.46, 95%CI = 0.33-0.63, p < 0.001) while those due to adverse events (HR = 0.82, 95%CI = 0.56-1.18, p = 0.28) or achievement of clinical remission (HR = 1.09, 95%CI = 0.62-1.91, p = 0.76) were similar between the two groups.
CONCLUSIONS: In EORA patients initiating a TNFi or IL-6i, significantly higher drug retention was observed with IL-6i.

Criteria for selecting patients that are likely to remain in remission are still incompletely defined. We aimed to identify predictors of successful discontinuation of bDMARD therapy in the Swiss Clinical Quality Management (SCQM) registry, a real-world cohort of RA patients.
METHODS: RA patients in DAS28-ESR remission who stopped bDMARD/tsDMARD treatment were included. Loss of remission was defined as a DAS28-ESR > 2.6 or restart of a bDMARD/tsDMARD. Time to loss of remission was the main outcome. Kaplan-Meier methods were applied and Cox regression was used for multivariable analyses adjusting for confounding factors. Missing data were imputed using multiple imputation.
RESULTS: A total of 318 patients in a bDMARD/tsDMARD-free remission were followed between 1997 and 2017.

Because of high cost, the discontinuation is common but often lead to disease relapse. The study aims to investigate, if the combination therapy of csDMARDs is more effective in reducing disease relapse than methotrexate (MTX) monotherapy, and more cost-effective than continuing TNFi and MTX.
METHODS: It will be a two-stage trial. In the first stage, all RA patients who failed to csDMARDs treatment [disease activity score 28 (DAS28)-CRP > 3.2] will receive MTX plus TNFi for no more than 12 weeks. Patients achieving DAS28-CRP < 3.2 during the first stage will be randomized into three groups at 1:1:1 ratio: (A) add hydroxychloroquine (HCQ) and sulfasalazine (SSZ) for the first 12 weeks and then remove TNFi but continue other treatments for the next 48 weeks; (B) maintain TNFi + MTX for 60 weeks; and (C) maintain TNFi + MTX for the first 12 weeks and then remove TNFi but continue MTX monotherapy for the next 48 weeks. The primary outcome will be disease relapse (DAS28-CRP increases by at least 0.6 and > 3.2). Secondary outcomes will include the incremental cost per reducing 1 case of relapse; patient reported intolerance to the treatment; adverse events; change of mean disease activity measured by DAS28, clinical disease activity index (CDAI) and simplified disease activity index (SDAI); the proportion of modified Sharp score increase < 0.3; ultrasound-detected remission in hands; Health Assessment Questionnaire Disability Index (HAQ-DI) and health related quality of life [the five-level EuroQol-5D (EQ-5D-5L) and short form-6D (SF-6D)].

This study was undertaken to investigate whether sustained remission achieved on combination therapy can be maintained with either methotrexate or etanercept monotherapy, as assessed following discontinuation of one or the other medication from the combination.
METHODS: Of the 371 adult patients with RA who received combination therapy with methotrexate plus etanercept, remission (defined as a Simplified Disease Activity Index [SDAI] score of ≤3.3) was sustained in 253 patients through a 24-week open-label period. These 253 patients then entered a 48-week, double-blind period and were randomized to receive either 1) methotrexate monotherapy (n = 101), 2) etanercept monotherapy (n = 101), or 3) methotrexate plus etanercept combination therapy (n = 51). Patients who subsequently experienced disease-worsening received rescue therapy with the combination regimen at the same dosages as used in the initial run-in period. The primary end point was the proportion of patients in whom SDAI-defined remission was maintained without disease-worsening at week 48 in the etanercept monotherapy group as compared to the methotrexate monotherapy group. Secondary end points included time to disease-worsening, and the proportion of patients in whom SDAI-defined remission was recaptured after initiation of rescue therapy.
RESULTS: Baseline demographic and clinical characteristics of the RA patients were similar across the treatment groups. At week 48, SDAI-defined remission was maintained in significantly more patients in the etanercept monotherapy group than in the methotrexate monotherapy group (49.5% versus 28.7%; P = 0.004). Moreover, as a secondary end point, sustained SDAI-defined remission was achieved in significantly more patients who received combination therapy than in those who received methotrexate monotherapy (52.9% versus 28.7%; P = 0.006). Time to disease-worsening was shorter in those who received methotrexate monotherapy than in those who received etanercept monotherapy or those who received combination therapy (each P < 0.001 versus methotrexate monotherapy). Among the patients who received rescue therapy, SDAI-defined remission was recaptured in 70-80% in each treatment group. No new safety signals were reported.

Methods Among 249 patients receiving IFX from 2007 to 2015, we retrospectively investigated the clinical courses of 18 who discontinued IFX after achieving the 28-joint disease activity score based on the erythrocyte sedimentation (DAS28-ESR) clinical remission (CR) and whose clinical courses were available continuously for 96 weeks after discontinuation. Results At IFX introduction, the median age was 56.9 (range 36.1-72.4) years, and the disease duration was 5.2 (0.4-25.6) years. The median duration of maintaining either CR or a low disease activity (LDA) with IFX was 37.2 (4.0-91.4) months, and the total duration of IFX therapy was 45.8 (17.1-96.9) months.

We are conducting the IFX-SIRIUS STUDY I that evaluates whether switching from originator infliximab (IFX) to its biosimilar, CT-P13, is not inferior in maintaining nonclinical relapse to continue treatment with originator IFX in patients with RA achieving clinical remission. It is the next great issue whether disease activity can be maintained in good condition after discontinuation of CT-P13 because no evidence is available regarding the clinical value of discontinuing biosimilars in patients with RA. Thus, we will evaluate whether a condition without clinical relapse will be maintained after discontinuation of CT-P13 in patients with RA, achieving clinical remission or low disease activity during the IFX-SIRIUS STUDY I.
METHODS/DESIGN: This study is an interventional, multicenter, open-label, single-arm clinical trial with a 48-week follow-up. Patients with RA who are treated with CT-P13 and sustained nonclinical relapse during the IFX-SIRIUS STUDY I will be included. Patients will discontinue CT-P13 after the study period of the IFX-SIRIUS STUDY I. We will evaluate disease activity by clinical disease activity indices and musculoskeletal ultrasound (MSUS). The primary endpoint is the proportion of patients who do not have clinical relapse during the study period. Important secondary endpoints are the changes from the baseline of the MSUS scores. We will also comprehensively analyze the serum levels of multiple biomarkers, such as cytokines and chemokines. In addition, if a clinical relapse occurs in patients after the discontinuation of CT-P13, we will evaluate the effectiveness and safety of restarting CT-P13.
DISCUSSION: The study results are expected to show the clinical benefit of the discontinuation of CT-P13 and effectiveness and safety of restarting CT-P13 after clinical relapse. The strength of this study is to prospectively evaluate the therapeutic effectiveness by not only clinical disease activity indices but also standardized MSUS findings in multiple centers.

Clinical forms of RA were presented: RA, seropositive for rheumatoid factor, RA, seronegative for rheumatoid factor, RA with extra-articular manifestations, adult-oneset Stills disease, juvenile RA. The reasons for the cancellation of bDMARD during the first year of treatment were: insufficient effectiveness (including primary inefficiency), adverse events, administrative reasons, clinical and laboratory remission, death.
RESULTS: A year after being included in the study, treatment was continued in 92 (45%) patients and was discontinued in 112 patients. The average time of treatment amounted to 0.750.33 years.

METHODS: Participants of this multicenter, open-label, uncontrolled, prospective study were RA patients maintaining low disease activity (Clinical Disease Activity Index [CDAI]≤10) for≥12weeks with tocilizumab plus methotrexate. Methotrexate was discontinued after 12weeks of biweekly administration while continuing tocilizumab therapy. Disease flare was defined as either a CDAI score>10 or intervention with rescue treatments for any reason even if the CDAI score was≤10. The impact of baseline characteristics on disease flare at week 64 (52weeks after methotrexate discontinuation) was assessed with logistic regression models.
RESULTS: Efficacy analyses were performed in 49 patients, of whom 15 had a disease flare by week 64. The proportion (95% confidence interval [CI]) of patients who maintained low disease activity without a flare at week 64 was 69.4% (54.6-81.8%). The dosing interval of tocilizumab was longer than that described on the drug label in Japan (i.e., intravenously every 4weeks, or subcutaneously every 2weeks) in 27% and 6% of patients with and without a flare, respectively. Multivariate analysis revealed that male sex (odds ratio [OR]: 18.00, 95% CI: 2.80-115.56) and extended dosing interval of tocilizumab (OR: 12.00, 95% CI: 1.72-83.80) were independent predictors of disease flare.
CONCLUSION: Male patients and those receiving tocilizumab at an extended dosing interval are at high risk of disease flare after discontinuation of concomitant methotrexate.

32494334,Outcomes with Biological Disease-Modifying Anti-Rheumatic Drugs (bDMARDs) in Older Patients Treated for Rheumatoid Arthritis.,2020-05-01,"BACKGROUND: Biological disease-modifying antirheumatic drugs (bDMARDs) are recommended for rheumatoid arthritis (RA), but older patients reportedly experience more adverse events (AEs) and show variable treatment response. The objective of this study was to evaluate AEs and effectiveness of bDMARDs in a cohort of older patients.
METHODS: AE and treatment effectiveness (based on DAS28 scores) data from a prospective provincial pharmacovigilance program for the years 2006-2009 in patients 55-64, 65-74, and 75+ years of age were compared. An intention to treat analysis with chi-square and unpaired -testing for significance was performed.
RESULTS: There were a total of 333 patients (156 were aged 55-64, 125 were 65-74, 52 were 75+). Those 75+ had higher disease activity and worse functional status at baseline. Among those 75+, AEs with bDMARDs were more common and likely to lead to discontinuation of therapy, be graded as severe, and classified as infectious ( < .05).

Abstract: BACKGROUND: Biological disease-modifying antirheumatic drugs (bDMARDs) are recommended for rheumatoid arthritis (RA), but older patients reportedly experience more adverse events (AEs) and show variable treatment response. The objective of this study was to evaluate AEs and effectiveness of bDMARDs in a cohort of older patients.
METHODS: AE and treatment effectiveness (based on DAS28 scores) data from a prospective provincial pharmacovigilance program for the years 2006-2009 in patients 55-64, 65-74, and 75+ years of age were compared. An intention to treat analysis with chi-square and unpaired -testing for significance was performed.
RESULTS: There were a total of 333 patients (156 were aged 55-64, 125 were 65-74, 52 were 75+). Those 75+ had higher disease activity and worse functional status at baseline. Among those 75+, AEs with bDMARDs were more common and likely to lead to discontinuation of therapy, be graded as severe, and classified as infectious ( < .05). Remission rate among those 75+ was significantly higher than patients 65-74. Etanercept was the most commonly used drug in all age groups.
CONCLUSION: Patients 75+ treated with bDMARDs are at a significantly greater risk of AEs, including infectious ones. The higher remission found in the oldest age group warrants further study.","Should patients with RA on DMARDs who are in low disease activity gradually taper off DMARDs, abruptly withdraw DMARDs, or continue DMARDS at the same doses?

32482645,Tapering towards DMARD-free remission in established rheumatoid arthritis: 2-year results of the TARA trial.,2020-06-01,"OBJECTIVES: To evaluate the 2-year clinical effectiveness of two gradual tapering strategies. The first strategy consisted of tapering the conventional synthetic disease-modifying antirheumatic drugs (csDMARDs) first (i.e., methotrexate in ~90%), followed by the tumour necrosis factor inhibitor (TNF-inhibitor), the second strategy consisted of tapering the TNF-inhibitor first, followed by the csDMARD.
METHODS: This multicentre single-blinded randomised controlled trial included patients with rheumatoid arthritis (RA) with well-controlled disease for ≥3 consecutive months, defined as a Disease Activity Score (DAS) measured in 44 joints ≤2.4 and a swollen joint count ≤1, which was achieved with a csDMARD and a TNF-inhibitor. Eligible patients were randomised into gradual tapering the csDMARD followed by the TNF-inhibitor, or vice versa. The primary outcome was the number of disease flares. Secondary outcomes were DMARD-free remission (DFR), DAS, functional ability (Health Assessment Questionnaire Disability Index (HAQ-DI)) and radiographic progression.
RESULTS: 189 patients were randomly assigned to tapering their csDMARD (n=94) or TNF-inhibitor (n=95) first. The cumulative flare rate after 24 months was, respectively, 61% (95% CI 50% to 71%) and 62% (95% CI 52% to 72%). The patients who tapered their csDMARD first were more often able to go through the entire tapering protocol and reached DFR more often than the group that tapered the TNF-inhibitor first (32% vs 20% (p=0.12) and 21% vs 10% (p=0.07), respectively). Mean DAS and HAQ-DI over time, and radiographic progression did not differ between groups (p=0.45, p=0.17, p=0.8, respectively).
CONCLUSION: The order of tapering did not affect flare rates, DAS or HAQ-DI. DFR was achievable in 15% of patients with established RA, slightly more frequent in patients that first tapered csDMARDs.

METHODS: The PREDICTRA phase IV, randomised, double-blind (DB) study (Imact of esidual Inflammation Detected via Imaging Tchniques, rug Levels, and Patient Characteristics on the Outcome of Dose Taperng of Adalimumab in linical Remission Rheumatoid Arhritis () Patients) enrolled patients with RA receiving adalimumab 40 mg every other week who were in sustained remission ≥6 months. After a 4-week, open-label lead-in (OL-LI) period, patients were randomised 5:1 to DB adalimumab taper (every 3 weeks) or withdrawal (placebo) for 36 weeks. The primary endpoint was the association between DB baseline hand and wrist MRI-detected inflammation with flare occurrence.
RESULTS: Of 146 patients treated during the OL-LI period, 122 were randomised to taper (n=102) or withdrawal (n=20) arms. Patients had a mean 12.9 years of active disease and had received adalimumab for a mean of 5.4 years (mean 2.2 years in sustained remission). Overall, 37 (36%) and 9 (45%) patients experienced a flare in the taper and withdrawal arms, respectively (time to flare, 18.0 and 13.3 weeks). None of the DB baseline disease characteristics or adalimumab concentration was associated with flare occurrence after adalimumab tapering. Approximately half of the patients who flared regained clinical remission after 16 weeks of open-label rescue adalimumab. The safety profile was consistent with previous studies.
CONCLUSIONS: Approximately one-third of patients who tapered adalimumab versus half who withdrew adalimumab experienced a flare within 36 weeks. Time to flare was numerically longer in the taper versus withdrawal arm. Baseline MRI inflammation was not associated with flare occurrence.

32345367,Tapering of biological antirheumatic drugs in rheumatoid arthritis patients is achievable and cost-effective in daily clinical practice: data from the Brussels UCLouvain RA Cohort.,2020-04-28,"BACKGROUND/PURPOSE: Studies have demonstrated that rheumatoid arthritis (RA) patients who achieve low disease activity or remission are able to taper biological disease-modifying antirheumatic drugs (bDMARDs). The aim of this study was to evaluate the proportion of patients in whom bDMARDs can be tapered in daily practice and to analyse the characteristics of these patients. Other objectives were to analyse which bDMARDs are more suitable for dose reduction and the cost savings.
RESULTS: Data from 332 eligible RA patients from our Brussels UCLouvain cohort were retrospectively analysed; 140 patients (42.1%) received a tapered regimen, and 192 received stable doses of bDMARDs. The age at diagnosis (43.1 vs 38.7 years, p = 0.04), health assessment questionnaire (HAQ) score (1.3 vs 1.5, p = 0.048), RF positivity rate (83.3 vs 72.9%, p = 0.04) and disease duration at the time of bDMARD introduction (9.7 vs 12.1 years, p = 0.034) were significantly different between the reduced-dose and stable-dose groups. Interestingly, relatively more patients receiving a tapered dose were treated with a combination of bDMARDs and methotrexate (MTX) (86.7% vs 73.8%, p = 0.005). In our cohort, anti-TNF agents were the most commonly prescribed medications (68%). Only 15 patients experienced a flare during follow-up. Adalimumab, etanercept and rituximab were the most common bDMARDs in the reduced-dose group and were associated with the most important reductions in annual cost.
CONCLUSION: In daily practice, tapering bDMARDs in RA patients who have achieved low disease activity or remission is an achievable goal in a large proportion of patients, thereby reducing potential side effects and annual drug-associated costs. The combination of bDMARDs with MTX could improve the success of dose reduction attempts.

31957303,Factors associated with successful discontinuation of certolizumab pegol in early rheumatoid arthritis.,2020-01-19,"AIM: The Certolizumab-Optimal Prevention of joint damage for Early Rheumatoid Arthritis (C-OPERA) study demonstrated that in methotrexate (MTX)-naïve early RA patients with poor prognostic factors, 1-year certolizumab pegol (CZP) therapy added to the first year of 2-year optimized MTX therapy brings radiographic and clinical benefits through 2 years even after stopping CZP. This exploratory analysis aimed to identify factors at baseline and at CZP discontinuation associated with successful CZP discontinuation.
METHODS: MTX-naïve early RA patients with poor prognostic factors entered C-OPERA (NCT01451203), a multicenter, randomized controlled trial. Patients were randomized to CZP + MTX (n = 159) or PBO + MTX (n = 157); those who completed the 1-year, double-blind period received MTX alone in Year 2 (CZP + MTX→MTX, n = 108; PBO + MTX→MTX, n = 71). Association between factors at baseline or at discontinuation of CZP and clinical/radiographic outcomes were evaluated by multiple logistic regression analysis. Predictive value cut-offs were calculated using receiver operating characteristic analysis.
RESULTS: Sex (male) and low baseline Disease Activity Score of 28 joints - erythrocyte sedimentation rate (DAS28-ESR) were associated with simple disease activity index (SDAI) remission (≤3.3), whereas high baseline DAS28-ESR and modified total Sharp score (mTSS) were associated with clinically relevant radiographic progression (yearly progression mTSS > 3) at Week 104 (across both treatment arms). Low DAS28-ESR (<2.1) and rheumatoid factor (RF; <74 IU/mL) at discontinuation of CZP were associated with SDAI remission at Week 104.

Abstract: AIM: The Certolizumab-Optimal Prevention of joint damage for Early Rheumatoid Arthritis (C-OPERA) study demonstrated that in methotrexate (MTX)-naïve early RA patients with poor prognostic factors, 1-year certolizumab pegol (CZP) therapy added to the first year of 2-year optimized MTX therapy brings radiographic and clinical benefits through 2 years even after stopping CZP. This exploratory analysis aimed to identify factors at baseline and at CZP discontinuation associated with successful CZP discontinuation.
METHODS: MTX-naïve early RA patients with poor prognostic factors entered C-OPERA (NCT01451203), a multicenter, randomized controlled trial. Patients were randomized to CZP + MTX (n = 159) or PBO + MTX (n = 157); those who completed the 1-year, double-blind period received MTX alone in Year 2 (CZP + MTX→MTX, n = 108; PBO + MTX→MTX, n = 71). Association between factors at baseline or at discontinuation of CZP and clinical/radiographic outcomes were evaluated by multiple logistic regression analysis. Predictive value cut-offs were calculated using receiver operating characteristic analysis.
RESULTS: Sex (male) and low baseline Disease Activity Score of 28 joints - erythrocyte sedimentation rate (DAS28-ESR) were associated with simple disease activity index (SDAI) remission (≤3.3), whereas high baseline DAS28-ESR and modified total Sharp score (mTSS) were associated with clinically relevant radiographic progression (yearly progression mTSS > 3) at Week 104 (across both treatment arms). Low DAS28-ESR (<2.1) and rheumatoid factor (RF; <74 IU/mL) at discontinuation of CZP were associated with SDAI remission at Week 104. At Week 104, SDAI remission was achieved by 75.0% (42/56) of patients with low DAS28-ESR and RF at discontinuation, compared to 15.4% (2/13) of patients with high DAS28-ESR and RF.
CONCLUSION: Patients with low RF and low disease activity after treatment with CZP + MTX may be able to discontinue CZP without risk of loss of response.","Should patients with RA on DMARDs who are in low disease activity gradually taper off DMARDs, abruptly withdraw DMARDs, or continue DMARDS at the same doses?

31802391,Tapering Biologic Therapy for Rheumatoid Arthritis: A Qualitative Study of Patient Perspectives.,,"BACKGROUND AND OBJECTIVE: Biologic therapies are cost effective for active rheumatoid arthritis but have adverse effects and are costly. Tapering of biologics is emerging as an important consideration when sustained remission is achieved. Recent trials have highlighted the clinical feasibility of tapering, but there is little evidence on how proposed tapering would be received by patients. The aim of this study was to explore factors influencing hypothetical decisions of patients with rheumatoid arthritis on tapering their biologics and their perspectives on remission and flare when considering the possibility of tapering.
METHODS: Patients with rheumatoid arthritis with diverse experiences of biologics with different modes of administration were purposively sampled to participate in one of six focus groups (n = 43) or an individual interview (n = 2). Transcripts were analyzed using inductive thematic analysis.
RESULTS: Five overarching themes on what influences a participant's decision to taper their biologic were identified. First, participants were fearful of uncertain outcomes of tapering, especially flare and joint damage. Second, participants prioritized quality of life from continuing biologics over the risk of adverse effects. Third, tapering biologics was seen as providing relief from the inconvenience of taking biologics regularly. Fourth, participants wanted assurance of prompt access to healthcare if their rheumatoid arthritis were to flare when tapering. Fifth, preferences for involvement in decision making varied, but fulfilling information needs was desired to aid a patient's preferred role in decision making on tapering.

METHODS: In total, 1,629 RA patients with an inadequate response to MTX were randomized (2:2:1) to receive upadacitinib (15 mg once daily), placebo, or adalimumab (40 mg every other week) while continuing to take a stable background dose of MTX. The primary end points were achievement of an American College of Rheumatology 20% (ACR20) improvement response and a Disease Activity Score in 28 joints using C-reactive protein level (DAS28-CRP) of <2.6 in the upadacitinib group compared to the placebo group at week 12; inhibition of radiographic progression was evaluated at week 26. The study was also designed and powered to test for the noninferiority and superiority of upadacitinib compared to adalimumab, as measured both clinically and functionally.
RESULTS: At week 12, both primary end points were met in patients receiving upadacitinib compared to those receiving placebo (P ≤ 0.001). An ACR20 improvement response was achieved by 71% of patients in the upadacitinib group compared to 36% in the placebo group, and a DAS28-CRP score of <2.6 was observed in 29% of patients receiving upadacitinib compared to 6% of patients receiving placebo. Upadacitinib was superior to adalimumab based on the ACR50 response rate, achievement of a DAS28-CRP score of ≤3.2, change in pain severity score, and change in the Health Assessment Questionnaire disability index. At week 26, more patients receiving upadacitinib than those receiving placebo or adalimumab achieved low disease activity or remission (P ≤ 0.001). Radiographic progression was significantly inhibited in patients receiving upadacitinib and was observed in fewer upadacitinib-treated patients than placebo-treated patients (P ≤ 0.001). Up to week 26, adverse events (AEs), including serious infections, were comparable between the upadacitinib and adalimumab groups. The proportions of patients with serious AEs and AEs leading to discontinuation were highest in the adalimumab group; the proportions of patients with herpes zoster and those with creatine phosphokinase (CPK) elevations were highest in the upadacitinib group. Three malignancies, 5 major adverse cardiovascular events, and 4 deaths were reported among the groups, but none occurred in patients receiving upadacitinib. Six venous thromboembolic events were reported (1 in the placebo group, 2 in the upadacitinib group, and 3 in the adalimumab group).
CONCLUSION: Upadacitinib was superior to placebo and adalimumab for improving signs, symptoms, and physical function in RA patients who were receiving background MTX. In addition, radiographic progression was significantly inhibited by upadacitinib as compared to placebo. The overall safety profile of upadacitinib was generally similar to that of adalimumab, except for higher rates of herpes zoster and CPK elevations in patients receiving upadacitinib.",10.1002/art.41032,"['Clinical Trial, Phase III', 'Journal Article', 'Randomized Controlled Trial', ""Research Support, Non-U.S. Gov't""]","Title: Upadacitinib Versus Placebo or Adalimumab in Patients With Rheumatoid Arthritis and an Inadequate Response to Methotrexate: Results of a Phase III, Double-Blind, Randomized Controlled Trial.

Up to week 26, adverse events (AEs), including serious infections, were comparable between the upadacitinib and adalimumab groups. The proportions of patients with serious AEs and AEs leading to discontinuation were highest in the adalimumab group; the proportions of patients with herpes zoster and those with creatine phosphokinase (CPK) elevations were highest in the upadacitinib group. Three malignancies, 5 major adverse cardiovascular events, and 4 deaths were reported among the groups, but none occurred in patients receiving upadacitinib. Six venous thromboembolic events were reported (1 in the placebo group, 2 in the upadacitinib group, and 3 in the adalimumab group).
CONCLUSION: Upadacitinib was superior to placebo and adalimumab for improving signs, symptoms, and physical function in RA patients who were receiving background MTX. In addition, radiographic progression was significantly inhibited by upadacitinib as compared to placebo. The overall safety profile of upadacitinib was generally similar to that of adalimumab, except for higher rates of herpes zoster and CPK elevations in patients receiving upadacitinib.","Should patients with RA on DMARDs who are in low disease activity gradually taper off DMARDs, abruptly withdraw DMARDs, or continue DMARDS at the same doses?

31277720,The effect of deep or sustained remission on maintenance of remission after dose reduction or withdrawal of etanercept in patients with rheumatoid arthritis.,2019-07-05,"BACKGROUND: Biologic disease-modifying antirheumatic drugs (bDMARDs) are important options for managing rheumatoid arthritis (RA). Once patients achieve disease control, clinicians may consider dose reduction or withdrawal of the bDMARD. Results from published studies indicate that some patients will maintain remission; however, others will flare. We analyzed data from three etanercept down-titration studies in patients with RA to determine what extent of remission provides the greatest predictability of maintaining remission following dose reduction or discontinuation.
METHODS: Patients with moderate to severe RA from the PRESERVE, PRIZE, and Treat-to-Target (T2T) randomized controlled trials were included. We determined the proportion of patients achieving remission with etanercept at the last time point in the induction period, and sustained remission (last two time points), according to the Disease Activity Score 28-joints (DAS28), the American College of Rheumatology (ACR)/European League Against Rheumatism (EULAR) Boolean criteria, and the clinical disease activity index (CDAI). We also calculated the proportion achieving DAS28 deep remission (DAS28 ≤ 1.98), sustained deep remission (last two time points), and low disease activity (LDA), and LDA according to the CDAI. Then, we evaluated whether they maintained remission or LDA following etanercept dose reduction or withdrawal.
RESULTS: Patients achieving sustained and/or deep remission were more likely than patients achieving remission or LDA to maintain remission/LDA after etanercept dose reduction or withdrawal. In PRESERVE, the proportions of patients with DAS28 sustained deep remission, deep remission, sustained remission, remission, and LDA who maintained remission following etanercept dose reduction were 81%, 67%, 58%, 56%, and 36%, respectively, P < 0.001 for trend. In PRESERVE, this trend was significant when etanercept was discontinued and when ACR/EULAR Boolean and CDAI remission criteria were used. Although some sample sizes were small, the PRIZE and T2T studies also demonstrated response trends according to ACR/EULAR Boolean and CDAI remission criteria, and T2T demonstrated response trends according to DAS28.
CONCLUSIONS: These results suggest that patients achieving disease control according to a stringent definition, such as sustained ACR/EULAR Boolean or CDAI remission, or a new definition of sustained deep remission by DAS28, have a higher probability of remaining in remission or LDA following etanercept dose reduction or withdrawal.

31257453,"Impact of flare on radiographic progression after etanercept continuation, tapering or withdrawal in patients with rheumatoid arthritis.",,"OBJECTIVES: The structural consequences of flare after dose reduction/discontinuation of biologic DMARDs in patients with RA who achieve remission are unclear. We compared the incidence of radiographic progression in patients with RA who did and did not experience flare after etanercept (ETN) reduction/withdrawal.
METHODS: Eligible adults with moderately active RA despite MTX received ETN 50 mg plus MTX weekly in a 36-week, open-label induction period; patients achieving sustained low disease activity by week 36 were randomized to ETN 50 mg plus MTX, ETN 25 mg plus MTX, or placebo plus MTX in a 52-week, double-blind maintenance period. In post hoc analyses, radiographic progression (Δ modified total Sharp score ⩾0.5 units/year) was compared in patients with and without flare [based on DAS28 relapse (main analysis), and clinical disease activity index and simplified disease activity index relapse (sensitivity analyses)]. Findings from patients receiving full- and reduced-dose combination therapy were pooled for comparison with those from patients receiving MTX only.
RESULTS: Significantly more patients receiving MTX monotherapy experienced flare, defined as DAS28 relapse (62% vs 21%; P < 0.0001) and radiographic progression (17% vs 9%; P < 0.001), than patients receiving full-/reduced-dose combination therapy in the double-blind period. Patients with flare defined as clinical disease activity index and simplified disease activity index relapse had higher rates of radiographic progression than those without flare in the full-/reduced-dose combination therapy group (P < 0.01).

Clinically relevant risk factors and significant prognostic factors for retention were evaluated using a Cox proportional hazards multivariable model.
RESULTS: Overall, 2350/2364 enrolled patients were evaluable; 673 (28.6%) were biologic naive and 1677 (71.4%) had prior biologic failure (1 biologic, 728/1677 [43.4%]; ≥ 2 biologics, 949/1677 [56.6%]). Abatacept retention rate (95% confidence interval [CI]) at 2 years was 47.9% (45.7, 50.0): 54.5% (50.4, 58.3) for biologic-naive vs 45.2% (42.7, 47.7) for biologic-failure patients (log-rank P < 0.001). For patients with 1 and ≥ 2 prior biologic failures, respectively, retention rates (95% CI) were 50.2% (46.3, 53.9) vs 41.3% (38.0, 44.6; log-rank P < 0.001). Main reasons for discontinuation (biologic-naive vs biologic-failure, respectively) were lack of efficacy (61.4 vs 67.7%) and safety (21.3 vs 21.2%).

DAS28-4(ESR) scores and changes from baseline, and rates and reasons for discontinuation, were evaluated for all groups over 24 months.
RESULTS: The 2778 treatment courses in this analysis included 714 MTX monotherapy, 396 bDMARD monotherapy, 1460 bDMARDs + MTX and 208 bDMARDs + other csDMARDs. Of patients with DAS28-4(ESR) data at Months 6 and 12 (25.0-34.1%), 33.9-47.2% did not switch treatment and were inadequate-responders at Month 12. There were no significant differences in efficacy between bDMARD groups (bDMARD monotherapy, or bDMARDs + MTX or other csDMARDs). Lack of efficacy was the most common reason for stopping treatment across all groups (13.7-22.1% over 24 months).
CONCLUSION: An unmet treatment need exists for patients still experiencing inadequate response to MTX monotherapy and bDMARDs as monotherapy or in combination with MTX/other csDMARDs after 12 months.

METHODS: Patients with RA with TCZ from eight European registries were included. Drug retention was compared using unadjusted Kaplan-Meier and Cox models adjusted for baseline patient, disease and treatment characteristics, using a strata term for year of treatment initiation and country of registry. The proportions of patients achieving Clinical Disease Activity Index (CDAI) remission and low disease activity (LDA) at 1 year were compared using samples matched on the same covariates and corrected for attrition using LUNDEX.
RESULTS: 3448 patients were retrieved, 2414 with TCZ-IV and 1034 with TCZ-SC. Crude median retention was 3.52 years (95% CI 3.22 to 3.85) for TCZ-IV and 2.12 years for TCZ-SC (95% CI 1.88 to 2.38). In a country-stratified and year of treatment initiation-stratified, covariate-adjusted analysis, hazards of discontinuation were similar between TCZ-SC and TCZ-IV treated patients (HR 0.93, 95% CI 0.80 to 1.09). The average adjusted CDAI change at 1 year was similar in both groups (-6.08).

30194275,Dose reduction of baricitinib in patients with rheumatoid arthritis achieving sustained disease control: results of a prospective study.,2018-09-07,"OBJECTIVES: This study investigated the effects of dose step-down in patients with rheumatoid arthritis (RA) who achieved sustained disease control with baricitinib 4 mg once a day.
METHODS: Patients who completed a baricitinib phase 3 study could enter a long-term extension (LTE). In the LTE, patients who received baricitinib 4 mg for ≥15 months and maintained CDAI low disease activity (LDA) or remission (REM) were blindly randomised to continue 4 mg or taper to 2 mg. Patients could rescue (to 4 mg) if needed. Efficacy and safety were assessed through 48 weeks.
RESULTS: Patients in both groups maintained LDA (80% 4 mg; 67% 2 mg) or REM (40% 4 mg; 33% 2 mg) over 48 weeks. However, dose reduction resulted in small, statistically significant increases in disease activity at 12, 24 and 48 weeks. Dose reduction also produced earlier and more frequent relapse (loss of step-down criteria) over 48 weeks compared with 4 mg maintenance (23% 4 mg vs 37% 2 mg, p=0.001). Rescue rates were 10% for baricitinib 4 mg and 18% for baricitinib 2 mg. Dose reduction was associated with a numerically lower rate of non-serious infections (30.6 for baricitinib 4 mg vs 24.9 for 2 mg). Rates of serious adverse events and adverse events leading to discontinuation were similar across groups.
CONCLUSIONS: In a large randomised, blinded phase 3 study, maintenance of RA control following induction of sustained LDA/REM with baricitinib 4 mg was greater with continued 4 mg than after taper to 2 mg. Nonetheless, most patients tapered to 2 mg could maintain LDA/REM or recapture with return to 4 mg if needed.",10.1136/annrheumdis-2018-213271,"['Clinical Trial, Phase III', 'Journal Article', 'Randomized Controlled Trial', ""Research Support, Non-U.S. Gov't""]","Title: Dose reduction of baricitinib in patients with rheumatoid arthritis achieving sustained disease control: results of a prospective study.

METHODS: The SURPRISE study was a 2-year, open-label randomised controlled study. Among patients who had been randomised to additional tocilizumab (ADD-ON) or switch to tocilizumab (SWITCH) in the first year, those who achieved remission based on the disease activity score for 28 joints (DAS28-ESR<2.6) discontinued tocilizumab at week 52 and were observed for the following 52 weeks. The endpoint of the second year included tocilizumab-free remission and low disease-activity rates, functional outcome, radiological outcomes assessed with the modified total Sharp score (mTSS) and safety. The efficacy of reinstituted tocilizumab/methotrexate was also evaluated.
RESULTS: A total of 105 patients who achieved remission at week 52 discontinued tocilizumab; 51 in ADD-ON continued methotrexate and 54 in SWITCH received no disease-modifying antirheumatic drugs. Sustained DAS28 low disease-activity rates were significantly higher in ADD-ON than in SWITCH (55%vs27%, p=0.005). Sustained remission rates at week 104 were 24% for ADD-ON and 14% for SWITCH (p=0.29). Radiological progression was comparable between both groups (mTSS; 0.37vs0.64, p=0.36). The restart of tocilizumab induced remission in all except two patients after 36 weeks, irrespective of concomitant methotrexate.
CONCLUSION: Sustained low disease activity after tocilizumab discontinuation could be maintained with continued methotrexate in more than half of the patients. Retreatment with tocilizumab led to remission in more than 90% of patients.

METHODS: Patients with RA who experienced an inadequate response to MTX received MTX plus TCZ 162 mg subcutaneously. At 24 weeks, patients who achieved a Disease Activity Score in 28 joints using the erythrocyte sedimentation rate (DAS28-ESR) of ≤3.2 were randomized to receive TCZ monotherapy or to continue treatment with TCZ plus MTX until week 52. The primary outcome measure was the comparison of the mean change in the DAS28-ESR from week 24 to week 40 between the TCZ monotherapy and TCZ plus MTX arms (noninferiority margin of 0.6). Secondary outcome measures included worsening of the DAS28-ESR by ≥1.2, achievement of a DAS28-ESR of <2.6 and ≤3.2, and safety and immunogenicity.
RESULTS: Among the 718 patients enrolled, 296 were randomized at week 24 to receive TCZ monotherapy (n = 147) or TCZ plus MTX (n = 147). The mean changes in the DAS28-ESR from week 24 to week 40 were 0.46 and 0.14 in the TCZ monotherapy arm and the TCZ plus MTX arm, respectively (weighted difference between the groups, 0.318 [95% confidence interval 0.045, 0.592]); discontinuing MTX in TCZ responders was noninferior to continuing MTX.

Abstract: OBJECTIVE: To evaluate whether tocilizumab (TCZ) monotherapy is noninferior to treatment with TCZ plus methotrexate (MTX) for maintaining clinical responses in patients with rheumatoid arthritis (RA) in whom low disease activity is achieved with TCZ plus MTX.
METHODS: Patients with RA who experienced an inadequate response to MTX received MTX plus TCZ 162 mg subcutaneously. At 24 weeks, patients who achieved a Disease Activity Score in 28 joints using the erythrocyte sedimentation rate (DAS28-ESR) of ≤3.2 were randomized to receive TCZ monotherapy or to continue treatment with TCZ plus MTX until week 52. The primary outcome measure was the comparison of the mean change in the DAS28-ESR from week 24 to week 40 between the TCZ monotherapy and TCZ plus MTX arms (noninferiority margin of 0.6). Secondary outcome measures included worsening of the DAS28-ESR by ≥1.2, achievement of a DAS28-ESR of <2.6 and ≤3.2, and safety and immunogenicity.
RESULTS: Among the 718 patients enrolled, 296 were randomized at week 24 to receive TCZ monotherapy (n = 147) or TCZ plus MTX (n = 147). The mean changes in the DAS28-ESR from week 24 to week 40 were 0.46 and 0.14 in the TCZ monotherapy arm and the TCZ plus MTX arm, respectively (weighted difference between the groups, 0.318 [95% confidence interval 0.045, 0.592]); discontinuing MTX in TCZ responders was noninferior to continuing MTX. Safety events were broadly similar between the randomized treatment groups; the most common serious adverse event was infection, which occurred in 2.1% of patients in the TCZ monotherapy group and 2.2% of patients receiving TCZ plus MTX.
CONCLUSION: Patients with RA receiving TCZ plus MTX who achieve low disease activity can discontinue MTX without significant worsening of disease activity during the 16 weeks following MTX discontinuation.","Should patients with RA on DMARDs who are in low disease activity gradually taper off DMARDs, abruptly withdraw DMARDs, or continue DMARDS at the same doses?

The objective of this study was a health economic assessment in Italy.
METHODS: The study was conducted using a pharmacoeconomic model with a 3-year time horizon. Effectiveness was measured as days gained in low disease activity (LDA; DAS28-ESR <3.2) or in remission (DAS28-ESR <2.6). The model simulated the response to treatments, based on the Rotation Or Change (ROC) trial, the probability of discontinuation and switch to a 3rd-line biologic, and the transition to death. Time on treatment curves for 2nd-line biologics were derived from published Italian real-word data. Costs were estimated based on published sources and Italian prices and tariffs.
RESULTS: The switch to tocilizumab after the failure of a first anti-TNF-α was more effective than a second anti-TNF-α, in terms of days in remission (224 vs. 114 days) and of days in LDA (345 vs. 193 days).

To optimise cost-effectiveness, tapering or interruption of TNFi therapy in established RA patients is advocated. We explored whether cessation of TNFi results in impaired vasodilator function and whether this relates to the development of a Disease Activity Score (DAS28)-based flare. Forty-one patients were assessed for eligibility as RA with at least 12 months of low disease activity (based on 28 joint counts); 35 enrolled into the randomised study: 8 were randomised to continue, 27 to stopping TNFi. Forearm vasodilation to acetylcholine (ACh) and sodium nitroprusside (SNP) was assessed before cessation of TNFi therapy (visit 1) and 6 months after (dis)continuation of TNFi or at flare (based on DAS28) whichever came first (visit 2). None of the patients who continued their TNFi therapy flared. Eight out of 22 patients who stopped TNFi therapy flared. The vasodilator response to ACh and SNP was reduced significantly in patients who experienced a flare of RA: In patients who did not experience a flare, the vasodilator response to ACh or SNP was not significantly affected. Vasodilator function is reduced after cessation of TNFi, but only when RA reactivates, indicating that early vasodilator dysfunction is a consequence rather than a cause of systemic inflammation in RA and not specifically related to inhibition of TNFα signalling. Without close monitoring, microvascular damage can occur after TNFi interruption with potential devastating implications for cardiovascular health.

METHODS: This randomized, placebo-controlled non-inferiority study involved patients with severe active RA [28-joint DAS (DAS28) >5.1] who had initiated tocilizumab + MTX at the study start. Patients received open-label tocilizumab (8 mg/kg i.v. every 4 weeks) and open-label MTX. At week 24, patients achieving good/moderate EULAR response were randomized to group A (double-blind MTX taper) or group B (double-blind MTX maintenance); both arms continued open-label tocilizumab. Primary analysis was the proportion of patients maintaining good/moderate EULAR response from week 24 to 60.
RESULTS: The study stopped early due to low recruitment, although the predetermined non-inferiority criteria were still met; 427 patients were enrolled to the open-label phase at week 0. At week 24, EULAR good/moderate response was achieved in 272 individuals (64.4%) who were randomized, 136 in each arm (36% withdrew/were not eligible). Additionally, 45.0% achieved DAS28 ⩽3.2, 33.5% achieved remission (DAS28 <2.6) and 64.2% had a DAS28 change ⩾1.2.

Methods We prospectively enrolled and followed 113 patients who had a high or moderate clinical disease activity index (CDAI) (36 biologic-naïve patients and 77 biologic-experienced patients). Patients received 5 mg of tofacitinib twice daily. Effectiveness and adverse events were examined at month 6 of treatment. Results At month 6, 65 patients (57.5%) reached CDAI50, which is defined as achieving ≥50% improvement. The number of previous biological agents was twice as high in CDAI50 non-responders as in responders (2.2 versus 1.1, p<0.001), but there was no significant difference in the type of previous agents or the reason for discontinuation.

Biologic-naïve patients were more likely to achieve CDAI50 than biologic-experienced patients (80.6% versus 46.8%, p=0.001). Mean CDAI values were higher in biologic-experienced patients (11.4 versus 4.8, p=0.001), and remission rates were higher in biologic-naïve patients (41.7% versus 11.7%, p=0.001). Biologic-naïve patients more rapidly achieved remission. Rates of discontinuation resulting from adverse events were similar in both groups. Conclusion Although tofacitinib can provide an effective treatment option for intractable RA patients, its impact on outcomes is lower in patients with previous biologic failure.","Should patients with RA on DMARDs who are in low disease activity gradually taper off DMARDs, abruptly withdraw DMARDs, or continue DMARDS at the same doses?

28968858,Optimizing treatment with tumour necrosis factor inhibitors in rheumatoid arthritis-a proof of principle and exploratory trial: is dose tapering practical in good responders?,,"OBJECTIVES: RA patients receiving TNF inhibitors (TNFi) usually maintain their initial doses. The aim of the Optimizing Treatment with Tumour Necrosis Factor Inhibitors in Rheumatoid Arthritis trial was to evaluate whether tapering TNFi doses causes loss of clinical response.
METHODS: We enrolled RA patients receiving etanercept or adalimumab and a DMARD with DAS28 under 3.2 for over 3 months. Initially (months 0-6) patients were randomized to control (constant TNFi) or two experimental groups (tapering TNFi by 33 or 66%). Subsequently (months 6-12) control subjects were randomized to taper TNFi by 33 or 66%. Disease flares (DAS28 increasing ⩾0.6 with at least one additional swollen joint) were the primary outcome.
RESULTS: Two hundred and forty-four patients were screened, 103 randomized and 97 treated. In months 0-6 there were 8/50 (16%) flares in controls, 3/26 (12%) with 33% tapering and 6/21 (29%) with 66% tapering. Multivariate Cox analysis showed time to flare was unchanged with 33% tapering but was reduced with 66% tapering compared with controls (adjusted hazard ratio 2.81, 95% CI: 0.99, 7.94; P = 0.051). Analysing all tapered patients after controls were re-randomized (months 6-12) showed differences between groups: there were 6/48 (13%) flares with 33% tapering and 14/39 (36%) with 66% tapering. Multivariate Cox analysis showed 66% tapering reduced time to flare (adjusted hazard ratio 3.47, 95% CI: 1.26, 9.58; P = 0.016).
CONCLUSION: Tapering TNFi by 33% has no impact on disease flares and appears practical in patients in sustained remission and low disease activity states.

28854956,Ultra-low dose of rituximab in rheumatoid arthritis: study protocol for a randomised controlled trial.,2017-08-30,"BACKGROUND: A standard low-dosing schedule of rituximab (RTX; 2 × 500 mg or 1 × 1000 mg) is as effective for active rheumatoid arthritis (RA) as the registered dose (2 × 1000 mg). Moreover, several small uncontrolled studies suggest that even lower-dosed treatment with RTX also leads to good treatment response in patients with RA. Retreatment with such an 'ultra-low' dose RTX in patients who responded well to RTX induction treatment is of special interest, as long-term use of lower RTX doses may lead to shorter infusion duration, lower risk of adverse events and lower costs. However, the effect of ultra-low dose of RTX has not been investigated using a controlled trial of proper design and dimensions.
METHODS/DESIGN: REDO is an investigator driven six-month pragmatic, double-blind, randomised controlled non-inferiority trial on the effects of ultra-low-dose RTX (1 × 500 or 1 × 200 mg) compared to standard low dose (1 × 1000 mg) in RA patients who are being retreated with RTX. A total of 140 RA patients, having reached low disease activity (DAS28CRP < 2.9) after the previous RTX infusion and DAS28CRP < 3.5 at moment of retreatment, are randomised in a ratio of 1:2:2 to 1 × 1000 mg, 1 × 500 mg or 1 × 200 mg. The primary objective is testing non-inferiority of the ultra-low-dose vs. standard low-dose RTX, by comparing mean change in DAS28CRP from baseline to six months to the non-inferiority margin of 0.6. Secondary outcomes over the same period are: function; quality of life; safety; costs; and pharmacokinetics and dynamics as process measures.
DISCUSSION: This study protocol shares characteristics of both early dose finding trials as well as late pragmatic clinical studies. Several choices in the design of this trial are described and possible consequences for RA treatment and expected biosimilar introduction are discussed.

METHODS: Patients (N = 145) with active RA were randomized to placebo, 1mg, 2mg, 4mg, or 8mg baricitinib for the first 12 weeks. During the 52-week extension period, patients on 4mg or 8mg baricitinib remained on the same dose and all other patients were re-randomized to 4mg or 8mg baricitinib. Most patients on 8mg baricitinib were switched to 4mg by week 64 (protocol amendment); data analysis was based on the treatment group at the beginning of the extension period.
RESULTS: Increases in the American College of Rheumatology (ACR) response rates (ACR20, ACR50, and ACR70) observed during the first 12 weeks were maintained during the extension period, accompanied by improvements in ACR core components. At week 64, a large proportion of patients (>40%) had low disease activity. Most treatment-related adverse events were mild or moderate; herpes zoster was the most common reason (11/27 patients) for discontinuation.

28339738,A multi-biomarker score measuring disease activity in rheumatoid arthritis patients tapering adalimumab or etanercept: predictive value for clinical and radiographic outcomes.,,"OBJECTIVE: The aim was to evaluate the predictive value of the baseline multi-biomarker disease activity (MBDA) score in long-standing RA patients with low disease activity tapering TNF inhibitors (TNFi) for successful tapering or discontinuation, occurrence of flare and major flare, and radiographic progression.
METHODS: Dose REduction Strategies of Subcutaneous TNF inhibitors (Dutch Trial Register, NTR 3216) is an 18-month non-inferiority randomized controlled trial comparing tapering of TNFi until discontinuation or flaring with usual care (UC) in long-standing RA patients with stable low disease activity. Flare was defined as DAS28-CRP increase >1.2 or >0.6 if current DAS ⩾3.2; major flare was a flare lasting >3 months, despite treatment intervention. MBDA scores were measured at baseline. Radiographs were scored at baseline and 18 months using the Sharp-van der Heijde score. The area under the receiver operating characteristic (AUROC) curve was used to analyse the capability of baseline MBDA score to predict the above-mentioned outcomes.
RESULTS: Serum samples and outcomes were available for 171 of 180 patients from Dose REduction Strategies of Subcutaneous TNF inhibitors (115 tapering; 56 UC). AUROC analyses showed that baseline MBDA score was not predictive for the above-mentioned clinical outcomes in the taper group, but did predict major flare in the UC group (AUROC = 0.72, 95% CI: 0.56, 0.88).

METHODS: In this multicenter, randomized and parallel treatment trial, 346 patients with active RA (disease activity score (28 joints) [DAS28] (erythrocyte sedimentation rate [ESR]) > 5.1) were enrolled from 9 centers. In phase 1, patients received intensive treatment with methotrexate, leflunomide, and hydroxychloroquine, up to 36 weeks, until remission (DAS28 ≤ 2.6) or a low disease activity (2.6 < DAS28 ≤ 3.2) was achieved. In phase 2, patients achieving remission or low disease activity were followed up with randomization to 1 of 2 step-down protocols: leflunomide plus hydroxychloroquine combination or leflunomide monotherapy. The primary endpoints were good European League Against Rheumatism (EULAR) response (DAS28 (ESR) < 3.2 and a decrease of DAS28 by at least 1.2) during the intensive treatment and the disease state retention rate during step-down maintenance treatment. Predictors of a good EULAR response in the intensive treatment period and disease flare in the maintenance period were sought.
RESULTS: A good EULAR response was achieved in 18.7%, 36.9%, and 54.1% of patients at 12, 24, and 36 weeks, respectively. By 36 weeks, 75.4% of patients achieved good and moderate EULAR responses. Compared with those achieving low disease activity and a high health assessment questionnaire (HAQ > 0.5), patients achieving remission (DAS28 ≤ 2.6) and low HAQ (≤ 0.5) had a significantly higher retention rate when tapering the DMARDs treatment (P = 0.046 and P = 0.01, respectively).

We therefore examined the effect of concomitant MTX dose on the efficacy of adalimumab (ADA) in clinical practice.
METHOD: Sixty-one consecutive RA patients treated with ADA were followed for minimum 52 weeks and retrospectively compared by MTX dose; patients receiving concomitant MTX of 10 mg/week or more (MTX ≥10 mg group) and <10 mg/week (MTX <10 mg group). Disease activity and remission were evaluated by the disease activity score 28 (DAS28) criteria.
RESULTS: The MTX ≥10 mg group consistently showed better improvement in DAS28 and resulted in more patients (52.8%) with DAS28-remission compared with the MTX <10 mg group (26.1%). Multivariate analysis showed that MTX ≥10 mg had a significant effect on DAS28 remission with odds ratio of 5.12.

DESIGN: Randomized controlled clinical trial.
ANIMALS: 20 client-owned dogs with primary IMPA.
PROCEDURES: Dogs were randomly assigned to receive prednisone (starting at 1 mg/kg [0.45 mg/lb], PO, q 12 h; n = 10) or cyclosporine (5 mg/kg [2.3 mg/lb], PO, q 12 h; 10) for 90 days. Cyclosporine-treated dogs also received carprofen, tramadol, or both for the first 7 days for analgesia. Data collection, physical examination, and cytologic analysis of synovial fluid samples were performed on days 0, 14, 45, and 90.

26764260,Disease activity-guided dose optimisation of adalimumab and etanercept is a cost-effective strategy compared with non-tapering tight control rheumatoid arthritis care: analyses of the DRESS study.,2016-01-13,"BACKGROUND: A disease activity-guided dose optimisation strategy of adalimumab or etanercept (TNFi (tumour necrosis factor inhibitors)) has shown to be non-inferior in maintaining disease control in patients with rheumatoid arthritis (RA) compared with usual care. However, the cost-effectiveness of this strategy is still unknown.
METHOD: This is a preplanned cost-effectiveness analysis of the Dose REduction Strategy of Subcutaneous TNF inhibitors (DRESS) study, a randomised controlled, open-label, non-inferiority trial performed in two Dutch rheumatology outpatient clinics. Patients with low disease activity using TNF inhibitors were included. Total healthcare costs were measured and quality adjusted life years (QALY) were based on EQ5D utility scores. Decremental cost-effectiveness analyses were performed using bootstrap analyses; incremental net monetary benefit (iNMB) was used to express cost-effectiveness.
RESULTS: 180 patients were included, and 121 were allocated to the dose optimisation strategy and 59 to control. The dose optimisation strategy resulted in a mean cost saving of -€12 280 (95 percentile -€10 502; -€14 104) per patient per 18 months. There is an 84% chance that the dose optimisation strategy results in a QALY loss with a mean QALY loss of -0.02 (-0.07 to 0.02). The decremental cost-effectiveness ratio (DCER) was €390 493 (€5 085 184; dominant) of savings per QALY lost. The mean iNMB was €10 467 (€6553-€14 037). Sensitivity analyses using 30% and 50% lower prices for TNFi remained cost-effective.
CONCLUSIONS: Disease activity-guided dose optimisation of TNFi results in considerable cost savings while no relevant loss of quality of life was observed. When the minimal QALY loss is compensated with the upper limit of what society is willing to pay or accept in the Netherlands, the net savings are still high.

The dose optimisation strategy resulted in a mean cost saving of -€12 280 (95 percentile -€10 502; -€14 104) per patient per 18 months. There is an 84% chance that the dose optimisation strategy results in a QALY loss with a mean QALY loss of -0.02 (-0.07 to 0.02). The decremental cost-effectiveness ratio (DCER) was €390 493 (€5 085 184; dominant) of savings per QALY lost. The mean iNMB was €10 467 (€6553-€14 037). Sensitivity analyses using 30% and 50% lower prices for TNFi remained cost-effective.
CONCLUSIONS: Disease activity-guided dose optimisation of TNFi results in considerable cost savings while no relevant loss of quality of life was observed. When the minimal QALY loss is compensated with the upper limit of what society is willing to pay or accept in the Netherlands, the net savings are still high.

METHODS: Patients with rheumatoid arthritis (n = 553) were randomized to add tocilizumab to ongoing methotrexate, or switch to tocilizumab plus placebo. If DAS28 ≤3.2 occurred at week 24, treatment remained constant until week 52; here we assessed the DAS28-2 flare rate. Between weeks 52 and 104, patients in sustained remission (DAS28 <2.6 at 2 consecutive visits 12 weeks apart) discontinued tocilizumab and were assessed every 4 weeks. Per protocol, flare was defined as a worsening of disease activity that required treatment beyond the permitted therapy based on investigator opinions (investigator flare) and was compared with the DAS28-2 definition.
RESULTS: After tocilizumab discontinuation, DAS28-2 was sensitive (88-100%), but not specific (57-65%), for detecting investigator flare.

METHODS: Patients with RA (n=91) and stable LDA with ETN 50 mg once weekly (QW)+MTX were included. After 8 weeks with unchanged treatment, 73 patients were randomised in a double-blind design to ETN 50 mg QW+MTX (ETN50), ETN 25 mg QW+MTX (ETN25) or placebo QW+MTX (PBO) for 48 weeks. Patients who flared were declared failures and treated with open-label ETN50 until week 48. The primary outcome was the proportion of patients on ETN50 versus PBO who were non-failures after 48 weeks.
RESULTS: The proportion of non-failure patients was significantly lower with ETN50 (52%; p=0.007) and ETN25 (44%; p=0.044) versus PBO (13%). Median time to failure was significantly shorter with PBO (6 weeks) compared with ETN50 (48 weeks; p=0.001) and ETN25 (36 weeks; p<0.001). The majority of patients who flared regained LDA with open-label ETN50 quickly. Adverse events were consistent with the known side effect profiles of these medications.
CONCLUSIONS: In patients with established RA who have achieved stable LDA on ETN50+MTX, continuing both is superior to PBO+MTX. Reduced dose ETN was also more effective than PBO in maintaining a favourable response, suggesting that a maintenance strategy with reduced dose ETN may be possible in a number of patients with established RA.

DESIGN: Randomised controlled, open label, non-inferiority strategy trial.
SETTING: Two rheumatology outpatient clinics in the Netherlands, from December 2011 to May 2014.
PARTICIPANTS: 180 patients with rheumatoid arthritis and low disease activity using adalimumab or etanercept; 121 allocated to the dose reduction strategy, 59 to usual care.

METHODS: We conducted a retrospective study of TCZ use in RA patients in five French university hospitals between 2009 and 2012. We considered two age groups, under 65 years (<65) and over 65 years (≥65). TCZ efficacy was evaluated at 24 weeks by the European League Against Rheumatism (EULAR) response and remission score.

25169728,Clinical and radiographic outcomes at 2 years and the effect of tocilizumab discontinuation following sustained remission in the second and third year of the ACT-RAY study.,2014-08-28,"OBJECTIVE: To assess the efficacy and safety of tocilizumab (TCZ) plus methotrexate/placebo (MTX/PBO) over 2 years and the course of disease activity in patients who discontinued TCZ due to sustained remission.
METHODS: ACT-RAY was a double-blind 3-year trial. Patients with active rheumatoid arthritis despite MTX were randomised to add TCZ to ongoing MTX (add-on strategy) or switch to TCZ plus PBO (switch strategy). Using a treat-to-target approach, open-label conventional synthetic disease-modifying antirheumatic drugs (csDMARDs), other than MTX, were added from week 24 if Disease Activity Score in 28 joints based on erythrocyte sedimentation rate (DAS28-ESR) >3.2. Between weeks 52 and 104, patients in sustained clinical remission (DAS28-ESR <2.6 at two consecutive visits 12 weeks apart) discontinued TCZ and were assessed every 4 weeks for 1 year. If sustained remission was maintained, added csDMARDs, then MTX/PBO, were discontinued.
RESULTS: Of the 556 randomised patients, 76% completed year 2. Of patients entering year 2, 50.4% discontinued TCZ after achieving sustained remission and 5.9% achieved drug-free remission. Most patients who discontinued TCZ (84.0%) had a subsequent flare, but responded well to TCZ reintroduction. Despite many patients temporarily stopping TCZ, radiographic progression was minimal, with differences favouring add-on treatment. Rates of serious adverse events and serious infections per 100 patient-years were 12.2 and 4.4 in add-on and 15.0 and 3.7 in switch patients. In patients with normal baseline values, alanine aminotransferase elevations >3×upper limit of normal were more frequent in add-on (14.3%) versus switch patients (5.4%).
CONCLUSIONS: Treat-to-target strategies could be successfully implemented with TCZ to achieve sustained remission, after which TCZ was stopped. Biologic-free remission was maintained for about 3 months, but most patients eventually flared. TCZ restart led to rapid improvement.

25128046,Treating to target with etanercept in rheumatoid arthritis: cost-effectiveness of dose reductions when remission is achieved.,2014-05-23,"BACKGROUND: Current management of rheumatoid arthritis (RA) focuses on inducing remission as early as possible to avoid lasting joint damage, and maintenance of remission has become important. A 12-month clinical trial in 834 patients with moderate RA investigated whether etanercept 50 mg/wk could be reduced to half dose or discontinued in patients who achieved low disease activity after 36 weeks.
OBJECTIVE: The objective of this study was to estimate the cost-effectiveness of the three maintenance strategies.
METHODS: A Markov model integrated the three strategies from the clinical trial and extrapolated to 10 years using data from the Swedish RA registry. Assumed treatment strategies after the trial were similar in all three arms, with patients failing to maintain remission on half-dose etanercept or methotrexate alone switching to the full dose of etanercept and patients maintaining remission on full-dose etanercept allowed switching to half dose. Resource use and utilities were taken from an observational study. Results are presented as cost/quality-adjusted life-year (QALY) (both discounted 3%) in the societal perspective.
RESULTS: The cost/QALY gained with half-dose etanercept versus methotrexate ranged from €14,000 to €29,000: Longer simulations result in a higher cost/QALY, as the acquisition cost of etanercept increases. Half-dose etanercept technically dominates the full dose (lower costs [€-3000 to 6300] and similar effectiveness [0.007-0.011]).
CONCLUSIONS: Although ultimately all three strategies explored achieve a similar outcome as all three continuously manage patients to maintain remission, it appears that a dose reduction is the most advantageous strategy in patients with moderate disease activity.",10.1016/j.jval.2014.04.005,"['Comparative Study', 'Journal Article', ""Research Support, Non-U.S. Gov't""]","Title: Treating to target with etanercept in rheumatoid arthritis: cost-effectiveness of dose reductions when remission is achieved.

METHODS: Of 197 RA patients treated with ADA+methotrexate (MTX), 75 patients who met the ADA-free criteria (steroid-free and sustained DAS28-ESR remission for 6 months with stable MTX doses) were studied for 1 year.
RESULTS: The mean disease duration and DAS28-ESR score in 75 patients was 7.5 years and 5.1 at baseline, respectively. The proportion of patients who sustained DAS28-ESR <2.6 (48%) and DAS28-ESR <3.2 (62%) for 1 year were significantly lower in the ADA discontinuation group than in the ADA continuation group; however, in patients with deep remission (DAS28-ESR ≤1.98) identified by receiver operating characteristics analysis following logistic analysis, these rates increased to 68% and 79%, respectively, with no significant difference between both groups.

Our aim was to discuss reasons and opportunities for tapering and discontinuing medication when the target is achieved, in particular of biological agents.
METHODS: Data from the Behandel Strategieën (BeSt) study are presented, a multicentre randomised clinical trial comparing 4 treatment strategies in patients with recent onset active RA (1987 criteria): 1. Sequential monotherapy, 2. Step up to combination therapy (both starting with methotrexate (MTX) monotherapy), 3. Initial combination therapy with MTX, sulfasalazine and prednisone and 4. Initial combination therapy with MTX and infliximab. Treatment adjustments involving dose increases, drug changes or expansion to combination therapy occurred based on three-monthly calculations of the Disease Activity Score (DAS), with a target of ≤2.4. If this was achieved for 2 consecutive evaluations, treatment was tapered (combinations to monotherapy, monotherapy to maintenance dose). Prednisone and infliximab (either as part of initial treatment or as delayed treatment after failure on earlier therapies in arms 1, 2 and -for infliximab- 3) were always tapered and discontinued before other drugs. The outcomes of discontinuation of infliximab are presented.
RESULTS: 77/120 (64%) of patients who started initial infliximab were able to discontinue infliximab, whereas 27/109 (25%) of patients who started delayed infliximab in arms 1-3 could discontinue infliximab. Discontinuation was independent of previous dose increases in order to achieve low DAS. After discontinuation of infliximab, 16 of 27 patients (59%) in arms 1-3 and 34 of 77 patients (44%) in arm 4 suffered a DAS flare >2.4 and had to restart treatment. Median time without infliximab treatment was 17 (IQR 3-47) months, and 29 of the 61 patients (58%) who needed to restart had been at least 1 year without infliximab. Restarting infliximab resulted in DAS ≤2.4 in all patients, and there was no progression of radiological damage. Presence of shared epitope, smoking, and a long treatment with infliximab were independent predictors of infliximab restart.
CONCLUSIONS: Data on infliximab discontinuation in the BeSt study suggest that this possible in 1 in 4 patients, or more if infliximab was the initial treatment, who have had at least 6 consecutive months of low disease activity.

However, long term safety, cost effectiveness and feasibility in clinical practice remain uncertain.
METHODS/DESIGN: This study is a 18-months pragmatic, non-inferiority, cost minimalisation, randomized controlled trial on dose reduction and discontinuation of the subcutaneous tumour necrosis factor (TNF) blockers adalimumab and etanercept in RA patients with low disease activity. 180 RA patients with low disease activity (DAS28 < 3.2 or clinical judgment of the rheumatologist) are randomized 2:1 to either increased spacing and eventually discontinuation after 6 months of the TNF blocker, and usual care. Implementation is done in routine daily care, using treat to target and feedback implementation in both treatment arms. The primary outcome is non-inferiority (NI margin 20%) in cumulative incidence of persistent (> 3 months) RA flare, according to a recently validated DAS28 based flare criterion (DAS28 change > 1.2, or DAS28 increase of 0.6 and current DAS28 ≥ 3.2). Secondary outcomes include mean disease activity, function, radiographic progression, safety and cost effectiveness. Cost per quality adjusted life year (QALY) differences between groups are expressed as a decremental cost effectiveness ratio (DCER), i.e. saved costs divided by (possible) loss in QALY.
DISCUSSION: The design of this study targeted several clinical and methodological issues on TNF blocker dose de-escalation, including how to taper the TNF blockers, the satisfactory control condition, how to define flare, implementation in clinical practice, and the choice of the non-inferiority margin. Pragmatic cost minimalisation studies using non-inferiority designs and DCERs will become more mainstream as cost effectiveness in healthcare gains importance.

23819335,[Relationship of the clinical efficiency of tocilizumab therapy to the serum level of matrix metalloproteinase-3 in patients with rheumatoid arthritis].,,"AIM: To evaluate the impact of tocilizumab (TCZ) therapy on the level of matrix metalloproteinase-3 (MMP-3) 4, 24, and 48 weeks after treatment initiation in relation to the clinical efficiency of TCZ therapy by the Disease Activity Score (DAS28), the Clinical Disease Activity Index (CDAI), and the Simplified Disease Activity Index (SDAI).
SUBJECTS AND METHODS: Forty-two rheumatoid arthritis (RA) patients who had received 6 intravenous infusions of TCZ 8 mg/kg at a 4-week interval during permanent therapy with disease-modifying anti-rheumatic drugs (DMARD) and glucocorticosteroids (GCS) were examined. Then TCZ was discontinued and the patients continued to receive the previous therapy with DMARD and GCS. The European League Against Rheumatism (EULAR) classification criteria, as well as SDAI and CDAI were used to evaluate the efficiency of TCZ therapy. The serum concentration of MMP-3 was measured by enzyme immunoassay using the test systems (Invitrogen, USA).
RESULTS: After 24 weeks of TCZ therapy (at 48 weeks following trial initiation), DAS28 was 4.69 (3.86; 5.44); the SDAI of 17.8 (10.7; 29.5) and the CDAI of 17.1 (7.2; 26.2) corresponded to moderate disease activity. At 48 weeks, DAS28 remission (< 2.6 scores) remained in 5 (11.90%) patients; SDAI (< or = 3.3 scores) and CDAI (< or = 2.8 scores) remissions did in 3 (7.1%) and 4 (9.5%) patients, respectively. There was a significant reduction in MMP-3 concentrations at 4, 24, and 48 weeks of the therapy, which was 61, 73, and 49.40% of the baseline level. ROC analysis indicated that the normalization of MMP-3 levels in RA patients at 24 weeks of TCZ therapy (a cut-off < or =16.5 ng/ml) was associated with the maintenance of remission/low disease activity from SDAI and CDAI 24 weeks after the drug use (the area under the receiver operating curve was 0.762; 95% confidence interval: 0.548-0.976).
CONCLUSION: Analysis of the results of 48-week TCZ therapy suggests its ability to reduce the levels of markers of bone and cartilage destruction in patients with RA.

METHODS: Patient data were from 5 randomized controlled TCZ trials (n = 4211), their open-label extension phases (n = 3512), and a drug interaction study (n = 23). All randomly assigned patients, regardless of previous RA treatment, were analyzed. Measures of safety included number of adverse events (AE), serious AE (SAE), AE leading to treatment discontinuation, laboratory tests, and deaths. Efficacy measures included American College of Rheumatology (ACR) 20/50/70 responses, tender joint count (TJC), swollen joint count (SJC), ACR core set components, and low disease activity (LDA) or Disease Activity Score in 28 joints (DAS28) remission. ACR/European League Against Rheumatism (EULAR) disease remission was a posthoc exploratory analysis.
RESULTS: Total duration of observation was 12,293 patient-years (PY). No new safety signals were identified; infections were the most common AE and SAE. The rate of serious infections was 4.5/100 PY.

21736857,Cost-effectiveness of etanercept treatment in early active rheumatoid arthritis followed by dose adjustment.,2011-07-08,"OBJECTIVES: To explore the cost-effectiveness of early biologic treatment, followed by dose-reduction in the case of remission, of active rheumatoid arthritis (RA), compared with standard treatment with methotrexate (MTX) in Sweden.
METHODS: Effectiveness (function, disease activity, erosions) in early RA for both alternatives was taken from a clinical trial comparing etanercept (ETA) combined with MTX to MTX alone. Patients discontinuing treatment can switch to another or their first biologic treatment. For patients in remission (Disease Activity Score [DAS28] < 2.6), ETA is reduced to half the dose. Return to full dose occurs when DAS28 reaches ≥ 3.2 again. Costs and utilities by level of functional capacity from an observational study are used. The model is analyzed as a micro-simulation and results are presented from the societal perspective for Sweden, for 10 years; costs (€2008) and effects are discounted at 3 percent. Sensitivity analysis was performed for the perspective, the time horizon, switching, and dose-reduction.
RESULTS: The main analysis conservatively assumes 50 percent switching at discontinuation. The cost per quality-adjusted life-year (QALY) gained with early ETA/MTX treatment is €13,500 (societal perspective, incremental cost of €15,500 and incremental QALYs of 1.15).

21515916,Discontinuation of infliximab and potential predictors of persistent low disease activity in patients with early rheumatoid arthritis and disease activity score-steered therapy: subanalysis of the BeSt study.,2011-04-24,"OBJECTIVE: To describe the disease course after the cessation of infliximab in early rheumatoid arthritis patients with disease activity score (DAS)-steered treatment and to identify predictors of persistent low disease activity.
METHODS: In a post-hoc analysis of the BeSt study, disease activity and joint damage progression were observed in patients treated with methotrexate plus infliximab, who discontinued infliximab after achieving low disease activity (DAS ≤2.4) for 6 months. Predictors were identified using Cox regression analysis.
RESULTS: 104 patients discontinued infliximab, of whom 77 had received infliximab plus methotrexate as initial treatment. Mean DAS at the time of infliximab cessation was 1.3, median symptom duration was 23 months and median Sharp/van derHeijde score was 5.5. The median follow-up was 7.2 years. Infliximab was re-introduced after loss of low disease activity in 48%, after a median of 17 months. The joint damage progression rate did not increase in the year after cessation, regardless of flare. After re-introduction of infliximab, 84% of these patients again achieved a DAS ≤2.4. In the multivariable model, smoking, infliximab treatment duration ≥18 months and shared epitope (SE) were independently associated with the re-introduction of infliximab: 6% of the non-smoking, SE-negative patients treated <18 months needed infliximab re-introduction.
CONCLUSION: Cessation of infliximab was successful in 52%, with numerically higher success rates in patients initially treated with infliximab. Of the 48% who flared, 84% regained low disease activity. The joint damage progression rate did not increase in the year after cessation.

21415052,"The impact of four dynamic, goal-steered treatment strategies on the 5-year outcomes of rheumatoid arthritis patients in the BeSt study.",2011-03-17,"OBJECTIVE: To compare clinical and radiological outcomes of four dynamic treatment strategies in recent-onset rheumatoid arthritis (RA) after 5 years follow-up.
METHODS: 508 patients with recent-onset RA were randomly assigned into four treatment strategies: sequential monotherapy; step-up combination therapy; initial combination with prednisone; initial combination with infliximab. Treatment adjustments were made based on 3-monthly disease activity score (DAS) measurements (if DAS >2.4 next treatment step; if DAS ≤ 2.4 during ≥ 6 months taper to maintenance dose; if DAS <1.6 during ≥ 6 months stop antirheumatic treatment). Primary and secondary outcomes were functional ability, joint damage progression, health-related quality of life and (drug-free) remission percentages.
RESULTS: After 5 years, 48% of patients were in clinical remission (DAS <1.6) and 14% in drug-free remission, irrespective of initial treatment. After an earlier improvement in functional ability and quality of life with initial combination therapy, from 1 year onwards clinical outcomes were comparable across the groups and stable during 5 years. The initial combination groups showed less joint damage in year 1. In years 2-5 annual progression was comparable across the groups. After 5 years, initial combination therapy resulted in significantly less joint damage progression, reflecting the earlier clinical response.
CONCLUSION: Irrespective of initial treatment, an impressive improvement in clinical and radiological outcomes of RA patients can be achieved with dynamic treatment aimed at reducing disease activity, leading to 48% remission, 14% drug-free remission and sustained functional improvement.

METHODS: We conducted a 15-year follow-up study of 87 patients with ERA treated since diagnosis with disease-modifying anti-rheumatic drugs (DMARDs) according to the 'sawtooth' strategy. The patients were divided into groups according to the continuity of treatment: (A) 'continuous DMARDs', (B) 'discontinued and restarted DMARDs', and (C) 'permanently discontinued DMARDs'. The main outcome measurements included the Health Assessment Questionnaire (HAQ), the Larsen score, and clinical remission according to the American Rheumatism Association (ARA) criteria.
RESULTS: Seventy (80%) patients participated in the 15-year follow-up. DMARDs were discontinued in 20 (29%) patients due either to remission or to a symptom-free period of the disease. The disease flared up in nine (45%) of these patients, in some patients several years after the discontinuation. At the 15-year follow-up, 59 (84%) patients were on DMARDs; only three (4%) were using biologicals. Functional capacity remained good in all groups (mean HAQ score 0.52). The mean Larsen score was higher (54) in group A than in groups B (25) and C (12) (p =0.001). The remission rate was 64% in group C and considerably lower in groups A (6%) and B (0%) (p<0.001).

17985420,Treatment of recent-onset rheumatoid arthritis: lessons from the BeSt study.,,"OBJECTIVE: To determine the efficacy, toxicity, utilities, and costs of 4 treatment strategies for patients with recent-onset rheumatoid arthritis (RA).
METHODS: 508 patients with recent-onset active RA [mean Disease Activity Score (DAS) 4.4, mean Health Assessment Questionnaire score 1.4] were randomized into 4 strategy groups: (1) sequential monotherapy; (2) step-up to combination therapy [both starting with methotrexate (MTX)]; (3) initial combination therapy with MTX, sulfasalazine, and prednisone; (4) initial combination therapy with MTX and infliximab. Treatment adjustments were based on 3-monthly calculations of the DAS (target DAS ? 2.4), by research nurses who were blinded to the strategy group. They also collected data on treatment toxicity, functional ability, costs, and utilities. Yearly anonymized radiographs of hands and feet were scored in random order by 2 independent physicians, using the Sharp/van der Heijde score.
RESULTS: Functional ability improved significantly earlier in Groups 3 and 4 than in Groups 1 and 2, but was comparable among the groups at the end of the first year of treatment. Radiographic joint damage progression was significantly lower in Groups 3 and 4 than in Groups 1 and 2, but low in all groups compared to other RA populations, probably due to DAS-driven treatment adjustments in all groups. More patients in Groups 3 and 4 than in Groups 1 and 2 achieved clinical remission (DAS 1.6), and patients who achieved early continued remission in Groups 3 and 4 had significantly less joint damage progression than those who achieved the same in Groups 1 and 2. More patients could taper and stop all antirheumatic drugs and still retained remission in Group 4 (17% at t = 3 years) than in the other groups (10%, 5%, 9%, respectively). Toxicity was comparable between groups. Quality of life measures were significantly higher in Group 4 than in the other groups, but costs of treatment were also the highest in Group 4. Depending on the method used, higher productivity in Group 4 compensated for the higher medical costs.
CONCLUSION: In patients with recent-onset RA, initial combination therapy including prednisone or infliximab results in earlier clinical improvement and less joint damage progression than initial monotherapy. Initial treatment with infliximab resulted in the highest quality of life, highest productivity, and highest medical costs. DAS-driven treatment adjustments were effective to suppress disease activity and damage progression in all groups.",,"['Journal Article', 'Randomized Controlled Trial']","Title: Treatment of recent-onset rheumatoid arthritis: lessons from the BeSt study.
Abstract: OBJECTIVE: To determine the efficacy, toxicity, utilities, and costs of 4 treatment strategies for patients with recent-onset rheumatoid arthritis (RA).
METHODS: 508 patients with recent-onset active RA [mean Disease Activity Score (DAS) 4.4, mean Health Assessment Questionnaire score 1.4] were randomized into 4 strategy groups: (1) sequential monotherapy; (2) step-up to combination therapy [both starting with methotrexate (MTX)]; (3) initial combination therapy with MTX, sulfasalazine, and prednisone; (4) initial combination therapy with MTX and infliximab. Treatment adjustments were based on 3-monthly calculations of the DAS (target DAS ? 2.4), by research nurses who were blinded to the strategy group. They also collected data on treatment toxicity, functional ability, costs, and utilities.

17083767,Aiming at low disease activity in rheumatoid arthritis with initial combination therapy or initial monotherapy strategies: the BeSt study.,,"AIM: To evaluate the efficacy and safety of four different treatment strategies for patients with early rheumatoid arthritis (RA).
METHODS: In the BeSt study, 508 patients with newly diagnosed (< 2 years) active RA were randomised to be treated according to four treatment strategies: 1. sequential monotherapy, 2. step up to combination therapy (both starting with methotrexate), 3. initial combination therapy with methotrexate, sulphasalazine, and a tapered high dose of prednisone, and 4. initial combination therapy with methotrexate and infliximab. Three-monthly therapy adjustments were dictated by calculation of the Disease Activity Score (DAS), with the goal to achieve and maintain a DAS <or= 2.4. Functional ability was measured every 3 months with the Health Assessment Questionnaire. Radiographs of hands and feet were assessed yearly, blinded for patient identity and treatment, and in random order, to measure joint damage progression (Sharp/van der Heijde score).
RESULTS: After 2 years of treatment, 80% of all patients achieved the goal of DAS <or= 2.4, and 42% reached clinical remission (DAS < 1.6). Initial combination therapy, either with prednisone (group 3) or with infliximab (group 4), resulted in earlier improvement in functional ability, more continuous clinical remission (DAS < 1.6), and less joint damage progression than initial monotherapy (groups 1 and 2). Patients in groups 1 and 2 needed more therapy adjustments, including introduction of combination therapy with prednisone or infliximab, to achieve a DAS <or= 2.4, whereas many patients in groups 3 and 4 were able to taper their medication to sulphasalazine or methotrexate, respectively, monotherapy. The adverse events profile was comparable in all groups. The presence or absence of rheumatoid factor, HLA DR4, or anti-CCP was not associated with radiologic damage progression.
CONCLUSION: In patients with early, active RA, remarkable clinical improvement and suppression of joint damage progression can be achieved with frequent, objectively steered treatment adjustments. The best chance for an early clinical and radiologic response lies with initial combination therapy with either methotrexate, sulphasalazine and prednisone or with methotrexate and infliximab, which can be tapered to DMARD monotherapy once low disease activity is achieved.",,"['Journal Article', 'Randomized Controlled Trial']","Title: Aiming at low disease activity in rheumatoid arthritis with initial combination therapy or initial monotherapy strategies: the BeSt study.

METHODS: A randomized, double-blind, double-observer, placebo-controlled multicenter trial of 48 weeks was conducted. Sixty-five RA patients who had a suboptimal response to >/=12 weeks of MTX therapy were randomly assigned to receive weekly IM gold or placebo in addition to MTX. Gold was administered according to a standard protocol developed for the study. The primary outcome measure was the percentage of patients who met the American College of Rheumatology (ACR) 20% improvement criteria (achieved an ACR20 response) at week 48. Secondary outcomes included the percentages of patients achieving ACR50 and ACR70 responses, the individual criteria that make up the primary outcome, quality of life, direct and indirect health care costs, intraarticular steroid use, and adverse events, among other measures. Statistical analyses were based on an intent-to-treat strategy.
RESULTS: Sixty-one percent of patients receiving gold achieved an ACR20 response compared with 30% of patients receiving placebo (chi(2) = 6.04, P = 0.014; logistic regression odds ratio 3.64 [95% confidence interval 1.3, 10.4], P = 0.016).

OBJECTIVE: To evaluate the efficacy and safety of leflunomide versus placebo when added to ongoing, stable-dose methotrexate therapy in patients with persistently active rheumatoid arthritis.
DESIGN: 24-week, multicenter, randomized, double-blind, placebo-controlled trial.
SETTING: 20 centers in the United States and Canada.
PATIENTS: Patients with persistent rheumatoid arthritis, as defined by American College of Rheumatology (ACR) criteria, despite receiving methotrexate for at least 6 months.

A randomized study of treatment with methotrexate, cyclosporin A, and intraarticular corticosteroids compared with sulfasalazine alone.",,"OBJECTIVE: To determine whether a regimen of methotrexate, cyclosporin A, and corticosteroids introduced at onset in poor-prognosis rheumatoid arthritis (RA) can produce a significant improvement in outcome compared with standard monotherapy with sulfasalazine (SSZ).
METHODS: Eighty-two consecutive patients presenting with new, untreated RA of less than 12 months' duration who fulfilled criteria for poor long-term outcome were randomized to receive either combination therapy (n = 40) or SSZ alone (n = 42). The primary outcome measures were remission and American College of Rheumatology (ACR) criteria for 20% improvement at 48 weeks.
RESULTS: After 48 weeks, the numbers of patients who met the ACR criteria for 20% improvement were not significantly different between the two groups (combination 58% versus SSZ 45%), and similar numbers of patients had persisting clinical remission (approximately 10% both groups). During the first 3 months, there were significantly greater reductions in parameters of disease activity in the combination group. By 24 weeks, the swollen and tender joint counts, C-reactive protein levels, and erythrocyte sedimentation rates had fallen significantly in both groups, with a greater improvement in the swollen and tender joint count in the combination group. At 48 weeks, the radiographic damage score had increased by a median of 1 (range 0-42.5) in the combination group and 1.25 (range 0-72.5) in the SSZ group (P = 0.28; although there were significant differences in the scores for the right hand). There were significantly fewer withdrawals due to lack of efficacy in the combination group than in the SSZ group (1 of 40 versus 10 of 42; P = 0.007). In the combination group, dose reduction was needed in 22.5% because of hypertension and in 22.5% because of elevated creatinine levels. Over 48 weeks, serum creatinine increased in both groups, but particularly in the combination arm.
CONCLUSION: In poor-prognosis RA patients, ""aggressive"" combination therapy led to more rapid disease suppression but did not result in significantly better ACR response or remission rates. This suggests that in poor-prognosis disease, an approach based on identifying patients with poor treatment responses before extra therapy is added (""step-up"" approach) may be more appropriate than the use of combination therapy in all patients from the outset.",,"['Clinical Trial', 'Comparative Study', 'Journal Article', 'Randomized Controlled Trial', ""Research Support, Non-U.S. Gov't""]","Title: Treatment of poor-prognosis early rheumatoid arthritis.

By 24 weeks, the swollen and tender joint counts, C-reactive protein levels, and erythrocyte sedimentation rates had fallen significantly in both groups, with a greater improvement in the swollen and tender joint count in the combination group. At 48 weeks, the radiographic damage score had increased by a median of 1 (range 0-42.5) in the combination group and 1.25 (range 0-72.5) in the SSZ group (P = 0.28; although there were significant differences in the scores for the right hand). There were significantly fewer withdrawals due to lack of efficacy in the combination group than in the SSZ group (1 of 40 versus 10 of 42; P = 0.007). In the combination group, dose reduction was needed in 22.5% because of hypertension and in 22.5% because of elevated creatinine levels. Over 48 weeks, serum creatinine increased in both groups, but particularly in the combination arm.
CONCLUSION: In poor-prognosis RA patients, ""aggressive"" combination therapy led to more rapid disease suppression but did not result in significantly better ACR response or remission rates. This suggests that in poor-prognosis disease, an approach based on identifying patients with poor treatment responses before extra therapy is added (""step-up"" approach) may be more appropriate than the use of combination therapy in all patients from the outset.","Should patients with RA on DMARDs who are in low disease activity gradually taper off DMARDs, abruptly withdraw DMARDs, or continue DMARDS at the same doses?

","<Exclusion Reason: Invalid Study Design>. The study focuses on comparing combination therapy with monotherapy in poor-prognosis early rheumatoid arthritis patients, without addressing tapering, withdrawal, or continuation of DMARDs in patients with low disease activity. Furthermore, although it is a randomized clinical trial, it does not align with the PICO framework of the clinical question.",Excluded
8724309,Intravenous immunoglobulin in the treatment of polyarticular juvenile rheumatoid arthritis: a phase I/II study. Pediatric Rheumatology Collaborative Study Group.,,"OBJECTIVE: To obtain preliminary information about the safety and efficacy of intravenous immune globulin (IVIG: Iveegam, Immuno AG, Vienna) in the treatment of polyarticular juvenile rheumatoid arthritis (poly-JRA) resistant to other forms therapy.
METHODS: We used a multicentered, phase I/II blinded-withdrawal design with stratified entry. All patients began by receiving open infusions of IVIG at a dose between 1.5 and 2.0 g/kg/infusion (100 g maximum) bimonthly for the first 2 months, then monthly for up to 6 months. Beginning at Month 3, those who met the criteria for ""clinically important improvement"" were randomized to receive monthly infusions for 4 months of either placebo or IVIG in a double blind (DB) phase. Patients were permitted nonsteroidal antiinflammatory drugs, slow acting antirheumatic drugs, and low dose (< 10 mg/day) prednisone at constant doses. An ""early escape"" provision in the DB allowed those who showed ""clinically important worsening"" to again receive IVIG (if taking placebo) or a higher dose of IVIG (if taking the lower dose of IVIG).
RESULTS: Efficacy. Twenty-five children entered the trial and 19 (76%) met the criteria for ""clinically important improvement"" during the open phase (OP) and entered the DB. Three patients completed the OP but failed to meet the criteria for response, and 3 patients dropped out of the OP, none of whom showed benefit from IVIG. Treatment effect sizes produced by IVIG were moderate to large for all variables in the OP. Patients who continued IVIG in the DB continued to show improvement over that achieved in the OP. Those given placebo showed a rapid loss of efficacy, suggesting IVIG has a limited duration of effect after discontinuation. Safety. No patient developed serious or unexpected adverse side effects in the open or DB phases, and none dropped out of the study due to toxicity or side effects.
CONCLUSION: Substantial clinical improvement from IVIG is produced in about three-fourths of patients with poly-JRA during open administration, but the duration of the beneficial effect is short after discontinuation. Those with disease < 3 years' duration may be more likely to respond than those who have had their disease for > 5 years. Short term safety is excellent.",,"['Clinical Trial', 'Clinical Trial, Phase I', 'Clinical Trial, Phase II', 'Journal Article', 'Multicenter Study', 'Randomized Controlled Trial', ""Research Support, Non-U.S. Gov't"", ""Research Support, U.S. Gov't, P.H.S.""]","Title: Intravenous immunoglobulin in the treatment of polyarticular juvenile rheumatoid arthritis: a phase I/II study.
