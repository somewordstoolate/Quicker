                "a": "Concern about risk of bias associated with handling of incomplete outcome data.",
                "b": "Downgraded by one level due to serious indirectness. The evidence is based on a population who are starting MTX treatment (MTX-naive and not on folic acid) with different folic acid doses (10 mg/week vs 30 mg/week).",
                "c": "Downgraded by one level due to serious imprecision. Small sample size.",
                "d": "Folic acid dose is 5-10 mg/week.",
                "e": "Folic acid dose is 27.5-30mg/week.",
                "f": "Downgraded by one level due to serious inconsistency. I2=79%.",
                "g": "Downgraded by one level due to serious indirectness. The evidence is based on a population who are starting MTX treatment (MTX-naive and not on folic acid) with different folic acid doses (5-10 mg/week vs 27.5-30 mg/week).",
                "h": "According to the Cochrane's handbook, Cohen suggested that SMD=0.2 be considered a 'small' effect size, 0.5 represents a 'medium' effect size and 0.8 a 'large' effect size. This means that if two groups' means do not differ by 0.2 standard deviations or more, the difference is trivial, even if it is statistically significant.",
                "i": "Downgraded by one level due to serious imprecision. Confidence interval includes both values suggesting no effect and values suggesting harm.",
                "j": "Downgraded by two levels due to very serious imprecision. Confidence interval includes both values suggesting no effect and values suggesting harm. Very low number of events."
